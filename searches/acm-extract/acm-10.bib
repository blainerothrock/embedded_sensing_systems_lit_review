abstract = {As an important economic crop in China, the planting history of mulberry can be traced back to more than 5,000 years ago. Since the 1970s, Yizhou District, Hechi City, Guangxi Province has begun to establish a special mulberry silkworm production service management agency. Now Yizhou District, Hechi City, Guangxi Province has become an important base for mulberry planting. Mulberry leaves are not only the main feed for sericulture, but also widely used in traditional Chinese medicine and daily life. Mulberry planting technology has also been continuously improved with the changes of the times. Nowadays, with the rapid development of agricultural modernization, traditional planting methods in Yizhou area have also begun to face many challenges, including low planting efficiency, unstable yield, and difficult management of large plantations. These problems directly affect the quality and yield of mulberry leaves, and directly affect the healthy development of sericulture and the economic income of mulberry silkworm farmers. To solve the above problems, this study proposed a method based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and Web Geographic Information System (WebGIS). The system monitors the soil and environmental data of mulberry planting areas in real time, and provides farmers with accurate planting suggestions and decision support after system processing. By using WebGIS technology to map planting plots and sensors and other equipment, it is easier for farmers to manage planting areas. After field deployment and verification in Yizhou area, the system has been proven to effectively improve planting efficiency, stabilize yields, and reduce production costs. In addition, the implementation of the system is also of great significance to improving the sustainability of agricultural ecology. It not only improves the scientific and technological level of regional agriculture, but also provides new research directions and data support for agricultural scientific research. It has good development prospects and practical application value.},

abstract = {As the adoption of wearable and smart devices increases, their privacy and security are still a concern. These devices collect sensitive data and constantly communicate with each other, posing new privacy threats that need to be understood and addressed. In this paper, we analyze the privacy of smart devices from a multi-device perspective. The central premise of our work is that information available at each device may be non-sensitive or lightly so, but by orchestrating information from multiple connected smart devices, it is possible to infer sensitive content. To verify this, we conduct a user study to understand user perceptions towards privacy on smart devices and contrast them with their actual behavior while operating these devices. We then present an attack framework that can leverage tightly coupled and connected smart devices, such as mobile, wearable, and smart TV, to leak sensitive information inferred from individually non-sensitive data. Finally, we introduce a tool based on NLP techniques to identify potential privacy vulnerabilities on smart devices and propose an integrated solution to increase smart devices' security. This analysis helps close the gap between user's perception and reality regarding privacy risks within their smart ecosystem.},

abstract = {In recent years, with the rapid development of digitization and Internet technology, the variety and quantity of malware are increasing, and the network security situation is becoming increasingly severe. Faced with the challenge of malware using advanced escape techniques, traditional dynamic detection methods are not accurate and sensitive enough. Therefore, we propose a dynamic malware detection method based on circumventing the API weighting algorithm to solve the above problems. Specifically, this paper studies the escape technology of malware using HOOK API to hide malicious behaviors, organizes the analysis of al-khaser, pafish and other escape samples, and proposes a weighting algorithm for typical escape APIs. The algorithm highlights the escape behavior and improves the sensitivity of the detection model by weighting the difference between the number of escape API calls in the normal environment and the sandbox environment. In addition, TF-IDF is used for feature extraction, effectively highlighting features that are important in a particular sample but uncommon across all samples. Finally, combining TF-IDF and Bi-LSTM models, the malware detection model is constructed to effectively extract features and classify them, which improves the accuracy and efficiency of detection. The experimental results show that the detection accuracy of this method on the Alibaba Cloud malware detection dataset reaches 91.26\%.},

abstract = {In the national education system, school buses play a crucial role in ensuring the safe transportation of children. However, the frequent occurrence of school bus accidents, resulting in tragic casualties and economic losses, has sparked widespread concern and deep anxiety in society. To thoroughly reverse this situation, an innovative school bus safety monitoring solution has been developed, with STM32 serving as the core platform. This system integrates precise environmental monitoring modules, including temperature and humidity sensors, Hall effect sensors, and advanced GPS and Beidou positioning technologies, to monitor the environmental conditions inside the school bus in real-time, such as accurately recording travel speed, geographical location, and air quality. The data is clearly displayed on a screen to ensure that the driver can always be aware of the vehicle's status. If the speed exceeds a preset safety threshold, the system will trigger an alarm and instantly alert the driver through a buzzer. Similarly, when the air quality exceeds standards, the built-in intelligent fan will automatically activate to ensure fresh air inside the bus. In addition, RFID technology has been introduced to confirm students' boarding and disembarking status through card swiping, ensuring the safety of each student. This system also adopts WIFI wireless transmission, allowing mobile phones to display detected data and enabling remote control functions. The above modules work together to fulfill the detection and control functions of the school bus, creating a healthy and safe riding environment for students.},

abstract = {The accuracy of six-dimensional force sensors is affected by environmental factors and usage conditions, the traditional calibration methods often require disassembly of the sensors, which is inefficient and not conducive to industrial production. Therefore, this paper proposes a design method for an online calibration load device specifically for six-dimensional force sensors in intelligent robotic arms. The device realizes online calibration by means of a standard single-dimensional force sensor without disassembly during the normal operation of the robotic arm, thus improving the measurement accuracy and work efficiency. In this paper, the detailed design and simulation analysis are carried out to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the device. The simulation results show that the device is capable of realizing the application of loads to each dimension of the six-dimensional force sensor, and the material selection meets the strength requirements. In addition, the online calibration method simplifies the calibration process and has good versatility and scalability, which can be applied to different types of robotic arms and sensors in the future, providing a new direction for the development of industrial standards and robotic arm technology.},

Although software teams have used digital tools for virtual face-to-face communication (e.g., Google Meet), these tools have usually not been adequate to promote the engagement and collaboration of software team members. Metaverse, an immersive virtual environment, has emerged as a promising platform to replicate physical presence and address these challenges. In this study, we proposed design requirements to support the development of an immersive environment tailored for agile teams, specifically focusing on sprint planning ceremonies. Based on these requirements, we developed a prototype to support sprint planning ceremonies. To evaluate the environment, we conducted three rounds of sprint planning sessions with the participation of twelve agile software developers. Our findings revealed that participants experienced a high sense of immersion and enhanced their engagement supported by the environment features. These results suggest that the Metaverse can be seen as a potential workplace for agile teams collaboration.},

abstract = {As eXtended Reality (XR) continues to expand in applications ranging from gaming to education and training, enhancing user Quality of Experience (QoE) remains a critical focus. A key factor in XR environments is how users perceive their own bodies during interactive tasks, such as object manipulation and navigation. The accuracy and fidelity of these self-representations can significantly affect immersion, realism, and overall user engagement. This paper explores the influence of egocentric segmentation techniques on user experience within XR. Using the Quest 3 headset, we developed immersive experiences where users interact with virtual elements through representations of their hands, arms, and upper body. Participants performed two interactive tasks under three hand visualization conditions. While the visualization differed in levels of detail and fidelity, the tasks were either static or translational based. Subjective assessments measured global and visual QoE, sense of presence and perceived performance level across these conditions. All software developed is publicly available, ensuring transparency and reproducibility. While no significant differences were observed in overall subjective measurements across representation variations, users reported heightened immersion for all conditions; thus, showing the validity of these methods to be able to blend physical and virtual realities without degrading the experience. However, the results indicate that the difference between purely virtual environment representations together with a photorealistic body representation can affect the consistency of the experience. In particular, the involvement factor for the translational task suggests degradation when the whole arm is not shown (only the hand) and occlusions are not well managed, so that manual interactions based on photorealism do not meet expectations. Furthermore, visual results suggest difference between virtual and photorealistic hands, possibly due to their contrast with a non-realistic environment. Future research should focus on improving the fidelity of the virtual environments so body representation matches the representation of the environment.},

abstract = {Our ancestors communicated stories through tapestries, using them to adorn public and private spaces. Traditionally, these tapestries were static artworks hanging on walls without audience interaction. Nevertheless, textiles offer a versatile medium, crafted from diverse materials and colours and manipulated to produce unique, touch-responsive textures. Our work integrates the tactile capabilities of weaving with capacitive sensor technology to create an interactive art installation that fosters non-formal learning and raises awareness about marine noise pollution and its harmful effects on marine ecosystems. Marine animals, particularly cetaceans, rely heavily on sound for communication, navigation, and hunting. Noise pollution disrupts these essential functions, presenting severe threats to their survival. By harnessing the storytelling potential of tapestries and the power of capacitive sensors connected to a microcontroller, we developed a unique and immersive art installation that educates the public and decision-makers about these pressing issues. This study evaluates the impact of this interactive tapestry on its audience. Qualitative and quantitative results suggest valuable insights, showcasing that Tapest[o]ry engages participants through its tangible storytelling interface, fostering emotional responses such as empathy and compassion. Participants shared their thoughts about awareness of marine noise pollution, demonstrating the possible use of interactive art installations as storytelling tools. Our findings highlight the potential of integrating traditional textile techniques with interactive technology and storytelling to create powerful educational experiences outside formal learning environments, encouraging personal reflection and support for environmental issues.},

abstract = {Raman spectroscopy is becoming a potential disease diagnosis method due to its rapidity, high sensitivity, and low water interference. With the development of machine learning, traditional machine learning models and deep learning models represented by convolutional neural networks have been widely used in Raman spectroscopy classification. In view of the limitations of existing models in Raman spectroscopy modeling capabilities, this study designed a hybrid self-attention network with multi-scale convolutional embedding (MCESANet). The model integrates attention networks and multi-layer perceptrons, combines multi-scale convolutional embedding and multi-head self-attention mechanisms to obtain accurate feature representations of Raman spectral sequences, and uses multi-layer perceptrons to effectively transform feature representations into final recognition results. The experimental results of the dataset constructed from serum Raman spectra of patients with various autoimmune diseases and healthy controls showed that the proposed model had the best effect, with all metrics of the model reaching 98.35\%, and was stable on unbalanced small datasets, which was superior to traditional machine learning models and popular deep learning methods.},

This paper proposes a transformer state monitoring system based on TCSM, aiming to achieve real-time monitoring and diagnosis of transformer operating conditions through non-intrusive sound analysis. The system comprises three layers: data collection, edge computing, and software application. The data collection layer uses high-sensitivity acoustic sensors and vibration sensors to capture the sound wave signals of transformers and preprocess them to improve data quality. The edge computing layer extracts features from the sound signals using advanced feature extraction algorithms such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and analyzes the signals using the TCSM model to identify abnormal patterns and make local decisions. The software application layer provides an intuitive user interface and remote monitoring capabilities, combining historical data analysis and trend prediction to support maintenance decisions. Experimental results show that the proposed system significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of real-time performance, accuracy, and intelligence, effectively enhancing transformer operation and maintenance efficiency and the reliability of the power grid.},

abstract = {Since fruit plays an important role in the human diet, pomiculture has a significant economic impact on agricultural countries worldwide. However, the lack of manual labor makes it necessary to explore alternative solutions for the harvesting process. Emerging technologies that are modernizing agriculture, including robotics, machine learning, and drones, provide a promising direction to address these types of challenges. More specifically, the use of automated harvesting robotic systems could mitigate labor shortages by operating more hours than humans and reducing the physical demands of traditional manual harvesting. The widely available, cost-effective electronics and sensors, along with the easily developed machine learning models, make it feasible to construct robotic systems for autonomous detection and picking of fruits. On the other hand, the deployment of robotic systems in orchards remains a challenge due to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of these environments, leaving room for further research. This paper aims to develop a machine learning architecture to identify oranges and orange trees in orchard environments, using both ground and UAV imagery. The proposed model is an integral part of a ground-based autonomous robotic harvesting system. This paper describes the methodology followed, discusses the preliminary results and proposes future work to contribute to the field of automated agricultural systems. Despite the medium-size dataset and the contribution of a user-friendly platform for developing models for edge devices, the results of the models are very encouraging, and through the evaluation the most suitable algorithms were selected for detecting trees upon entering an orchard and oranges at close range.},

abstract = {Globally, there are many problems related to poverty and educational inequality. Because they are static and cannot easily adjust to changing situations, traditional approaches to better education frequently fail. In order to solve this issue, this paper uses reinforcement learning to create a sustainable educational intervention model. The intention is to use reinforcement learning in order to intelligently distribute educational resources and assist lessen poverty on a global scale by making better decisions. It is a model that the research develops to demonstrate how poverty and education are related. The model takes into account a number of variables, including socioeconomic status, poverty rates, and educational attainment. Then, in order to maximize the distribution of resources, a multi-agent decision-making method is created, in which families, governments, and schools collaborate. The study then presents sustainability indicators, such as environmental, and economic factors. These indicators are included in the reinforcement learning reward system, making sure that policies are always effective in the long run and able to adapt to the surroundings. In the experimental part, the model is tested by means of actual data and simulations, contrasting with more recent approaches and conventional approaches. The performance of the various approaches by using the MADDPG performs significantly better than the others. It particularly increases the amount of money spent by the government and has more measurable effects on the environment, particularly with regard to the use of resources and the efficacy of the entire policy. This work makes a useful and sensible approach to combating poverty on a global scale by moving from fixed to flexible solutions with the use of instructional tactics. Additionally, it offers helpful technical advice to support the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the UN.},

The propagation strategy in taint analysis is a very critical research issue. Formulating an effective taint propagation strategy plays a decisive role in the accuracy of taint analysis results and the efficiency of the analysis process. First, the basic principles of taint analysis are introduced. Secondly, focusing on the implementation of taint analysis in different programming and application environments, the technical development status of taint propagation strategies at the source code level and binary code level is analyzed in detail, and its advantages and disadvantages are summarized. Finally, it is pointed out that in order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of analysis, the future taint analysis technology will show a research trend of integration with fuzz testing, deep learning and other technologies.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the prediction and assessment methods of flood disasters due to heavy rainfall, especially focusing on analyzing the extreme weather performance of ecologically fragile zones in China. Initial discussions are devoted to the discussion of the development of flood disaster prediction methods in and outside of the country, traditional methods taking support from depth loss curves together with modern applications in the realm of machine learning, remote sensing and GIS technologies. Based on that a vulnerability assessment system focusing on natural and anthropogenic factors was developed and subject to the analysis using data normalization and a random forest model. The analysis indicates that the rainfall is the most important factor affecting flooding into the disaster area, while natural factors such as forests reduce the risk of the disaster. In forecasting, the author applied a basic linear regression model along with an LSTM neural network for predicting the type of land use change and trends in rainfall in China for the next decade. Combining these predictions and a random forest model will allow for the establishment of the potential disaster-prone areas from 2025 to 2035. The predictions reveal that the southern and south-eastern coastal China are to be concerned as high-risk areas. With the integration of heat maps and model results, a multi-faceted analysis gives out the important insights into the spatial distribution characteristics of disaster-prone areas in China and its implications with respect to disaster risk assessment, management, and responsive strategies.},

According to the specific needs of downhole displacement sensors, a multi-stage stepped secondary coil winding structure based on inductive displacement sensors is adopted, which significantly enhances the induced electromotive force of the secondary coils. By establishing a structural model of an inductive displacement sensor and using advanced finite element analysis software, we performed a detailed simulation analysis of the model. The analysis results show that there is an approximate linear relationship between the output voltage signal of the sensor and the different valve openings. The use of a multi-segment stepped secondary coil structure significantly increases the sensitivity of the sensor. Based on the above research results, we have successfully realized the continuous measurement of the valve opening of the downhole casing, which provides staunch support for the accurate monitoring and regulation of the downhole flow control system.},

Despite the large number of papers and reviews discussing data quality and benchmarking of trackers, none of them is addressing the trade-off between power consumption, speed and accuracy. Power dissipation is typically dominated by signal processing to extract gaze information from sensors embedded in the glasses. This compromise is crucial for smart glasses, powered by miniature batteries, offering a typical power budget of a few tens of mW for ET. Here we propose a simple benchmarking flow for wearable trackers, focused on power consumption, as well as accuracy, precision and sampling rate, and based on three complementary test setups. We report the preliminary results of the experimental characterization of 6 commercial trackers in the first static setup and we show a comparison of their performance based on a single figure of merit.},

Meanwhile, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has the potential to transform user experiences through personalization and adaptive interactions. The integration of these technologies offers a novel opportunity to refine GenAI models by leveraging human gaze data in adaptive interfaces, personalized content generation, and human-computer interaction. However, gaze data is highly sensitive and can reveal several user attributes, such as cognitive states, emotions, and even medical conditions. Therefore, the use of gaze data to inform GenAI models raises significant privacy concerns. Hence, in this paper, we highlight the implications of using eye gaze information in GenAI models with privacy and societal considerations and discuss strategies to mitigate potential privacy violations.

However, as these monitoring data accumulate to large scales, traditional relational databases can face serious performance bottlenecks, such as high latency when writing data from multiple sensors and inefficient data retrieval. These problems can significantly hinder the analysis of the risk-monitoring data. To address these issues, we propose a software architecture for a data management platform geared towards large-scale risk-monitoring data for cultural heritage sites. The architecture includes a data bus layer, computing engine layer, data management and storage layer, data analysis and visualization layer, and a cluster management and high-availability services layer. The function of each layer is described, as well as the strategy for data persistence and key business pipelines. Next as a practical test, we use open source software to build a pilot risk-monitoring data management system for the Mogao Grottoes, a world heritage site in Gansu, China. We select the system’s parameters based on performance comparisons and then demonstrate the implementation of its functions such as sensor data integration, risk alerts, and business data interpretation. The results show that the architecture can handle high-volume concurrent data insertion, large-scale data management, and long-term historical data operations. This proposed architecture can serve as a reference for those constructing risk-monitoring data management platforms for other cultural heritage sites and museums.},

abstract = {Smart glasses, including audio, augmented reality, and auto focal glasses, are emerging as a new class of wearables, designed to enhance user interaction with surroundings. Despite their potential, smart glasses suffer from limited natural interaction methods. Gaze tracking offers a promising solution, allowing users to interact with the device and their surroundings using their eyes. However, current video oculography (VOG) systems face challenges such as high-power consumption, bulky sensors, and reduced robustness in varying lighting conditions.To address these issues, we propose Laser Feedback Interferometry (LFI) sensors as an alternative to VOG. LFI sensors offer advantages in size, power efficiency, and ambient light robustness. The proposed LFI eye-tracking sensor integrates seamlessly into lightweight eye wear, requiring no user-specific calibration and enabling continuous, all-day use. To ensure reliable tracking across a wide range of users with varying interpupillary distances, we employ elongated laser beams that cover a broader eye region. This design enhances tracking precision by accurately capturing the user's gaze vector while maintaining robustness under different lighting conditions. We developed a comprehensive simulation model that integrates the sensor and eye model, validated against real-world experiments, and designed a convolutional neural network (CNN) based model to accurately estimate gaze from LFI sensor readings. Our results demonstrate that the LFI-based system provides a robust, efficient, and user-friendly gaze interaction solution, achieving high gaze prediction accuracy with an error margin of 2.23° on a custom simulation dataset. This represents a significant step toward next-generation smart glasses.},

Recently, researchers have explored ways to bridge these, seemingly, disparate disciplines. Much of this prior research centers on the proliferation of sports technologies that support individualistic learning experiences. Additionally, many of these experiences are developed by researchers with limited design contributions from sports practitioners. To extend prior work, this project centers youth athletic identities and the associated cultural contexts of sports to explore ways that computing technologies can enhance and develop youth athletic identities and sports performance. Moreover, this work surfaces ways that athletics can be a generative and fulfilling space to learn about CS.Participants. In summer 2021, we collaborated with basketball coaches to design and implement a computing-enhanced learning experience with a basketball team of Hispanic participants in Puerto Rico. Eleven basketball athletes from a high school in southern Puerto Rico participated in the study. The participants have strong sports identities, as demonstrated by their lifelong engagement with team sports. Conversely, only one 1 of the 11 participants had experienced sports technologies, and none of them had previously participated in computing learning experiences.Study Method. In collaboration with local basketball coaches, we co-designed a learning experience that centers sports identities and practices and adds computing as a way to extend existing sports identities and local sports activities. We present and evaluate this learning experience using a design-based research approach. Participants’ feedback was collected in the form of surveys, designs, and journal entries, and additional data on their experiences were collected via videos and researchers’ field notes. Using a mixed-methods approach, we highlight existing participants’ identities and perceptions as well as their experiences with our design. We complement quantitative analysis of survey responses with case studies.Findings. We find that our design can provide shifts in youth student-athletes’ perceptions of computing. Additionally, hands-on experiences with computing tools enable participants to start practicing CS sensemaking via learning how different computing tools can support their sports performance individually and as a team. Furthermore, we find that the material, ideational, and relational resources made available through camp:bit supported each participant differently, while collectively providing a space for all of them to have meaningful and fulfilling experiences. Finally, we find that this design can foster and support sports team cohesion.Conclusions. We provide in-depth descriptions of our design, the youth’s engagement with it, and how these learning experiences can be further applied in sports spaces. These examples highlight a unique conception of practice-linked computational identities—where learners’ computational identities are grounded in a specific culturally relevant practice, enabling a more culturally sustaining computing learning experience. Finally, our analysis suggests five design principles for designing and conducting computing-supported learning experiences in sports environments. The principles are as follows: (1) Sports Experience: Authentically Support Existing Identities. (2) Team Dynamics: Team Athletes Are Part of a Whole. (3) Individual Pursuits: Supporting Individual Paths. (4) Direct Interactions: Conversations with Materials and Ideas. (5) Interdisciplinary Facilitation Team: Complementary Skills. These design principles can be used by researchers, practitioners, and local stakeholders to implement sport-centric CS learning experiences to extend and enhance the way student-athletes from marginalized communities practice sports, as well as to activate interest and engagement in CS.},

abstract = {People living with dementia (PwD) in residential care settings often exhibit responsive behaviors, with agitation being the most common behavior. Automated systems to detect agitation events have the potential to improve patient care by helping to track symptoms and their response to interventions. We conducted a study from 2017 to 2019 in which we collected a novel multi-modal sensor dataset from 20 PwD living in a dementia care unit. Each participant wore an Empatica E4 watch for a maximum period of up to 60 days, leading to a large dataset worth 600 days. This wearable device collects raw acceleration, blood volume pulse, electro-dermal activity, and skin temperature data. The data are annotated with the start and end times of agitation events. Our previous analyses have shown that agitation behavior can be detected with a high area under receiver operating characteristic curve. We are now releasing this novel dataset for the research community to advance research in the field. In this article, we describe the study details, protocol used for annotation, improved agitation labelling, signal processing steps, and feature extraction approach. We present a new baseline on this dataset that can fuel new research in this important area of research.},

abstract = {In the realm of connected autonomous vehicles, the integration of data from both onboard and edge sensors is vital for environmental perception and navigation. However, the fusion of this sensor data faces challenges due to timestamp disparities, particularly when edge devices are involved. The Robotic Operating System (ROS) addresses this with synchronization policies like Approximate and Exact Time, along with the newer Synchronizing the Earliest Arrival Messages (SEAM). Understanding SEAM’s performance in edge-assisted environments is crucial yet under-explored. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of SEAM synchronization within ROS. Our study focuses on critical latency metrics for ROS message synchronization in edge-assisted autonomous driving. Specifically, we analyze two key latency metrics, the passing latency and reaction latency, which are needed to analyze the end-to-end delay and reaction time on the system level. We conduct experiments under different settings to evaluate the precision of our proposed latency upper bounds against the maximum experimental latency in simulation.},

abstract = {The residential energy sector plays a vital role in global environmental impact. In this domain, Internet of Things (IoT) systems are widely used for energy conservation and management. A key aspect of improving energy efficiency is establishing room occupancy ground truth for further analysis and modeling. Passive infrared (PIR) sensors are favored methods to detect occupancy for their simplicity and non-invasiveness. However, they often exhibit limited accuracy. The lack of reliable occupancy ground truth complicates subsequent work in optimizing building management.Hence, this research aims to develop a reliable method for mapping PIR sensor data to occupancy status. In this way, we addressed a key challenge by building a non-invasive occupancy detection solution. To this end, our project collected a data set in 10 houses over two months. We also used a public dataset in this paper for comparison and transfer learning. By developing models that combine PIR sensor data with environmental factors such as humidity, CO2 levels, and temperature, this research demonstrates the feasibility of accurately inferring room occupancy without direct observational data. Therefore, this paper contributes by developing methods to map PIR sensor data to occupancy reliably. Based on the modeling approach taken, transformer methods achieve better metrics than other methods and demonstrate transferability. Our code and dataset are available at GitHub Repository.},

abstract = {Loneliness is a critical public health issue, linked to increased morbidity and cognitive decline. While previous studies have explored loneliness detection using smartphones and wearables, they often rely on phone calls, SMS, and app usage, which may not fully capture loneliness's complexity. Others focus on limited physiological signals, but both approaches raise privacy concerns. In this paper, we introduce LonelyTracker, a privacy-aware device designed to detect loneliness through continuous monitoring of physiological signals and daily activity patterns. Our system integrates wearable data, such as heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA), and mobility data from IMU sensors, to develop a comprehensive loneliness detection model. We use a deep neural network (DNN) with a split computing framework to ensure data privacy, processing sensor data locally and sending anonymized feature representations to the cloud for model training. Our 10-week study with 20 participants shows that combining multimodal data improves accuracy, achieving results between 81.1\% and 96.5\%. Furthermore, LonelyTracker outperforms smartphone-based solutions in energy efficiency and real-time performance, demonstrating its potential for improved mental health monitoring.},

In addition to the sensor data transmission to a cloud server node for late processing, a semi-decentralized self-adaptation architecture with feedback control components running on edge nodes (gateways) is adopted to monitor the end devices and make decisions in the edge. The proposed control architecture was implemented as part of SEIROB, an IoT-Edge-Cloud exemplar for air quality monitoring, using the Python programming language and the open-source ChirpStack LoRaWAN network server stack. In this paper, we share the architecture design of SEIROB, report our experiments about its effectiveness in achieving some robustness scenarios, and discuss faced challenges and lessons learned in using a ready-to-use IoT infrastructure (like the ChirpStack platform) for ECC.},

abstract = {Many IoT applications rely on the timely collection and processing of data. Although the technology that allows data collection is readily available, its deployment on a large scale raises many practical issues, the main one probably being: who pays for the infrastructure? IoT deployment could significantly benefit from crowdsourcing: to ensure the successful deployment of a data collection infrastructure, it is crucial to motivate end users, as their active participation and engagement are key to the system's effectiveness and reach. This paper addresses these issues in a practical use case that deals with collecting environmental data. We propose a decentralized crowdsensing architecture where vehicles act as data collectors and transfer data from sources (e.g., sensing devices) to networked access points. The system provides economic incentives to individuals willing to act as data collectors or to operate gateways in the form of micropayments enabled by a blockchain. The proposed architecture is evaluated using a multilevel simulation model that combines existing communication, mobility, and behavioral sub-models. This reduces the time required to build a full simulator and potentially increases the accuracy of the results.},

abstract = {The extensive integration of Internet of Things (IoT) devices within various critical industrial and non-industrial environments accentuates the indispensable significance of authentication mechanisms in safeguarding applications against. Authentication protocols that do not rely on storing keys, which are susceptible to theft, leverage mechanisms based on Physical Unclonable Function (PUF), exploiting the unique characteristics of the device to generate keys. Modern implementations of PUFs employ cryptographic tools known as Fuzzy Extractors to mitigate inherent variability and noise. However, the adoption of this component presents various challenges and constraints, including the potential extraction of sensitive data, vulnerabilities in implementation and computational overhead. This study introduces a novel framework for devising authentication mechanisms utilizing any kind of PUFs for resource-constrained devices without necessitating a Fuzzy Extractor. The effectiveness of these security mechanisms depends on the attacker's uncertainty in guessing the correct response to each challenge compared to that of the authentic device. Additionally, we propose an implementation of the framework using SRAM-PUF, which achieves a security level comparable to guessing a 128-bit key. By avoiding the use of a fuzzy extractor, the proposed authentication framework aims to mitigate data leakage issues, modelling attacks and achieve a lighter scheme compared to the state of the art.},

However, there are few complete navigation solutions based on ROS2 and LiDAR, and industrial robots also tend to face more complex situations, including multi-scene adaptation and environmental change issues. Therefore this article designs and debugs a complete navigation scheme for mobile robot multi-scene adaptation based on inverted mounted LiDAR with ROS2. Conduct multiple manual navigation experiments in test environments with varying spatial complexity and temporal uncertainty to plan basic navigation routes.

abstract = {Wearable and implantable medical devices (IMDs) are increasingly deployed to diagnose, monitor, and provide therapy for critical medical conditions. Such medical devices are safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs). These systems support wireless features introducing potential security vulnerabilities. Although these devices undergo rigorous safety certification processes, runtime security attacks are inevitable. Based on published literature, IMDs such as pacemakers and insulin infusion systems can be remotely controlled to inject deadly electric shocks and excess insulin, posing a threat to a patient’s life. While prior works based on formal methods have been proposed to detect potential attack vectors using different forms of static analysis, these have limitations in preventing attacks at runtime.This article discusses a formal framework for detecting cyber-physical attacks on a pacemaker by monitoring its security policies at runtime. We propose a wearable device that senses the electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) of the body to detect attacks in a pacemaker. To facilitate the design of this device, we map the security policies of a pacemaker w.r.t. ECG and PPG, paving the way for designing formal verification monitors for pacemakers for the first time using multiple physiological signals. The proposed monitoring framework allows the synthesis of parallel monitors from a given set of desired security policies, where all the monitors execute concurrently and generate an alarm to the user in the case of policy violation. Our implementation and the performance evaluation results demonstrate the technical feasibility of designing such a wearable device for attack detection in pacemakers. This device is separate from the pacemaker, ensuring no need for re-certification of pacemakers. Our approach is amenable to the application of security patches when new attack vectors are detected, making the approach ideal for runtime monitoring of medical CPSs.},

abstract = {Background: Arsenic is a common environmental pollutant and its harmful effects on human health have been confirmed in several studies. However, the exact relationship between blood arsenic levels and heart valve disease remains controversial. Although some studies suggest that arsenic exposure may increase the risk of heart valve disease, there is a lack of sufficient evidence to clarify the mechanism and strength of this association. Methods: In the present study we performed a Mendelian randomization study with R using the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) database of blood arsenic levels and heart valve disease from East Asian samples. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was used to assess the primary outcomes, and MR Egger, Weighted median, and Weighted mode(WME) analyses were used to ensure the robustness of the results. Sensitivity analyses were performed using MR-Egger, WME, and MR polytomous residuals and outliers (MR-PRESSO) techniques. Finally, co-localization was used to identify the most significant SNPs in this study. Results: MR showed a genetic correlation between elevated blood arsenic levels and the development of heart valve disease (OR: 1.39, 95\% CI: 1.10-1.75, P: 5.58\texttimes{}10-3). GWAS co-localization results showed a common genetic factor between the two (PP.H1 =0.78) and a significant SNP: rs76256391. Sensitivity analyses showed no evidence of heterogeneity or pleiotropy in the reported results. Moreover, the inverse MR analysis found no correlation between the two Conclusions: These results show the stability of the study's findings that elevated levels of arsenic in the blood increase the risk of heart valve disease},

abstract = {Heart disease is one of the major global health threats, and early diagnosis is crucial for treatment and prevention. Heart sound signals are important indicators for evaluating the health status of the heart, and heart disease classification research is based on heart sound signals. This article proposes a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) model based on multi feature fusion and attention mechanism for automatic classification of heart sound signals. This model integrates three features: Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), comprehensively capturing the time-frequency characteristics of heart sound signals. In addition, the channel attention mechanism in the model improves the efficiency and robustness of feature extraction. The experimental results showed that the model achieved a classification accuracy of 99.67\% on five types of heart sound signal databases (1 normal and 4 abnormal), with a sensitivity and specificity of approximately 1. Due to its low computational requirements, this model is suitable for real-time deployment in resource limited environments such as portable devices or mobile applications, providing an effective and feasible method for automatic analysis of heart sound signals and early diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases.},

abstract = {Trusting software systems, particularly autonomous ones, is challenging. To address this, formal verification techniques can ensure these systems behave as expected. Runtime Verification (RV) is a leading, lightweight method for verifying system behaviour during execution. However, traditional RV assumes perfect information, meaning the monitoring component perceives everything accurately. This assumption often fails, especially with autonomous systems operating in real-world environments where sensors might be faulty. Additionally, traditional RV considers the monitor to be passive, lacking the capability to interpret the system's information and thus unable to address incomplete data. In this work, we extend standard RV of Linear Temporal Logic properties to accommodate scenarios where the monitor has imperfect information and behaves rationally. We outline the necessary engineering steps to update the verification pipeline and demonstrate our implementation in a case study involving robotic systems.},

abstract = {With the core objective of exploring the effects of basketball-related healthy physical training on students' cardiorespiratory health, this study utilizes systematic review and meta-analysis to delve deeper into the connection between basketball and students' cardiorespiratory fitness enhancement. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to explore the effects of basketball-related physical training on students' cardiorespiratory health. Six major databases, including Scoops, Web of science, EBSCO, PubMed, China Knowledge Network (CNKI) and Wanfang, were searched for evaluation and analysis. The search was restricted to Chinese and English, and the publication period was from 2006 to 2024. Fourteen eligible studies were finally included, with a total of 881 students participating, of which the number of students in the experimental group was 442 and the number of students in the control group was 439. Continuous variables were expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95\% confidence interval (CI), and the results were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis, the quality of the literature was assessed by the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, publication bias was examined by applying funnel plots, and meta-analysis and subgroup analyses were performed by using the Review Manager 5.4 software, and sensitivity analyses were carried out to assess the results The results of this systematic evaluation and meta-analysis showed that basketball had a significant positive effect on students' cardiorespiratory fitness, enhanced lung capacity and respiratory muscle function, and significantly improved students' cardiorespiratory fitness. It provides a scientific basis for schools and educational institutions to encourage students to participate in basketball, and promotes the overall development of students' physical and mental health.},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) allows players to experience and explore a variety of virtual environments together or alone. The appeal of many VR games lies in the high sense of immersion provided by current head-mounted displays (HMDs). While this allows players to fully focus on the game, it also isolates them from their physical surroundings. This visual detachment can lead to disorientation and may result in the fear of colliding with a real-world object or person.In our study (N = 62), we investigated, whether the fear of colliding with another player in a co-located multiplayer VR game affects the subjective experience, player behavior, and social processes during gameplay. For this, we compared a co-located (both players in one room) and remote (each player in a separate room) variant of the cooperative VR escape game we developed.The results suggest that players who share their real-world play area experience significantly higher interpersonal collision anxiety, keep greater distance from their teammate, feel more restricted in their freedom of movement, and try to consciously avoid physical contact. Associated findings of lower team involvement and perceived team cohesion highlight the need to further investigate the impact fear of collision has on co-located VR multiplayer.},

abstract = {Purpose: The feet are the cornerstone that supports the structure of the human body and is vital to human health in daily life. Walking exercise can improve human health and promote socialist builders and successors through comprehensive development of morals, intelligence, physical fitness, aesthetics and work skills. However, the flat feet group may encounter many related problems during long-term walking, such as: B. Plantar fasciitis, toe bone pain and knee joint pain. This study examined whether Arch Support Insoles (ASIs) compared to Flat Insoles (FIs) can reduce muscle fatigue in the lower limbs of flatfoot groups during walking and examined a new method for detecting the sensitivity of electromyographic spectrum intervals in diagnosing lower neuromuscular symptoms Limbs from the perspective of sports biomechanics. Method: A total of 15 female students with flat feet were recruited for this study and deemed eligible to participate. Each participant met the inclusion criteria of Chippoux-Smirak index &gt;45\%. Analyzed electromyography of the rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris (BF), gastrocnemius (GAS), and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles during a 6-minute uphill walk. Use the paired sample t test to compare the differences in power spectrum ranges between ASIs and FIs in the subfrequency band intervals 20–50, 50–80, 80–110, 110–140 Hz. Results and Discussion: Within the frequency band interval of 20-140 Hz for the rectus femoris, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius muscles, PSA when wearing arched insoles was significantly lower than that of flat insoles (p = 0.009, p = 0.006). p=0.009), suggesting that wearing arch support insoles can effectively reduce fatigue of lower extremity muscle groups compared to flat insoles. In the rectus femoris, tibialis anterior, biceps femoris and gastrocnemius muscles, the coefficient of variation (CV) of curved insoles is lower than that of flat insoles. Conclusion and Suggestions: When walking uphill, wearing arched insoles can effectively reduce muscle fatigue in the lower limbs. In addition, it is recommended to use the 20-50Hz power spectral range detection method to detect muscle fatigue in the rectus femoris muscle, which has better sensitivity. To detect gastrocnemius muscle fatigue, power spectral range detection methods of 50–80 Hz or 80–110 Hz can be used to improve researchers' efficiency in processing electromyographic signals.},
