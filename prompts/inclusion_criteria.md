INC.3: Includes custom embedded system/device/artifact
  - Example: printed circuit board (PCB), breadboard, firmware, software, mechanical components (all or some of the above)
INC.4: artifact targets or is embedded, wireless, low-power, and performs sensing and/or actuation
  - Microprocessor-based
  - Roughly <=500mW peak operation (estimate)
  - Prototypes do not need to meet all criteria, but must be envisioned to meet them in a final state.
INC.5: Designed for in-situ deployment
INC.6: Health or Ecology domain
  - broadly applied and can be an adjacent application
INC.7: Target specificity
  - specific population or specific environmental context
INC.8: Evaluates embedded artifacts.
  - examples: user-study, control study, benchmarking, benchtop
