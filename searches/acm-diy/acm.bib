abstract = {The advancement of Vision-Language Model (VLM) camera sensors, which enable autonomous understanding of household situations without user intervention, has the potential to completely transform the DIY smart home building experience. Will this simplify or complicate the DIY smart home process? Additionally, what features do users want to create using these sensors? To explore this, we conducted a three-week diary-based experience prototyping study with 12 participants. Participants recorded their daily activities, used GPT to analyze the images, and manually customized and tested smart home features based on the analysis. The study revealed three key findings: (1) participants’ expectations for VLM camera-based smart homes, (2) the impact of VLM camera sensor characteristics on the DIY process, and (3) users’ concerns. Through the findings of this study, we propose design implications to support the DIY smart home building process with VLM camera sensors, and discuss living with intelligence.},

abstract = {Existing commercial and in-house software development tools are often inaccessible to blind and low vision software professionals (BLVSPs), hindering their participation and career growth at work. Building on existing research on Do-It-Yourself (DIY) assistive technologies and customized tools made by programmers, we shed light on the currently unexplored intersection of how DIY tools built and used by BLVSPs support accessible software development. Through semi-structured interviews with 30 BLVSPs, we found that such tools serve many different purposes and are driven by motivations such as desiring to maintain a professional image and a sense of dignity at work. These tools had significant impacts on workplace accessibility and revealed a need for a more centralized community for sharing tools, tips, and tricks. Based on our findings, we introduce the “Double Hacker Dilemma” and highlight a need for developing more effective peer and organizational platforms that support DIY tool sharing.},

abstract = {Feminist research highlights the urgent need to challenge the oppressive design of commercial intimate technologies, particularly how the FemTech industry restricts access to intimate bodily knowledge through paywalls and proprietary systems. Yet, for decades, women and marginalized communities have turned to Do-It-Yourself (DIY) or ‘hacking’ practices to reclaim control over their own gynecology and intimate health, addressing gaps often ignored by medical research and healthcare. Inspired by visual themes from these movements, this pictorial critically explores how designers and HCI researchers might advance DIY approaches to intimate technologies. We exemplify this with reflections from a series of workshops on handmade intimate sensors, and draw out the joyful potential of collaborative making—building alliances, destigmatizing intimate health, and using craft to subvert gender stereotypes. We discuss matters of safety when making together and contribute to ongoing work on building feminist makerspaces.},

Specifically, effective sensing of home situations is crucial for building these features, and several studies have explored the use of cameras as home sensors to capture more specific scenarios. Camera sensors offer the potential to use various elements based on visual information as sensing triggers, presenting possibilities distinct from commonly used IoT sensors. These unique characteristics may necessitate new support for the DIY smart home-building process. In light of this, our doctoral research aims to (1) understand the unique user experience of camera sensors in DIY smart home building, (2) explore the potential and challenges of using cameras as sensors, and (3) propose a design framework for a toolkit that supports the camera sensor-driven DIY smart home building experience. This doctoral colloquium paper discusses our research plans, which synthesize knowledge on toolkit design to support the effective use of camera sensors in building DIY smart home features.},

This research investigates novel user experiences while constructing DIY smart home features using an ML-intensive camera sensor in contrast to commonly used IoT sensors. Thus, we conducted a seven-day field diary study with 12 families who were given a DIY smart home kit.

abstract = {Paper-based interactive RF devices have opened new possibilities for wireless sensing, yet they are typically constrained by short operational ranges. This paper introduces RadioGami, a method for creating long-range, batteryless RF sensing surfaces on paper using low-cost, DIY materials like copper tape, paper, and off-the-shelf electronics paired with an affordable radio receiver (approx. $20). We explore the design space enabled by RadioGami, including sensing paper deformations like bending, tearing, and origami patterns (Miura, Kresling) at ranges up to 45.73 meters. RadioGami employs a novel ultra-low power (35μW) switching circuit with a tunnel diode for wireless functionality. These surfaces can sustainably operate by harvesting energy using tiny photodiodes. We demonstrate applications that monitor object status, track user interactions (rotation, sliding), and detect environmental changes. We characterize performance, sensitivity, range, and power consumption with deployment studies. RadioGami advances sustainable, tangible, and batteryless interfaces for embodied interaction.},

abstract = {We present BioTube, a sustainable and highly accessible DIY fabrication approach for creating hollow tubular alginate, and demonstrate its potential for making biodegradable transient devices. This technique involves extruding alginate into a calcium solution, initiating a progressive crosslinking process that starts from the outer shell and progresses inward. This controlled process removes the uncrosslinked core before complete gelation, yielding hollow alginate fibers. To further enhance the capabilities of BioTube, we explored three further crosslinking strategies to customize the fiber shape, local cross-sectional geometry, and stiffness. The versatility of this method is demonstrated through three key functional primitives: shape, morphing, and sensing. These capabilities are further illustrated through five application examples, including transient wearables, edible shape-changing interfaces, experimental gastronomy, underwater grippers, and sacrificial casting molds. We believe that BioTube will expand the design possibilities for alginate, enabling the creation of innovative biodegradable devices.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been a surge of interest in sustainable energy sources, particularly for wearable computing. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have shown promise in converting human motion into electric power. Textile-based TENGs, valued for their flexibility and breathability, offer an ideal form factor for wearables. However, uptake in maker communities has been slow due to commercially unavailable materials, complex fabrication processes, and structures incompatible with human motion. This paper introduces texTENG, a textile-based framework simplifying the fabrication of power harvesting and self-powered sensing applications. By leveraging accessible materials and familiar tools, texTENG bridges the gap between advanced TENG research and wearable applications. We explore a design menu for creating multidimensional TENG structures using braiding, weaving, and knitting. Technical evaluations and example applications highlight the performance and feasibility of these designs, offering DIY-friendly pathways for fabricating textile-based TENGs and promoting sustainable prototyping practices within the HCI and maker communities.},

abstract = {Socially assistive robots (SARs) can act as caregivers and use touch gestures to interact with people such as children with autism. However, designing a touch perception system that can reliably detect these gestures remains a challenge. To address this gap, we replicated a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) skin-like sensor and evaluated its potential to identify eight social touch gestures: Fistbump, Hitting, Holding, Poking, Squeezing, Stroking, Tapping, and Tickling. Our sensor design builds on a recent silicone-based sensor to collect spatiotemporal gesture data and a load cell to capture force information. We collected touch gestures from 20 adults in a user study. Then, we built a touch perception algorithm with a Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model, achieving 94\% in gesture classification accuracy with 10-fold validation and 69\% accuracy with subject-dependent splitting with the combined touch and force data.},

abstract = {Feline urine provides valuable information on an animal’s well-being, but professional veterinary collection and analysis of urine samples can be intrusive, costly, and infrequent. Electrochemical biosensors recognize biological elements such as pH, glucose and sodium, and have numerous applications, including in medical diagnosis, environmental monitoring, food quality control and drug discovery. This paper presents cirCAT: PURRtentio, a litter box system that uses a electrochemical biosensor to monitor analytes in feline urine. We provide the implementation process of the system that consists of a DIY three-electrode biosensor, a potentiostat, a microcontroller, a ToF sensor and a mobile application. A rinsing mechanism is also included to extend the lifespan of the sensors. The system was tested using three separate electrochemistry tests to ensure accuracy, reliability, and applicability. We prepared and compared electrochemical biosensors with different conductive materials for Do-It-Yourself (DIY) electrodes. The second test compared PURRtentio against an industry-grade potentiostat. The third test compared our system against current veterinary standards for chemical analysis using feline’s urine samples. Additionally, we conducted a case study with a cat using PURRtentio for 72 hours. Finally, with results from these research and another series of interviews we did with veterinarian experts, we provide implications and future directions of this technology. PURRtentio presents an innovative and non-invasive means to consistently monitor chemistry elements in feline urine, potentially allowing for early detection and management of cat’s health conditions.},

Their self-produced bioplastics possess compelling properties such as self-adhesion but have so far not been functionalized to create soft interactive devices, due to a lack of DIY techniques for the fabrication of functional electronic circuits and sensors. In this paper, we contribute a DIY approach for creating Interactive Bioplastics that is accessible to a wide audience, making use of easy-to-obtain bio-based raw materials and familiar tools. We present three types of conductive bioplastic materials and their formulation: sheets, pastes and foams. Our materials enable additive and subtractive fabrication of soft circuits and sensors. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these materials can substitute conventional prototyping materials, be combined with off-the-shelf electronics, and be fed into a sustainable material ‘life-cycle’ including disassembly, re-use, and re-melting of materials. A formal characterization of our conductors highlights that they are even on-par with commercially available carbon-based conductive pastes.},

We then embedded sensors and LEDs within the SCOBY to create a wearable that visually signals based on touch interactions.

abstract = {Due to its natural warmth, wood is frequently used to produce touchable objects such as furniture and signboards. Laser cutting machines are becoming common in personal wood processing to cut and engrave wood. In this paper, we propose a method and workflow for producing various sensors and electrical circuits for interactive devices by partially carbonizing the wood surface with a laser cutting machine. Similar to wiring on a conventional printed circuit board (PCB), the carbonized part functions as a conductive electrical path. A method for creating electronic circuits and sensors made of carbon graphene on botanical materials has been proposed. This technique makes use of a raster-scanning femtosecond (fs) laser, which is less common for personal fabrication than a constant-wave (CW) laser. Moreover, raster-scanning requires a substantial amount of time to create a circuit that is mainly made of conductive lines. This paper extends the method with a defocused vector-scanning CW laser beam and reduces the time and cost required for fabrication. The proposed method uses an affordable CW laser cutter to fabricate an electrical circuit, including touch sensors, damage sensors, and load sensors on wood boards. The circuit can be easily connected to traditional PCBs and electric parts such as one-board microcomputers using metal screws and nails typically used in DIY woodworking. We develop ease of use software design tool that supports the creation and fabrication of carbon paths. In addition, we report on a series of investigations, including optimizing wood materials and laser parameters to establish design guidelines.},
