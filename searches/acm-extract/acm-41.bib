abstract = {WiFi-based contactless sensing has found numerous applications in the fields of smart home and health care owning to its low-cost, non-intrusive and privacy-preserving characteristics. While promising in many aspects, the limited sensing range and interference issues still exist, hindering the adoption of WiFi sensing in real world. In this paper, inspired by the SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) metric in communication theory, we propose a new metric named SSNR (sensing-signal-to-noise-ratio) to quantify the sensing capability of WiFi systems. We theoretically model the effect of transmitter-receiver distance on sensing coverage. We show that in LoS scenario, the sensing coverage area increases first from a small oval to a maximal one and then decreases. When the transmitter-receiver distance further increases, the coverage area is separated into two ovals located around the two transceivers respectively. We demonstrate that, instead of applying complex signal processing scheme or advanced hardware, by just properly placing the transmitter and receiver, the two well-known issues in WiFi sensing (i.e., small range and severe interference) can be greatly mitigated. Specifically, by properly placing the transmitter and receiver, the coverage of human walking sensing can be expanded by around 200\%. By increasing the transmitter-receiver distance, a target's fine-grained respiration can still be accurately sensed with one interferer sitting just 0.5 m away.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a multiple concurrent occupant identification approach through footstep-induced floor vibration sensing. Identification of human occupants is useful in a variety of indoor smart structure scenarios, with applications in building security, space allocation, and healthcare. Existing approaches leverage sensing modalities such as vision, acoustic, RF, and wearables, but are limited due to deployment constraints such as line-of-sight requirements, sensitivity to noise, dense sensor deployment, and requiring each walker to wear/carry a device. To overcome these restrictions, we use footstep-induced structural vibration sensing. Footstep-induced signals contain information about the occupants' unique gait characteristics, and propagate through the structural medium, which enables sparse and passive identification of indoor occupants. The primary research challenge is that multiple-person footstep-induced vibration responses are a mixture of structurally-codependent overlapping individual responses with unknown timing, spectral content, and mixing ratios. As such, it is difficult to determine which part of the signal corresponds to each occupant. We overcome this challenge through a recursive sparse representation approach based on cosine distance that identifies each occupant in a footstep event in the order that their signals are generated, reconstructs their portion of the signal, and removes it from the mixed response. By leveraging sparse representation, our approach can simultaneously identify and separate mixed/overlapping responses, and the use of the cosine distance error function reduces the influence of structural codependency on the multiple walkers' signals. In this way, we isolate and identify each of the multiple occupants' footstep responses. We evaluate our approach by conducting real-world walking experiments with three concurrent walkers and achieve an average F1 score for identifying all persons of 0.89 (1.3x baseline improvement), and with a 10-person "hybrid" dataset (simulated combination of single-walker real-world data), we identify 2, 3, and 4 concurrent walkers with a trace-level accuracy of 100\%, 93\%, and 73\%, respectively, and observe as much as a 2.9x error reduction over a naive baseline approach.},

abstract = {Smartwatches or fitness trackers have garnered a lot of popularity as potential health tracking devices due to their affordable and longitudinal monitoring capabilities. To further widen their health tracking capabilities, in recent years researchers have started to look into the possibility of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) detection in real-time leveraging photoplethysmography (PPG) data, an inexpensive sensor widely available in almost all smartwatches. A significant challenge in AF detection from PPG signals comes from the inherent noise in the smartwatch PPG signals. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning based approach, BayesBeat that leverages the power of Bayesian deep learning to accurately infer AF risks from noisy PPG signals, and at the same time provides an uncertainty estimate of the prediction. Extensive experiments on two publicly available dataset reveal that our proposed method BayesBeat outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, BayesBeat is substantially more efficient having 40--200X fewer parameters than state-of-the-art baseline approaches making it suitable for deployment in resource constrained wearable devices.},

abstract = {Camera-based contactless photoplethysmography refers to a set of popular techniques for contactless physiological measurement. The current state-of-the-art neural models are typically trained in a supervised manner using videos accompanied by gold standard physiological measurements. However, they often generalize poorly out-of-domain examples (i.e., videos that are unlike those in the training set). Personalizing models can help improve model generalizability, but many personalization techniques still require some gold standard data. To help alleviate this dependency, in this paper, we present a novel mobile sensing system called MobilePhys, the first mobile personalized remote physiological sensing system, that leverages both front and rear cameras on a smartphone to generate high-quality self-supervised labels for training personalized contactless camera-based PPG models. To evaluate the robustness of MobilePhys, we conducted a user study with 39 participants who completed a set of tasks under different mobile devices, lighting conditions/intensities, motion tasks, and skin types. Our results show that MobilePhys significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on-device supervised training and few-shot adaptation methods. Through extensive user studies, we further examine how does MobilePhys perform in complex real-world settings. We envision that calibrated or personalized camera-based contactless PPG models generated from our proposed dual-camera mobile sensing system will open the door for numerous future applications such as smart mirrors, fitness and mobile health applications.},

abstract = {Multimodal systems offer their functionalities through multiple communication channels. A messenger application may take either keyboard or voice input, and present incoming messages as text or audio output. This allows the users to communicate with their devices using the modality that best suits their context and personal preference. Authentication is often the first interaction with an application. The users’ login behavior can thus be used to immediately adapt the communication channel to their preferences. Yet given the sensitive nature of authentication, this interaction may not be representative for the user’s inclination to use speech input in non-critical routine tasks. In this paper, we test whether the interactions during authentication differ from non-critical routine tasks in a smart home application. Our findings indicate that, even in such a private space, the authentication behavior does not correlate with the use, nor with the perceived usability of speech input during non-critical task. We further find that short interactions with the system are not indicative of the user’s attitude towards audio output, independent of whether authentication or non-critical tasks are performed. Since security concerns are minmized in the secure environment of private spaces, our findings can be generalized to other contexts where security threats are even more apparent.},

Following Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) theory, but considering low affect and high affect students separately, we developed a system of five categories of video recommendations: 1) Watch new video; 2) Review current topic video with a new tutor; 3) Review segment of current video with current tutor; 4) Review segment of current video with a new tutor; 5) Watch next video in curriculum sequence. The category of recommendation was determined by student scores on a quiz and a sensor-free engagement detection model. New video recommendations (i.e., category 1) were selected based on a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that takes input from an item response theory model. The recommendation system was evaluated in a large field experiment, both before and after school closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show evidence of effectiveness of the video recommendation algorithm during the period of normal school operations, but the effect disappears after school closures. Implications for teacher orchestration of technology for normal classroom use and periods of school closure are discussed.},

abstract = {The application of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare is an emerging domain. In Healthcare applications, relying on both IoT and AI requires paying attention to latency, responsiveness and management of data loads. Most of the healthcare applications are based on Cloud computing and use Cloud platforms such as Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. With the increased adoption of IoT in various domains, the data generation rate and volume by IoT devices has tremendously increased, making the Cloud insufficient for latency sensitive healthcare applications. Fog computing, complementing the Cloud services, can be deployed close to the data source to better utilize distributed resources and meet the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of healthcare application. In this paper, we propose a Fog-based cardiac health detection framework, called FogDLearner. FogDLearner utilizes distributed resources to diagnose cardiac health of a person without compromising QoS and accuracy. FogDLearner uses a deep learning based classifier to predict the cardiac health of the user. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on the PureEdgeSim simulator, in terms of resource utilization under overload and under-load scenarios, mobility support, and power consumption. The experimental results show the validity of proposed work for support of mobile applications.},

abstract = {The rapid advances in fitness wearable devices are redefining privacy around interactions. Fitness wearables devices record a considerable amount of sensitive and private details about exercise, blood oxygen level, and heart rate. Privacy concerns have emerged about the interactions between an individual’s raw fitness data and data analysis by the providers of fitness apps and wearable devices. This paper describes the importance of adopting and applying legal frameworks within the fitness tracker ecosystem. In this review, we describe the studies on the current privacy policies of fitness app providers, heuristically evaluate the methods for consent management by fitness providers, summarize the gaps identified in our review of these studies, and discuss potential solutions for filling the gaps identified. We have identified four main problems related to preserving the privacy of users of fitness apps: lack of system transparency, lack of privacy policy legibility, concerns regarding one-time consent, and issues of noncompliance regarding consent management. After discussing feasible solutions, we conclude by describing how blockchain is suitable for solving these privacy issues.},

abstract = {While acoustic-based underwater communication systems have been widely used for many decades, existing systems still suffer from the low reliability problem due to the severe multipath fading, especially in shallow water environments. It is well known that MIMO and beamforming techniques are among the most effective solutions to address fading challenges. However, not all underwater devices can carry the multiple-transducer system due to cost and size limitations, especially small AUVs and sensors. In this paper, we design and characterize the novel acoustic intelligent surfaces in the underwater environment, which enables the beamforming capability to address the multipath fading problem, without requiring the end-users to equip MIMO components. To the best of our knowledge, although electromagnetic (EM) intelligent surfaces have been intensively investigated for terrestrial communications recently, acoustic intelligent surface has not been explored since it has completely different physical mechanism and hardware structure than that of EM surfaces. Therefore, in this paper, we design a new reconfigurable piezoelectric reflector array that performs as an underwater intelligent surface. Rigorous analytical model is developed to characterize how the designed underwater intelligent surface controls the propagation of acoustic waves in the underwater multipath channel. Based on the new design and model, the underwater intelligent surface-enabled beamforming protocol is provided. Through a hybrid underwater communication simulator based on COMSOL Multiphysics and Bellhop toolbox, we demonstrate the proposed acoustic intelligent surface can effectively form and steer acoustic beams and significantly mitigate the multipath fading in shallow underwater environments.},

abstract = {The use of ventilators has always been common in medical scenarios but very expensive to procure or develop. One of the main reasons for these is the components that are being used are expensive and require precise instrumentation, research and development. This paper attempts to mitigate that problem by proposing a novel way to rapidly develop a portable ventilator that uses common 3D printing technology and off-the-shelf components. This turbine and valve-based ventilator feature most of the modes that are commonly used by healthcare professionals. A unique servo-based pressure release mechanism has been designed that makes the system around 36 times more efficient than solenoid-based systems. Reliability and efficiency have been increased further through the use of a novel positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) valve that does not contain any electromechanical component. Effective algorithms such as feed-forward and proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controllers were used alongside the unique ‘Sensor data filtration methodology’. The system also provides an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) via an android application that can be installed on any readily found tabs while the firmware manages the breathing detection algorithm using a flow meter. This modular and portable ventilator also features a swappable battery and holds the ability to run on solar power. This energy-efficient and low noise system can run for 5 to 6 hours at a stretch without needing to be connected with the main's supply. This ventilator's design and development files have been certified by open-source hardware association (OSHWA): https://certification.oshwa.org/bd000001.html},

Compared with the traditional analog signal processing platform based on the digital signal processing simulation platform based on DSP and FPGA co-processing technology, the digital signal processing system not only has more advantages in terms of sensitivity and accuracy, but also has lower development cost and Wider application environment requirements. DSP multi-core board and DSP core, FPGA core signal receiving board and back-end circuit design have very important significance. The function of software design is to collect data from the FPGA board and transmit the data to the multi-core DSP through the PCIE bus. DSP and FPGA provide great help for the design of hardware installation. Pay special attention to the circuit design of multi-core DSP board with multi-core DSP, FPGA nuclear signal receiving board and backplane. The function that the software design realizes is FPGA board card gathers the data signal. This paper analyzes the relevant characteristics and theoretical knowledge of DSP and FPGA co-processing technology, transmits data to the multi-core DSP board through the PCIE bus, completes the relevant detection of multi-channel signals on the multi-core DSP board, and realizes the development of a digital signal processing simulation platform. The final result of the research shows that when the real running time is 1523ms, the virtual simulation time is 123ms. When the real running time increases, the virtual simulation time also increases, showing a proportional relationship. The virtual simulation time has a shorter and faster running time.},

abstract = {Progress in human development creates unwanted consequences in society. The public has been threatened with health issues that stem from the anthropogenic use of the environment. This is mainly the reason why the idea of a healthy city is an emerging topic. There must be a balance between having convenience and efficiency by affording health-supportive environments in the urban setting. The concept of active mobility is pushed for as it requires people to get exercise as a mode of transport. The mode of transport takes advantage of walking and cycling to get from one point to another. Between the two, the paper looks at cycling as it can reach farther distances and more locations with shorter periods.In looking at active transport as a necessity to navigate between locations, the destination is the important reason for travel. If cycling active mobility is to be further encouraged, a sense of inclusivity must be provided through bike parking. This paper investigated current bike parking patterns in social media. Data was crowdsourced from Instagram with the hashtag “bikeparking” - #bikeparking (n=440). This study suggests a framework behind the considerations of bike parking by looking at dimensions of the user (parking typology, human presence, and type of bike used), cycling infrastructure (count of bikes parked, built overhead protection, and bike parking load), and environmental settings (visible elements and time settings) viewed through what social media labelled as #bikeparking. The sampled images were processed through content analysis. The variables collected were analyzed by Chi-square tests to find relationships within the suggested framework.The data revealed that although there is a trend for cycling mobility, bike parking strategies in the landscape tend to vary based on the interactions between the variables of the user dimension to the other identified dimensions of cycling infrastructure and environmental settings. The contemporary patterns of bike parking elaborated in this paper provides an idea of ways wherein contributors of crowdsourced data find a scene they deem acceptable to be tagged as “#bikeparking.” In planning for more developments geared towards active mobility and health supportiveness, the landscape at the endpoints needs bike parking. Social media data through #bikeparking can contribute to this process through consideration of the framework interactions with security, demand, and environmental settings dimensions.},

In order to make the noise value of acoustic environment sensitive points along the expressway meet the corresponding requirements in the EIA report, based on genetic algorithm, through comparative analysis of building installation of sound insulation devices (such as sound insulation windows), setting sound barriers, planting green forest belts, adjusting the use function of buildings near the noise source or the noise reduction effect of demolition, It is determined to set metal composite plate sound barrier as the main noise reduction measure. Based on the design noise reduction index of the sound barrier, and considering a certain design margin and the correction of various sound propagation influencing factors, the height and length of the sound barrier at the sensitive points of the sound environment are determined.},

abstract = {In recent years, with the rapid development of my country's economy, super high-rise buildings(SHB) have continuously emerged in my country's urban construction. The structural safety issues caused by building quality and structural aging have greatly attracted the attention of the society. With the increasing maturity of sensor technology and the development of modal parameter identification methods for structural systems, structural health monitoring is increasingly applied to SHB and long-span bridges. Reinforced concrete(RC) is an important material for building frame structures. Monitoring and preventing the lateral displacement of RC can effectively avoid the existence of potential safety hazards. This article mainly adopts experimental analysis and data analysis methods to explore whether the RC of SHB undergoes lateral displacement, so as to locate the location of hidden dangers in time, and allow sufficient time for the preparation of specific response plans. This paper compares and analyzes the simulated measured value and the measured lateral displacement value for the monitoring points in different directions. According to the experimental research results, compared with the measured lateral displacement value, the simulated measured displacement value has a small difference.},

abstract = {With the application of high-end technology in the fields of face recognition, target tracking, autonomous driving, remote sensing image analysis, etc., leapfrog development has also been achieved, and the target recognition algorithms proposed in different fields have also shown that they can match human capabilities. What this article puts forward is the research of target recognition method in aerobics teaching activities based on machine algorithm and improved BP neural network algorithm. As a hotspot in the field of machine learning, deep learning algorithms have been widely introduced into remote sensing (Remote Sensing, RS) applications. The data generated by hundreds of remote sensing sensors every day and the dramatic increase in the amount of calculation that it brings and the complex surface environment Severely improve the efficiency and accuracy of computer data analysis algorithms. This article builds aerobics exercise type recognition data set. At the same time, in order to enable the BP neural network algorithm to further improve the recognition accuracy, based on the BP neural network recognition.

abstract = {With the continuous development of artificial intelligence technology, more and more automation technologies are combined with various machines. Automation technology has reached the driving field from the industrial revolution. Driverless technology has gradually become a major direction of the automobile market. The focus of driverless vehicles is the development of autonomous obstacle avoidance system. The perception system of driverless vehicles is responsible for sensing and interacting with the surrounding environment, usually including sensing information, data fusion, positioning and other functions. The reliability of machines is higher than that of people. In theory, automatic driving technology will be safer, and driverless vehicles have also proved this statistically. It can indeed make people's travel safer and reduce the probability of traffic accidents. Moreover, the autonomous obstacle avoidance system of driverless vehicle based on machine vision can greatly improve the overall traffic efficiency and greatly alleviate the traffic congestion. The experimental results show that the design of autonomous obstacle avoidance system for driverless vehicles based on machine vision reduces the road congestion rate by 8\%. Machine vision enhances the ability of unmanned vehicles to successfully complete trajectory planning and following tasks when driving on any road, and its algorithm needs good real-time performance and stable reliability. For the limitations of the research on driverless mode, the method of innovative combination is adopted to update and iterate the autonomous obstacle avoidance of driverless vehicles, and the path planning for local navigation of various vehicles is analyzed, discussed and summarized, so as to enrich the research results of vehicle automatic obstacle avoidance system.},

abstract = {Contact tracing in case of pandemic is becoming an essential mitigation tool for national health services to break infection chains and prevent the virus from spreading further. To support manual tracing, several countries have been developing contact tracing apps that detect nearby mobile phones using Bluetooth. Such data collection raised privacy concerns and several privacy-preserving protocols have been proposed to prevent the leakage of personal and sensitive information. These solutions are mainly divided into two categories using a centralized or a decentralized exposure score computation. However, both approaches depict limitations.This article presents Desire, a novel exposure notification system that leverages the best of centralized and decentralized systems. As opposed to existing contact tracing schemes, Desire leverages Private Encounter Tokens (Pets) generated locally on the device that uniquely identify an encounter between two nodes while being private and unlinkable by the server. The role of the server is merely to match PETs generated by diagnosed users with the pets provided by requesting users. Our privacy risk analysis shows that Desire drastically improves privacy against malicious users (i.e., limitation of decentralized systems) and authority (i.e., limitation of centralised systems). We implemented Desire, evaluated it in real condition, and show it feasibility.},

One of the biggest challenges facing the clinical trial research community is satisfying Part 11 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations [7] and ISO 27789 [40]. These controls provide audit requirements that guarantee the reliability of the data contained in the electronic records. Context-aware smart devices and wearable IoT devices have become increasingly common in clinical trials. Electronic Data Capture (EDC) and Clinical Data Management Systems (CDMS) do not currently address the new challenges introduced using these devices. The healthcare digital threat landscape is continually evolving, and the prevalence of sensor fusion and wearable devices compounds the growing attack surface. We propose Scrybe, a permissioned blockchain, to store proof of clinical trial data provenance. We illustrate how Scrybe addresses each control and the limitations of the Ethereum-based blockchains.

abstract = {In the second decade of this century, technical progress has led to a worldwide proliferation of devices for tracking the movement behavior of a person, a vehicle, or another kind of entity. One of the consequences of this development is a massive and still growing amount of movement and movement-related data recorded by cellphones, automobiles, vessels, aircraft, and further GPS-enabled entities. As a result, the requirements for managing and analyzing movement records also increase, serving commercial, administrative, or private purposes. Since the development of hardware components cannot keep pace with the data growth, exploring methods of analyzing such trajectory datasets has become a very active and influential research field.For many application scenarios, besides the spatial trajectory of an entity, it is desirable to take additional semantic information into consideration. These descriptions also change with time and may represent, e.g., the course of streets passed by a bus, the sequence of region names traversed by an aircraft, or the points of interest in proximity of the positions of a taxi. Such data may be directly recorded by a sensor (such as the altitude of an aircraft) or computed from the spatial trajectory combined with some underlying information (for example, street names). It is often helpful or even necessary to focus on such semantic information for efficient analyses, as changes usually occur less frequently than it is the case for the spatial trajectory, where data points usually arrive in very close temporal distances. However, any kind of querying requires a deep semantic knowledge of the dataset at hand, particularly for retrieving the set of trajectories that match a certain mobility pattern, that is, a sequence of temporal, spatial, and semantic specifications.In this article, we introduce a framework named MFPMiner1 for retrieving all mobility patterns fulfilling a user-specified frequency threshold from a spatio-textual trajectory dataset. The resulting patterns and their relative frequency can be regarded as a knowledge base of the considered data. They may be directly visualized or applied for a pattern matching query yielding the set of matching trajectories. We demonstrate the functionality of our approach in an application scenario and provide an experimental evaluation of its performance on real and synthetic datasets by comparing it to three competitive methods. The framework has been fully implemented in a DBMS environment and is freely available open source software.},

abstract = {Among the possible conversion processes for biomass is Anaerobic Digestion (AD) that produces a valuable energy known as biogas. However, the instability of biogas production is challenging due to the complex process of the AD that requires a precise environmental conditions as well as different bacteria populations. Hence, monitoring and controlling these conditions and tracking the bacteria behaviour inside the digester is the way to overcame this challenge and enhance the biogas production. We address these challenges by proposing an IoT-based framework that aims to implement an End-to-End secure Cyber-Physical System (CPS) for biogas plants. The proposed framework encloses three layers: the perception layer which is mainly the industrial network, the network layer that develops the IT network inside the plant where the supervision and control is being conducted. In addition, the application layer which is defined by the IoT platform and software sensor to enable predictive analysis. To show the effectiveness of the proposed solution, we deployed the framework implementation on GNS3 that fully simulates the real conditions.},

abstract = {Automated understanding of worksteps in industrial assembly work is important for IoT-based assistive guidance technologies in employee-machine collaboration and for industrial IoT (IIoT) environments. Our aim is to identify macro worksteps using depth images and micro activities of employees during the assembly of ATM machines for auxiliary purposes in their daily complex tasks using hand-operated tools. Due to the advance of inertial measurement unit (IMU) technologies and pattern recognition systems [11], IMU based sensing together with machine learning have gained momentum on workstep recognition and were selected for this study in combination with a depth camera sensor which is mounted on a ceiling with a top-down angle. In this work the focus is at a seamless embedding of non-impeding body-worn IMUs or their integration into smart tools and IoT devices, and the depth sensor ensuring the privacy of the operators[5][7][8], allowing for unobstructed monitoring of tools’ usage pattern and thus assembly workstep recognition. The results for this study are evidenced with empirical observations of assembly workstep executions by (i) hand screwing, (ii) screw driver screwing, (iii) machine screwing, (iv) wrench screwing, with the null class being disproportionally dominant in the data set. Deep Learning models including LSTM, Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) and CNN architectures are proposed for the detection of micro activities and macro worksteps and the identification of the current workstep which will be beneficial also for the recognition of the transition between each two consecutive macro worksteps. A sophisticated counting mechanism of the classified activities is recognized as the next research challenge, with the extraction of features from each IMU sensor and the temporal information from the depth sensor, integrated in an IoT system.},

An open world virtual town was built utilizing the Unity 3D engine for visual immersion and interaction. It used the Google cardboard mobile virtual reality (VR) system as the head-mounted display (HDM), for information display and versatility. Lastly, the Unity network framework was incorporated to achieve simultaneous co-existence of up to 20 players.

Using remote sensing image classification technology to detect the environment has become a hot research topic, but the traditional classification accuracy of maximum likelihood classification needs to be improved, how to improve the accuracy of remote sensing image classification has become the key to the research. In this paper, on the basis of neural network, genetic algorithm is used to optimize RBF neural network to classify images, and an xxxx fuzzy RBF neural network based on genetic algorithm is proposed to classify remote sensing images. On the basis of fuzzy control, this method can make the algorithm jump out of the optimization process of minimum points and accurately solve the global optimal solution. Finally, by preprocessing remote sensing images, the BP neural network classification method based on genetic algorithm is used, and the SVM decision tree classification method based on JM distance is used as the comparison algorithm to verify the accuracy of remote sensing image classification in this paper. The experimental results show that the algorithm in this paper can improve the accuracy of remote sensing image classification compared with the above two algorithms.},

abstract = {The healthcare sectors have experienced a massive technical evolution over the past decade by integration of medical devices with IT at both physical and cyber level for a critical Health Care Information Infrastructure (HCII). HCII provides huge benefits for the health care service delivery but evolving digital interconnectivity among medical and IT devices has also changed the threat landscape. In particular, systems are now more exposed to the cyber-attacks due to sensitivity and criticality of patient health care information and accessibility of medical devices and this pose any potential disruption of healthcare service delivery. There is a need to enhance security and resilience of HCII. In this paper, we present a Cyber Security Situational Awareness Framework that aims to improve the security and resilience of the overall HCII. The framework aims to develop a novel dynamic Situational Awareness approach on the health care ecosystem. We consider bio inspired Swarm Intelligence and its inherent features with the main principles of the Risk and Privacy assessment and management and Incident handling to ensure security and resilience of healthcare service delivery.},

abstract = {The unrelenting growth of the memory needs of emerging datacenter applications, along with ever increasing cost and volatility of DRAM prices, has led to DRAM being a major infrastructure expense. Alternative technologies, such as NVMe SSDs and upcoming NVM devices, offer higher capacity than DRAM at a fraction of the cost and power. One promising approach is to transparently offload colder memory to cheaper memory technologies via kernel or hypervisor techniques. The key challenge, however, is to develop a datacenter-scale solution that is robust in dealing with diverse workloads and large performance variance of different offload devices such as compressed memory, SSD, and NVM. This paper presents TMO, Meta’s transparent memory offloading solution for heterogeneous datacenter environments. TMO introduces a new Linux kernel mechanism that directly measures in realtime the lost work due to resource shortage across CPU, memory, and I/O. Guided by this information and without any prior application knowledge, TMO automatically adjusts how much memory to offload to heterogeneous devices (e.g., compressed memory or SSD) according to the device’s performance characteristics and the application’s sensitivity to memory-access slowdown. TMO holistically identifies offloading opportunities from not only the application containers but also the sidecar containers that provide infrastructure-level functions. To maximize memory savings, TMO targets both anonymous memory and file cache, and balances the swap-in rate of anonymous memory and the reload rate of file pages that were recently evicted from the file cache. TMO has been running in production for more than a year, and has saved between 20-32\% of the total memory across millions of servers in our large datacenter fleet. We have successfully upstreamed TMO into the Linux kernel.},

abstract = {FPGAs are now used in public clouds to accelerate a wide range of applications, including many that operate on sensitive data such as financial and medical records. We present ShEF, a trusted execution environment (TEE) for cloud-based reconfigurable accelerators. ShEF is independent from CPU-based TEEs and allows secure execution under a threat model where the adversary can control all software running on the CPU connected to the FPGA, has physical access to the FPGA, and can compromise the FPGA interface logic of the cloud provider. ShEF provides a secure boot and remote attestation process that relies solely on existing FPGA mechanisms for root of trust. It also includes a Shield component that provides secure access to data while the accelerator is in use. The Shield is highly customizable and extensible, allowing users to craft a bespoke security solution that fits their accelerator's memory access patterns, bandwidth, and security requirements at minimum performance and area overheads. We describe a prototype implementation of ShEF for existing cloud FPGAs, map ShEF to a performant and secure storage application, and measure the performance benefits of customizable security using five additional accelerators.},

abstract = {The current constant of the virtual factor causes the expression "in person" to decrease at its frequency of effective embodiment. It is now being relegated to special situations, with extraordinarily formatted outlines, even assuming the value of a rarity to be avoided. In this way, the importance of the act of "being with" or "being in front of" increases as the time, in which the exception is suitable, must be taken for precious. The distance increase between people, and the emotional detachment from their living place, grounds for actions that promote the human desire to live collectively, share places, objects and experiences. The present research has the concern of developing and supporting, in a project approach, the life quality of people groups at urban areas, anchoring actions in specific characteristics of their identity legacy. Is intended to contribute to healthier social relationships establishment with the adequacy of social action methodologies sustained in artistic intervention as cultural space mediator. Throughout the works, was intended to demonstrate that participatory environments contribute to generate emotional ties. At interaction, meaning formation is benefited by the perception of specific cultural elements, rooted in memory, which people feel greater affinity, and can be integrated into content of the interactive installations production. These matters queries for what would be an appropriated procedure to discover local identity elements to be included in content production. According to this research, and in an attempt to adopt a methodology, was endeavored to structure a procedure for emerging social problems, to listen citizens and collect credible data that will serve to select contents that enhance well-being. Therefore, an iterative procedure has been produced, derived from Delphi method, from the area of Social Diagnosis, using anonymous consultation questionnaires at sample groups of individuals from a territory. It was established that in this procedure the discussion and validation of collected data will be done through a focus group formed by specialists. This innovative procedure is a starting point in the gathering of identity elements at groups of individuals, for the creation of multimedia installations in city spaces, with interactive sensory stimuli in the fields of vision, hearing, touch and proprioception, fostering the expansion of links between individuals, and of these with their place.},

abstract = {This article presents the conceptual proposal related to the construction of a transformational prosthesis, broadly understood as physical and psychic extensions of an individual, in short, as devices that allow them to change their external environment, and, consequently, transform their internal environment. According to the title, this study is in a preliminary stage of development, with a view to submission to development agencies. In its later stages, the project will consider the demands centered on users based on their context and experiences. Initially, the article describes the aim of the partnership, responsible for the production of the prosthesis, which is to develop an environment of scientific and artistic innovation in the synergy between the areas of Arts, Design, Mechatronics and Medicine, and, therefore, expand the possibility of the creation of special upper and lower limb prostheses. Such a partnership has been established between Dr. Monica Tavares, of the School of Communication and Arts at the University of S\~{a}o Paulo (USP), Dr. Chi-Nan Pai, of the Polytechnic School at USP, and Dr. Juliana Henno, of the European Institute of Design. Secondly, the project demonstrates the specifics of what is a transformational prosthesis, which results from the use of objectiles and digital fabrication techniques that aim to supply, correct or increase a given capacity or sense of the individual. Thirdly, it presents the differences between a functional prosthesis and a cosmetic prosthesis, pointing out the intention of the established partnership to work in synergy between art, science and technology, transposing the simple duality between the functional and the cosmetic; here, the initial studies of the functional structure of an upper limb prosthesis are also presented. And, fourthly, possibilities for aesthetic configurations of this prosthesis are shown, considering that the multiplicity and variability of visual options are the theme for its customization.},

abstract = {With improvements in the area of Internet of Things (IoT), surveillance systems have recently become more accessible. At the same time, optimizing the energy requirements of smart sensors, especially for data transmission, has always been very important and the energy efficiency of IoT systems has been the subject of numerous studies. For environmental monitoring scenarios, it is possible to extract more accurate information using smart multimedia sensors. However, multimedia data transmission is an expensive operation. In this study, a novel hierarchical approach is presented for the detection of forest fires. The proposed framework introduces a new approach in which multimedia and scalar sensors are used hierarchically to minimize the transmission of visual data. A lightweight deep learning model is also developed for devices at the edge of the network to improve detection accuracy and reduce the traffic between the edge devices and the sink. The framework is evaluated using a real testbed, network simulations, and 10-fold cross-validation in terms of energy efficiency and detection accuracy. Based on the results of our experiments, the validation accuracy of the proposed system is 98.28\%, and the energy saving is 29.94\%. The proposed deep learning model’s validation accuracy is very close to the accuracy of the best performing architectures when the existing studies and lightweight architectures are considered. In terms of suitability for edge computing, the proposed approach is superior to the existing ones with reduced computational requirements and model size.},

abstract = {Context-based copresence detection schemes are a necessary prerequisite to building secure and usable authentication systems in the Internet of Things (IoT). Such schemes allow one device to verify proximity of another device without user assistance utilizing their physical context (e.g., audio). The state-of-the-art copresence detection schemes suffer from two major limitations: (1) They cannot accurately detect copresence in low-entropy context (e.g., empty room with few events occurring) and insufficiently separated environments (e.g., adjacent rooms), (2) They require devices to have common sensors (e.g., microphones) to capture context, making them impractical on devices with heterogeneous sensors. We address these limitations, proposing Next2You, a novel copresence detection scheme utilizing channel state information (CSI). In particular, we leverage magnitude and phase values from a range of subcarriers specifying a Wi-Fi channel to capture a robust wireless context created when devices communicate. We implement Next2You on off-the-shelf smartphones relying only on ubiquitous Wi-Fi chipsets and evaluate it based on over 95 hours of CSI measurements that we collect in five real-world scenarios. Next2You achieves error rates below 4\%, maintaining accurate copresence detection both in low-entropy context and insufficiently separated environments. We also demonstrate the capability of Next2You to work reliably in real-time and its robustness to various attacks.},

abstract = {Programming is now introduced as an essential skill at a very young age, often through block-based programming environments. Interaction with programs created using such platforms typically occurs through the use of keyboard and mouse. Incorporating environmental data as real-time input to programs through physical computing devices can deliver an engaging programming experience that fosters creativity. However, using such devices with block-based environments often requires significant technical configuration, which can be challenging in the classroom, especially for very young learners. In this paper, we describe our design, development and use of a sensor toolkit and a companion Scratch extension that is very easy for young students to use. The toolkit allows students to focus on constructive exploration while providing teachers with an easy way to incorporate sensor-driven programming lessons in a time-constrained classroom setting. We deployed our toolkit in a primary school classroom with 19 students aged between 7 and 9, and two teachers who were introducing sensor-driven programming for the first time. We report how these young students used our toolkit to control actions in their programs, their post-session views of programming as an interesting and creative task, and the teachers’ perspectives of using the toolkit with young learners.},

abstract = {Aim to accelerate the process of lower limb rehabilitation for post-stroke people, various intelligent lower limb rehabilitation walkers (ILLRW) with body kinetic analysis and feedback control function have been developed to reduce the nursing workload and enhance training performance. In this work, a novel ILLRW is proposed, equipped with a walking remote system via control lever and driver units to assist user's walk correspondingly. However, the walking ability varied significantly from stroke persons, and a system that can interfere with the driving system to adjust the speed according to the pace is critical. Thus, we also developed a walk pattern prediction system (WPPS) to feedback and further optimize the control system. The WPPS includes a laser range finder (LRF) array and plantar pressure sensors at the bottom, wearable pressure sensors at the user's waist, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) at the user's body joints. Altogether, the data get further analyzed and a walk pattern model generated while walking, and it is expected that the movement of the walker can relatively match the user's pace. Experimental result shows that our WPPS can track stroke patient's movement pattern effectively.},

abstract = {In modern society, the economic digitalization is gaining momentum, covering almost all its spheres. The versatility and diversity of consumer behavior that exists in each society changes the previous, well-established business models radically. Global changes have also affected the sphere of insurance services. With the advent of insurance technologies, the insurance culture in modern Russia is in constant development. The purpose of this paper is to describe the essence of the InsurTech technology and the psychological grounds for its application in Russian practice. As a result, five bases of psychological analysis were identified when determining the types (or strategies) of insurance behavior, namely, benefit, rationality of choice, risk sensitivity, financial anxiety, and attitude to insurance policy. The psychotypes of policyholders depending on their psychological attitudes are given: "paternalists", "market suppoters" and "neutral". It is concluded that the peculiarities of the attitude of Russian citizens to insurance services in the virtual environment have not yet been sufficiently studied, and research on the transformation of insurance consumers thanks to InsurTech is practically not presented. Nevertheless, there are some trends in the transformation of the behavior of the consumers of insurance services under the influence of the Internet technologies. That is why the makers of both psychological characteristics and demographic variables (sex, age, income level, employment) should be taken into account when developing insurance scoring for aggregators InsurTech.},

abstract = {Climate change and migration have become one of the most challenging problems for our civilization. In this context, city councils work hard to manage essential services for citizens such as waste collection, street lamp lighting, and water supply. Increasingly, digitalization and the Internet of Things (IoT) help cities improve services, increase productivity and reduce costs. However, to understand how this may happen, we explore the urban sensing capabilities from citizen- to city-scale, how sensing at different levels is interlinked, and the challenges of managing innovations based on IoT data and devices.Local authorities collaborate with researchers and deploy testbeds as a part of demonstration and research projects to perform the above data collection, improve city services, and support innovation. The data gathered is about indoor and outdoor environmental conditions, energy usage, built environment, structural health monitoring. Such monitoring requires IT infrastructure at three different tiers: at the endpoint, edge, and cloud. Managing infrastructure at all tiers with provisioning, connectivity, security updates of devices, user data privacy controls, visualization of data, multi-tenancy of applications, and network resilience, is challenging. So, in turn, we focus on performing a systematic study of the technical and non-technical challenges faced during the implementation, management, and deployment of devices into citizens' homes and public spaces.Our third piece of work explores IoT edge applications' resiliency and reliability requirements that vary from non-critical (best delivery efforts) to safety-critical with time-bounded guarantees. We investigate how to meet IoT application mixed-criticality QoS requirements in multi-communication networks.Finally, to demonstrate the principles of our framework in the real world, we implement an open-source air quality platform Open City Air Quality Platform (OpenCAQP), that merges a wide range of data sources and air pollution parameters into a single platform. The OpenCAQP allows citizens, environmentalists, data analysts, and developers to access and visualize that data.},

abstract = {FPGA-enabled cloud computing is getting more and more common as cloud providers offer hardware accelerated solutions. In this context, clients need confidential remote computing. However Intellectual Properties and data are being used and communicated. So current security models require the client to trust the cloud provider blindly by disclosing sensitive information. In addition, the lack of strong authentication and access control mechanisms, for both the client and the provided FPGA in current solutions, is a major security drawback. To enhance security measures and privacy between the client, the cloud provider and the FPGA, an additional entity needs to be introduced: the trusted authority. Its role is to authenticate the client-FPGA pair and isolate them from the cloud provider. With our novel OAuth 2.0-based access delegation solution for FPGA-accelerated clouds, a remote confidential FPGA environment with a token-based access can be created for the client. Our solution allows to manage and securely allocate heterogeneous resource pools with enhanced privacy \&amp; confidentiality for the client. Our formal analysis shows that our protocol adds a very small latency which is suitable for real-time application.},

abstract = {Mobile crowdsensing systems typically operate centralized cloud storage management, and the environment data sensed by the participants are usually uploaded to certain central cloud servers. Instead, this article addresses the decentralized data storage problem in scenarios where cloud servers or network infrastructures do not work as expected and the sensing data have to be temporarily stored on the mobile devices carried by the participants. Considering that the sensing data are generally correlated, this article investigates a compressive distributed storage scheme for mobile crowdsensing. We notice a key observation: when a participant has a random walk in the target sensing area, his walking/sensing process can be considered as a random sampling for the entire area, although the activity of the participant may only have a local scope. We then propose an encoding algorithm based on compressive sensing theory. Each participant encodes the sensing data in their local trajectory, but the encoded CS measurement is capable of roughly reflecting the entire information of the whole area. While a participant stores a blurred global image of the target sensing area, the entire data can then be collaboratively stored by a certain number of participants. We further present a period-based data recovery algorithm to exploit the inter-period correlations, improving the recovery accuracy. Experimental results using real environmental data demonstrate the performance of the proposed compressive storage scheme. The test datasets and our source codes are available at .},

abstract = {Cloud-based Natural Language Understanding (NLU) services are becoming more popular with the development of artificial intelligence. More applications are integrated with cloud-based NLU services to enhance the way people communicate with machines. However, with NLU services provided by different companies powered by unrevealed AI technology, how to choose the best one is a problem for developers. Existing tools that can provide guidance to developers and make recommendations based on their needs are severely limited. This article comprehensively evaluates multiple state-of-the-art NLU services, and the results indicate that there is no absolute winner for different usage requirements. Motivated by this observation, we provide several insights and propose&nbsp;NLUBroker, a Quality of Experience-driven (QoE-driven) broker system, to select the proper service according to the environment. NLUBroker senses the client and service status and leverages a solution to the multi-armed bandit problem to conduct online learning, aiming to achieve maximum expected QoE. The performance of&nbsp;NLUBroker is evaluated in both simulation and real-world environments, and the evaluation results demonstrate that&nbsp;NLUBroker is an efficient solution for selecting NLU services. It is adaptive to changes in the environment, outperforms three baseline methods we evaluated and improves overall QoE up to 1.5\texttimes{} for the evaluated state-of-the-art NLU services.},

abstract = {Google recently introduced a secure chip called Titan&nbsp;M in its Pixel smartphones, enabling the implementation of a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) in Tamper Resistant Hardware. TEEs have been proven effective in reducing the attack surface exposed by smartphones, by protecting specific security-sensitive operations. However, studies have shown that TEE code and execution can also be targeted and exploited by attackers, therefore, studying their security lays the basis of the trust we have in their features. In this paper, we provide the first security analysis of Titan&nbsp;M. First, we reverse engineer the firmware and we review the open source code in the Android OS that is responsible for the communication with the chip. By exploiting a known vulnerability, we then dynamically examine the memory layout and the internals of the chip. Finally, leveraging the acquired knowledge, we design and implement a structure-aware black-box fuzzer. Using our fuzzer, we rediscover several known vulnerabilities after a few seconds of testing, proving the effectiveness of our solution. In addition, we identify and report a new vulnerability in the latest version of the firmware.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) have been developed in many industrial sectors and application domains in which the quality requirements of data acquired are a common factor. Data quality in CPS can deteriorate because of several factors such as sensor faults and failures due to operating in harsh and uncertain environments. How can software engineering and artificial intelligence (AI) help manage and tame data quality issues in CPS? This is the question we aimed to investigate in the SEA4DQ workshop. Emerging trends in software engineering need to take data quality management seriously as CPS are increasingly datacentric in their approach to acquiring and processing data along the edge-fog-cloud continuum. This workshop provided researchers and practitioners a forum for exchanging ideas, experiences, understanding of the problems, visions for the future, and promising solutions to the problems in data quality in CPS. Examples of topics include software/hardware architectures and frameworks for data quality management in CPS; software engineering and AI to detect anomalies in CPS data or to repair erroneous CPS data. SEA4DQ 2021, which took place on August 24th, 2021 was a satellite event of the ACM Joint European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (ESEC / FSE) 2021. The workshop attracted 35 international participants and was exciting with a great keynote, six excellent presentations, and concluded on a high note with a panel discussion. SEA4DQ was motivated by the common research interests from the EU projects for Zero-Defects Manufacturing such as InterQ and Dat4.Zero.},

This paper details the reinvention of a public space in Clearwater, Florida with a large-scale mural program. We discuss the development of an interactive augmented reality (AR) app that utilizes a 3D terrestrial lidar scan to assist in the identification and testing of feature points within target images of the mural. The combination of multisensory stimuli, including physical cues in the built environment, and audiovisual cues from the app, reinforce the artwork's message of community empowerment, while enhancing the public perception of downtown Clearwater as a destination for art, culture, and technology.},

abstract = {With the advancement of the Internet of Things in our smart environment, smart devices are working without human intervention. So home can be converted to intelligent home automation systems to perform its computation automatically. In a pandemic situation, the majority of people have spent their maximum time at home. So indoor air quality, insider’s and outsider’s health monitoring has become an important issue. As respiratory diseases are the main concern for pandemics, we have to develop an intelligent home system model to monitor healthy environmental conditions for the users. This paper proposes an energy-efficient smart system model to monitor the health and environmental condition by measuring the carbon monoxide threat level that indirectly affects other atmospheric parameters. Our system alerts when the carbon monoxide level exceeds the safe level. Remote monitoring of the home and health parameters is done in real-time with the help of the system model. For this purpose, we are adopting Dempster-Shafer evidence theory as a mathematical model to aggregate the data coming from different sensors. The sensor nodes track the home and health parameters such as room temperature, humidity, carbon monoxide level, SpO2 level, body temperature, and pulse rate. The smartphone app updates the user’s real-time sensor data through the display and indirectly helps to maintain the physical distance. The proposed intelligent home-health system model is compact, cost-effective, energy-efficient for the user, and is especially useful for the quarantined covid affected people in a pandemic situation.},
