abstract = {Smart clothing has exhibited impressive body pose/movement tracking capabilities while preserving the soft, comfortable, and familiar nature of clothing. For practical everyday use, smart clothing should (1) be available in a range of sizes to accommodate different fit preferences, and (2) be washable to allow repeated use. In SeamFit, we demonstrate washable T-shirts, embedded with capacitive seam electrodes, available in three different sizes, for exercise logging. Our T-shirt design, customized signal processing \&amp; machine learning pipeline allow the SeamFit system to generalize across users, fits, and wash cycles. Prior wearable exercise logging solutions, which often attach a miniaturized sensor to a body location, struggle to track exercises that mainly involve other body parts. SeamFit T-shirt naturally covers a large area of the body and still tracks exercises that mainly involve uncovered joints (e.g., elbows and the lower body). In a user study with 15 participants performing 14 exercises, SeamFit detects exercises with an accuracy of 89\%, classifies exercises with an accuracy of 93.4\%, and counts exercises with an error of 0.9 counts, on average. SeamFit is a step towards practical smart clothing for everyday uses.},

abstract = {Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) facilitates computations on encrypted data without requiring access to the decryption key, offering substantial privacy benefits for deploying neural network applications in sensitive sectors such as healthcare and finance. Nonetheless, programming these applications within the FHE framework is complex and demands extensive cryptographic expertise to guarantee correctness, performance, and security.                                In this paper, we present ANT-ACE, a production-quality, open-source FHE compiler designed to automate neural network inference on encrypted data. ANT-ACE accepts ONNX models and generates C/C++ programs, leveraging its custom open-source FHE library. We explore the design challenges encountered in the development of ANT-ACE, which is engineered to support a variety of input formats and architectures across diverse FHE schemes through a novel Intermediate Representation (IR) that facilitates multiple levels of abstraction. Comprising 44,000 lines of C/C++ code, ANT-ACE efficiently translates ONNX models into C/C++ programs for encrypted inference on CPUs, specifically utilizing the RNS-CKKS scheme. Preliminary evaluations on a single CPU indicate that ANT-ACE achieves significant speed enhancements in ResNet models, surpassing expert manual implementations and fulfilling our design goals.},

abstract = {Remote sensor data can provide valuable insights. For example, data about animal migration patterns can inform conservation efforts, microclimate knowledge can be used to predict weather events, and city usage data can be used to inform infrastructure planning. However, networking sensor systems is an engineering hurdle that must be overcome to gain this crucial information at scale. We argue that to efficiently retrieve data, we should treat data files in sensor systems like the ducks in the classic story "Make Way for Ducklings" by Robert McCloskey. In the story, in order for the ducks to reunite their family, they must cross a bustling downtown Boston. Despite all the complexities of highways, bikes, and pedestrians, the ducks safely make their journey thanks to people clearing a path. In this paper, we argue that we must similarly "clear the path" for data retrieval in sensor systems and that doing so requires hiding the complexity of networking sensor platforms. Specifically, we argue that a desirable developer experience would be to simply write data to a local file on a sensor platform and have the files "magically" appear in a cloud storage location. To make progress towards this vision, we use the SD protocol as a narrow waist to decouple the network stack from sensor platform development. We call this system SDcloud and present a prototype SDcloud implementation as a proof-of-concept for networking sensors. We also discuss additional benefits that focusing on the data files in sensor networks can enable such as data processing applications.},

abstract = {Wireless sensing technologies leveraging the acoustic and RF sensors in smart devices have advanced to enable accurate contactless monitoring of vital signs such as breathing and heartbeat. Wireless signal monitoring can enable important health applications, such as determining emotional states, detecting critical health conditions, and providing suitable interventions. While offering non-invasiveness and privacy advantages over wearables and cameras, these technologies pose serious privacy risks. The improved sensing accuracy allows any unauthorized sensor to detect sensitive health data without consent. This paper proposes VitalHide, a novel approach to protect vital signs from unauthorized sensing while still enabling wireless sensing for authorized devices. The key idea of VitalHide is to obfuscate the user's vital signs by generating a deceiving vital sign motion using a wearable mechanical device. The obfuscated signal can then only be decoded at authorized devices, while unauthorized devices receive deceiving vital signs. We show the feasibility of VitalHide by generating motion using a vibration sensor and shape memory alloy (SMA)-based smart textile, and the successful decoding of the obfuscated vital sign signal at the authorized receiver. This work advances privacy-preserving wireless sensing by securing personal health information against unauthorized access without affecting the utility of authorized devices.},

This paper proposed a software architecture designed based on microservices to address the complex and evolving requirements of contemporary agriculture and aquaculture systems locations. These systems demand a versatile platform capable of integrating a wide range of functionalities, including environmental monitoring, aquaculture management, and comprehensive record-keeping for crops and aquatic life.

abstract = {With the continuous development of drone remote sensing technology, drone networks have garnered widespread attention. The application of drones has expanded from military uses to industrial and civilian sectors, facilitating tasks such as automated combat, production, and rescue operations. However, since drones operate in public environments, their communications are vulnerable to physical attacks and tampering, which can lead to privacy leaks and pose security risks. Additionally, as resource-constrained devices, drones find it difficult to support complex encryption algorithms. To address this issue, this paper proposes a lightweight authentication protocol based on Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF). This protocol leverages PUF to prevent physical capture attacks and enhances system efficiency through hash and XOR operations. Furthermore, trust management technology is applied to further evaluate the network access behavior of drones, ensuring trustworthy access to the drone network. The security of this protocol is verified using the ROR model and AVISPA tool, and informal analysis demonstrates that it meets the security requirements of drone networks. Compared with existing protocols, this protocol shows significant advantages in terms of computational and communication overhead, achieving a good balance between security and efficiency.},

abstract = {With the increasing level of automation in the power system, the scale and complexity of the power Internet of Things are also constantly increasing. However, with the increase in the scale of the power Internet of Things, the security risks it faces are also constantly increasing. The data and information involved in the power Internet of Things contain a large amount of sensitive information, such as user information, power equipment information, energy management information, and so on. Once this information is leaked or tampered with, it will cause great losses to the power system. Therefore, the security issue of the power Internet of Things has become an urgent problem to be solved. Therefore, this article proposes a trusted attestation protocol for the power Internet of Things, which comprehensively evaluates and authenticates the identity, security, and credibility of terminal devices, ensuring that terminals can access network communication while complying with security policies in the "cloud edge end" environment, ensuring the security of the communication network. This protocol can prevent malicious access from non trustworthy IoT terminals, improve the reliability and security of the entire power IoT system, and thus ensure the stable operation of the power system.},

abstract = {In contemporary urban ecological development and resource management, the establishment of urban green spaces is a crucial indicator of urban ecological quality and plays a significant role in improving the ecological environment. Therefore, accurate identification of green spaces is vital for urban ecological development. Remote sensing technology is commonly used for green space identification; however, traditional methods for sample point labeling are cumbersome and labor-intensive, limiting the application of large-scale data processing. Hence, a more efficient method for automatic sample point generation is needed. To alleviate the burden of manual sample point labeling, this study proposes an algorithm and selection rules for automatic sample point generation based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. The algorithm relies on adding random points within the pixel mask layer of an unsupervised classification result map. By merging closely spaced random points, the algorithm purifies and assigns attribute values to generate sample points with attributes. The sample points generated by this method are comparable to those manually labeled on maps. This algorithm and selection rules not only apply to the specific context of this study but also have considerable potential for selecting sample points in other land cover types. Although the classification result accuracy (91.9\%) is slightly lower compared to manual labeling (98.7\%), this method significantly enhances work efficiency and reduces the labor required for manual labeling. Additionally, the algorithm demonstrates good portability. The automatic sample point generation algorithm, combined with the sample point selection rules, has significant application prospects in map data processing and can provide strong support for urban ecological development.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of deep learning technology, its application in the field of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) represents a significant leap from traditional detection methods. This paper aims to explore how deep learning algorithms enhance the assessment of civil infrastructure integrity by analyzing large datasets from sensors. We first introduce the background of SHM, highlighting the shortcomings of traditional methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Next, we employ deep learning models for data analysis, investigating their applications in structural damage detection and prediction. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing literature, we find that deep learning not only overcomes the limitations of manual inspections but also significantly improves the overall performance of SHM by enhancing real-time monitoring capabilities. Furthermore, this paper discusses hybrid systems that combine data-driven models with physical understanding, as well as the distributed intelligence brought about by edge computing. These factors collectively provide more reliable and flexible solutions for future infrastructure management. Our key findings indicate that the application of deep learning can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of SHM, enabling a quicker response to the needs of dynamic communities.},

In consideration of the distinctive attributes of high-dimensional, nonlinear, and strongly spatiotemporally correlated marine data, the model employs an enhanced deep neural network architecture. Initially, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) was employed for the purpose of reducing the dimensionality of the data set and extracting the most pertinent features, thus enabling the effective handling of the noise and redundant information inherent to marine data. Subsequently, the spatiotemporal dependencies in the data were mined using a spatiotemporal convolutional neural network (ST-CNN) with a self-attention mechanism, enabling high-precision prediction and classification of ocean parameters. The model has been optimised to account for the distinctive characteristics of marine data, thereby enhancing its capacity to adapt to complex marine environments.},

We achieved completely model-free policies by end-to-end training of sensor-action neural networks.

Currently, mainstream electric field meters primarily use rotating shield electrodes as electric field detection probes. These probes detect charges in a spatial electric field through an induction plate. A rotating motor connects the grounded electrode on the induction plate, and the process of exposing, blocking, and shielding the induction electrode changes the induced charge, generating an induced current. However, such electric field meters are bulky and expensive. The aim of this study is to design a miniature membrane-type atmospheric electric field meter with electromagnetic drive using electrostatic induction from conductors.

abstract = {In recent years, the field of emotion recognition has witnessed significant advancements, with applications spanning from healthcare monitoring to human-computer interaction. However, deploying such systems on resource-constrained end devices, such as wearable sensors or mobile phones, remains a challenging task due to limitations in computational power, memory, and battery life. This paper proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by utilizing lightweight deep learning models that are specifically designed to operate efficiently on such devices. The proposed system integrates multi-physiological signals, including Electrocardiogram (ECG), Photoplethysmographic (PPG) readings, Heartbeat Rate (HR), Skin Temperature measurements (SKT), and Respiratory patterns (RSP) to provide a comprehensive assessment of emotional states. We evaluate the performance of our system on a dataset of physiological signals collected from subjects undergoing video emotional stimuli. Experimental results demonstrate that our lightweight models achieve comparable accuracy to heavier models while significantly reducing computational overhead and power consumption. The findings of this study pave the way for the development of practical, real-time emotion recognition systems that can be deployed on a wide range of resource-constrained end devices.},

abstract = {Deploying low-cost sensors to collect large-scale regional data is necessary in numerous applications such as environmental monitoring. However, the manual collection of sensor data is cost-ineffective. With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technologies, the collection of sensor data by UAVs has emerged as a promising approach. Therefore, it is often crucial to optimally deploy UAVs for efficient data collection to ensure low Age of Information (AoI) and low energy consumption. To describe data freshness and account for volume,, we propose a new data value measurement metric termed  ({rm{eAoI}}) , inspired by AoI. To consider both the data value and energy consumption, we further define a new concept: data value per energy unit. We consider the scenario where distributed sensors generate data continuously, while a set of UAVs are deployed for efficient data collection. We aim to maximize data collection efficiency, namely, the overall eAoI gain per energy unit cost throughout the collection operation lifecycle. We propose K-MADDPG, where all actors share a single Critic, enhanced with Kolmogorov–Arnold networks (KAN). The UAVs in the K-MADDPG framework had distributed decision-making capability, and could dynamically adjust their trajectory strategy according to the environment. Simulation results demonstrate that K-MADDPG exhibits significant improvement in terms of both convergence speed and performance.},

abstract = {The automotive industry has witnessed substantial growth in recent years, marking the onset of the era of fully autonomous driving. Simultaneously, the development of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems seeks to mitigate spectrum scarcity by integrating radar and communication transceivers into a unified framework. Ensuring road traffic safety necessitates vehicles acquiring timely information about the positions of other vehicles to facilitate effective avoidance. However, line-of-sight paths between base stations (BS) and vehicles, as well as between vehicles themselves, are frequently obstructed by both static and dynamic obstacles. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have emerged as innovative technologies for shaping wireless propagation environments, owing to their potential to enhance wireless communication. RISs have recently assumed a critical role in reshaping wireless propagation environments, thereby enhancing received signal strength and spectral efficiency.},

abstract = {Productive Failure (PF) is a learning approach where students initially tackle novel problems targeting concepts they have not yet learned, followed by a consolidation phase where these concepts are taught. Recent application in STEM disciplines suggests that PF can help learners develop more robust conceptual knowledge. However, empirical validation of PF for programming education remains under-explored. In this paper, we investigate the use of PF to teach Python lists to undergraduate students with limited prior programming experience. We designed a novel PF-based learning activity that incorporated the unobtrusive collection of real-time heart-rate data from consumer-grade wearable sensors. This sensor data was used both to make the learning activity engaging and to infer cognitive load. We evaluated our approach with 20 participants, half of whom were taught Python concepts using Direct Instruction (DI), and the other half with PF. We found that although there was no difference in initial learning outcomes between the groups, students who followed the PF approach showed better knowledge retention and performance on delayed but similar tasks. In addition, physiological measurements indicated that these students also exhibited a larger decrease in cognitive load during their tasks after instruction. Our findings suggest that PF-based approaches may lead to more robust learning, and that future work should investigate similar activities at scale across a range of concepts.},

abstract = {Mental fatigue is a crucial aspect that has gained attention across various disciplines due to its impact on overall well-being. While previous research has explored the use of wearable devices for detecting mental fatigue, limited investigation has been conducted into the effectiveness of these devices in different body positions or in multi-device setups. To address this, our study utilizes a unique public dataset containing over 13 hours of sensor data collected across 36 sessions, with four wearable devices (Earable, Chestband, Wristband, and Headband). We propose several machine learning-based approaches to assess both psychological and physiological mental fatigue levels in a multimodal and multi-device environment. Specifically, we introduce device type-specific approaches (trained and tested on a single device) and multi-device approaches (trained and tested on multiple devices) for mental fatigue inference tasks. Our findings show that device type-specific models perform well, with AUC scores ranging from 0.63 to 0.69 for psychological and from 0.74 to 0.80 for physiological mental fatigue. The multi-device approach shows improved performance for psychological mental fatigue (AUC of 0.69 to 0.74) and physiological mental fatigue (AUC of 0.81 to 0.88). Hence, this study presents a unique and in-depth analysis of detecting mental fatigue with wearables, demonstrating the potential of machine learning-based approaches in multi-device and multimodal setups that are prevalent in today’s emerging lifestyles.},

AR is an established tool for digital placemaking, which is a participatory form of embodied space-based social practice. While there is disagreement over whether digital placemaking is best achieved through organic engagement with locative media, deliberate urban planning initiatives, or a combination of both, it is increasingly clear that well-designed AR can impact how citizens perceive and engage with their physical surroundings and can invigorate urban spaces. In this article, we explore the design and development of ARTours Clearwater, an AR app that was developed as part of a city-led public art initiative aimed at increasing foot traffic and enlivening a downtown district through the creation of vivid, memorable, “imageable” spaces. The app development workflow encompassed terrestrial lidar scanning of the murals, the identification of tracking images in Vuforia, the development and scaling of digital animations in Unity, and onsite testing to evaluate environmental conditions. The project came to fruition at a public launch, which promoted novel forms of people-place interactions by bringing together multiple stakeholder groups in a synchronous event that enlivened the city’s downtown.},

abstract = {Sleep is a vital process for overall health and well-being. This is a critical physiological state categorised by altered consciousness, reduced sensory activity and minimal voluntary muscle movement. During this time our body engages in myriad of restorative processes such as repairing damaged tissues, synthesizing proteins, release of growth hormones, muscle recovery and overall cellular regeneration. Without proper sleep our physical and mental health will deteriorate rapidly which leads to a weakened immune system and illness. Beyond restoration, sleep plays an important role in cognitive functions. Chronic lack of sleep leads to a large number of health problems including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease etc. Sleep deprivation impairs cognitive function leading to decreased productivity and poor decision-making. Maintaining healthy sleep patterns have a huge impact on emotional resilience and overall mental well-being. It also helps in enhancing our ability to concentrate, boosts creativity and social interactions. The research paper begins with an extensive literature review on sleep instability and impact of sleep on cognitive skills. We highlight the challenges, consequences of sleep instability by analysis of individual daily habits. The following sections and methodologies provide a detailed information on the process adopted for dataset collection and analysis. In this study we consider several daily habits such as smoking, consumption of alcohol, caffeine to develop few predictive models. Later, the study presents the results of the detailed analysis of sleep habits and reasoning scores. The results of this study will provide insights to the quality of sleep and its effect on reasoning score.},

However, the existing detection systems face three main challenges: high false alarm rate and redundant information problems, difficulty in identifying multi-target dispersed homologous signals, and complex signal detection problems with spatio-temporal dispersion. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a weak signal detection model based on knowledge base, by integrating the data of distributed computing framework and ESOM time series analysis methods into the system design, and adds data filtering and signal analysis and state evaluation engine to the existing detection sensors. The experimental results show that this method not only significantly reduces the systematic false alarm rate, but also effectively improves the detection ability of complex signals, providing a new technical path for weak signal detection in big data environment.},

abstract = {Stunting detection is a significant issue in Indonesian healthcare, causing lower cognitive function, lower productivity, a weakened immunity, delayed neuro-development, and degenerative diseases. In regions with a high prevalence of stunting and limited welfare resources, identifying children in need of treatment is critical. The diagnostic process often raises challenges, such as the lack of experience in medical workers, incompatible anthropometric equipment, and inefficient medical bureaucracy. To counteract the issues, the use of load cell sensor and ultrasonic sensor can provide suitable anthropometric equipment and streamline the medical bureaucracy for stunting detection. This paper also employs machine learning for stunting detection based on sensor readings. The experiment results show that the sensitivity of the load cell sensor and the ultrasonic sensor is 0.9919 and 0.9986, respectively. Also, the machine learning test results have three classification classes, which are normal, stunted, and stunting with an accuracy rate of 98\%.

These three explosives were regarded as goal odors, while citral and air were no-goal odors. The analysis of local field potential (LFP) power changes revealed that, goal, and no-goals could be distinguished in both the vector group and the OR3 group at concentrations as low as 10-12 mol/L, and the classification performance of the OR3 group was superior to that of the vector group overall. Our findings suggest that OR3 bioengineered rats can reliably and accurately identify trace explosives, which provides a novel approach for detecting and identifying explosives with promising applications in odor discrimination in complex environments.},

abstract = {Abstract — This paper presents an automated plantar pressure monitoring system using the Internet of Things (IoT) for early detection of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). DFUs are common complications of diabetes that can negatively impact the life of a patient. Usual treatments for DFUs are drastic as they may include amputating the area affected, which is why this study aims to create a wearable foot device with a real-time monitoring system powered by the Internet of Things (IoT) to measure the plantar pressure experienced by the user. An important aspect of the prototype of this study is that it follows the three paradigms of intelligent manufacturing systems: sensing, smart, and sustainable. There will be force-sensitive resistors (FSR) to measure the plantar pressure and an LED to alert the user if an abnormal pressure is detected. Additionally, the smart feature will be represented by the IoT system that will notify the user if the plantar pressure experienced by the user exceeds the plantar threshold of 200 kPa. This system was made possible through the use of the Arduino IoT cloud, wherein the values of the FSRs and LED status can be monitored in the dashboard in real-time. The system will also automatically notify the user using the dashboard and by the LED, which turns red once any of the FSRs senses pressure greater than the threshold. To potentially help patients prevent DFUs from occurring, the prototype is designed to be a low-cost, non-disposable, reusable, and universal product.},

abstract = {Temporal sequences have become pervasive in various real-world applications such as finance, spatial mobility, health records, and so on. Consequently, the volume of data generated in the form of continuous-time event sequence(s) or CTES(s) has increased exponentially in the past few years. Thus, a significant fraction of the ongoing research on CTES datasets involves designing models to address downstream tasks such as next-event prediction, long-term forecasting, sequence classification, and so on. The recent developments in predictive modeling using marked temporal point processes (MTPP) have enabled an accurate characterization of several real-world applications involving the CTESs. However, due to the complex nature of these CTES datasets, the task of large-scale retrieval of temporal sequences has been overlooked by the past literature. In detail, by CTES retrieval we mean that for an input query sequence, a retrieval system must return a ranked list of relevant sequences from a large corpus. To tackle this, we propose NeuroSeqRet, a first-of-its-kind framework designed specifically for end-to-end CTES retrieval. Specifically, NeuroSeqRet introduces multiple enhancements over standard retrieval frameworks and first applies a trainable unwarping function on the query sequence which makes it comparable with corpus sequences, especially when a relevant query-corpus pair has individually different attributes. Next, it feeds the unwarped query sequence and the corpus sequence into MTPP-guided neural relevance models. We develop four variants of the relevance model for different kinds of applications based on the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. We also propose an optimization framework to learn binary sequence embeddings from the relevance scores, suitable for the locality-sensitive hashing leading to a significant speedup in returning top-K results for a given query sequence. Our experiments with several datasets show the significant accuracy boost of NeuroSeqRet beyond several baselines, as well as the efficacy of our hashing mechanism.},

abstract = {Limited outdoor activities and inadequate exercise pose health risks that can contribute to cardiovascular diseases. Monitoring one's body composition can be done by determining the body fat percentage (BF\%), a good indicator of overall body fat composition as it separates fat excess from weight excess compared to Body Mass Index. The U.S. Navy Method formula uses body circumference measurements as parameters to estimate BF\% conveniently. Thus, this study aims to develop a microcontroller-based calculating system that automatically calculates BF\% using the U.S. Navy Method formula using Arduino UNO R3 and Arduino Nano. A main system containing an ultrasonic sensor is used to extract the height of an individual. In contrast, a secondary system uses a rotary encoder to read body circumference measurements (neck, waist, and hip). Transceiver modules are used to transfer measurements between systems wirelessly. The overall system's performance was assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test by comparing the estimated BF\% of the system and the skinfold method. The calculated test statistic 120 and p-value 0.06 are greater than the critical value 116 and the significance level 0.05, respectively. Hence, no significant difference exists between the calculated BF\% using the system and the skinfold method.},

abstract = {As the development of new power systems progresses, the edge side exhibits emerging challenges such as diversified new network services, rapid extensions of access and local networks, and a dramatic increase in the number of sensing terminals. These conditions pose extremely severe challenges to security protection. Traditional network security situation awareness models are predominantly software-based, neglecting the intensive I/O overhead in big data network environments. Such approaches fail to keep pace with the increasing network traffic in new power systems and do not fully meet the demands for high concurrency and low latency. Additionally, conventional methods lack effective security isolation measures, rendering systems vulnerable to malicious attacks and security breaches, potentially triggering a series of stability issues within the system. In response, this paper proposes an integrated hardware-software co-design architecture for traffic extraction based on Data Processing Unit (DPU). By offloading some regex matching tasks to the hardware, this architecture significantly enhances the system's overall processing capability and throughput. Furthermore, this study introduces a multi-source fusion-based network security situation awareness model tailored for new power system environments, markedly improving the accurate identification of attack behaviors and providing robust support for network security.},

abstract = {The current landscape of data-centric Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) encompasses a fusion of Human-driven Vehicles (HVs), Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), Road-Side Units (RSUs), and edge-based devices engaged in periodic communication. Given the stringent latency requirements inherent in vehicular communications, the emergence of edge-based vehicular Digital Twins (DTs) plays a pivotal role in problem-solving, ensuring rapid response, regulatory compliance, and seamless availability. While these communications serve as the backbone of IoV, they also create an opportune environment for cybercriminals to exploit. Vulnerabilities at the network layer facilitate intrusions, resulting in a surge of data falsification attacks in recent years. Addressing this challenge demands resilient and intelligent threat detection schemes capable of adapting to the dynamic nature of IoV. This study conducts a comprehensive examination of the vulnerabilities in Vehicle-to-Digital twin (V2DT) data communication through the lens of an attacker utilizing False Data Injection Attack (FDIA). It utilizes cutting-edge Blockchain-based decentralized storage and buffering mechanisms for vehicle dynamics data en route to edge-based DTs. Further, deep learning-powered sensor data analysis serves as an additional layer of security. Evaluation of the proposed threat detection and mitigation model demonstrates 100\% tamper detection in V2DT communication, coupled with a 96\% accurate classification of anomalous driving behaviors, including aggressive driving or FDIAs.},

abstract = {Face authentication (FA) schemes are widely adopted in smart homes nowadays. However, existing FA systems for smart appliances are commonly camera-based and hence experience performance degradation in poor illumination conditions. Mainstream FA systems based on radio frequency require dedicated hardware that is inaccessible to many appliances. In this paper, we propose an acoustic signals-based FA scheme that extracts acoustic signal features associated with facial 3D geometries to achieve FA named SoundFace. This scheme can be widely deployed on most appliances in home environments. We propose a novel two-stage locating approach based on acoustic sensing to capture the signal variation of the user’s face and separate the face region echoes from multipath interferences in the distance dimension. To obtain distinguishable facial features, we design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based feature extractor. In addition, the acoustic signal is highly susceptible to different changes in practical authentication. To overcome it, we utilize a transfer learning technique with little training overhead to enable SoundFace resilient to various authentication changes. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SoundFace achieves an average true authentication rate of over 96.2\% and an equal error rate of 4.2\%, and it is robust to various real-world settings.},

In the complex and dynamic agricultural environment, the development of agricultural information monitoring technology and systems continues to face numerous challenges. Addressing this situation, this paper focuses on the key technology for agricultural information monitoring in greenhouse environments. First, based on Arduino and Zigbee technology, an agricultural information collection system composed of data collection nodes and gateway nodes is constructed. This system features a wide range of sensor interfaces, diverse data interaction methods, and robust data transmission capabilities. Second, the deployment of the agricultural information monitoring system in a greenhouse environment is analyzed in-depth, and corresponding deployment strategies are proposed.

abstract = {With the rapid development of smart health care, accurate heart rate variability (HRV) estimation for the early detection of diseases has become a hot research topic. Advanced work uses the wireless signal to estimate the heartbeat in a contact-free way, which usually cannot separate multiple users or work in a dynamic environment. In this article, we propose a lightweight heartbeat-sensing method based on RFID tag pairs, which focuses on HRV extraction in a more general sensing scenario. Based on the tag-pair design, we build a novel heartbeat and respiration model to describe the signal relationship between the two tags from the time and space domains. Based on the model, we propose a Calibrated Temporal-Spatial IQ-Shaping-based signal cancellation algorithm to cancel the respiration and extract the heartbeat. To remove the interference in dynamic measurement, we build an IQ-based signal model via a Principal Component Analysis-based interference estimation. To reduce the statistical error in HRV extraction, we further design a neural network to predict the HRV index. We have implemented a system prototype in a real environment with COTS RFID devices. Extensive experiments show that our system can achieve a median RMSSD error of 7.51 ms, which satisfies the medical demand in HRV measurement.},

abstract = {Effective patient-provider communication is crucial in clinical care, directly impacting patient outcomes and quality of life. Traditional evaluation methods, such as human ratings, patient feedback, and provider self-assessments, are often limited by high costs and scalability issues. Although existing natural language processing (NLP) techniques show promise, they struggle with the nuances of clinical communication and require sensitive clinical data for training, reducing their effectiveness in real-world applications. Emerging large language models (LLMs) offer a new approach to assessing complex communication metrics, with the potential to advance the field through integration into passive sensing and just-in-time intervention systems. This study explores LLMs as evaluators of palliative care communication quality, leveraging their linguistic, in-context learning, and reasoning capabilities. Specifically, using simulated scripts crafted and labeled by healthcare professionals, we test proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4) and fine-tune open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA2) with a synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4 to evaluate clinical conversations, to identify key metrics such as ‘understanding’ and ‘empathy’. Our findings demonstrated LLMs’ superior performance in evaluating clinical communication, providing actionable feedback with reasoning, and demonstrating the feasibility and practical viability of developing in-house LLMs. This research highlights LLMs’ potential to enhance patient-provider interactions and lays the groundwork for downstream steps in developing LLM-empowered clinical health systems.},

abstract = {Physical therapy exercises are critically important for the rehabilitation of patients with motor deficits. While these exercises can be most effective when performed properly under the supervision of a physical therapist, it may not be a viable option for all patients. Thus, there is a growing trend towards at-home physical rehabilitation tracking systems as they can be more accessible and flexible for patients. However, existing systems mostly depend on camera and wearable based solutions, which can be costly and limited. To this end, we propose a low-cost and non-intrusive end-to-end solution using IoT-based wireless sensing devices. Our solution, Wi-PT-Hand, leverages Channel State Information (CSI) captured from ambient WiFi signals and uses Bayesian optimizers and a hierarchical deep learning model trained to recognize the prescribed hand exercises. The proposed system includes (i) segmentation of the therapy time into activity and non-activity durations, (ii) recognition of the exercise performed in an activity segment, and (iii) counting of the number of repetitions of the exercise performed within that segment. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed system is robust and performs well in various real life scenarios, and thanks to the lightweight design it can work on low-resource edge devices properly.},

In addition, the simulation results are interpreted with specific cases. The results of the study show that: High levels of sensing capability do not have a significant positive effect on performance, while relatively low levels of sensing capability have a significant positive effect on performance. Seizing capability has a significant positive effect on performance. A certain range level of reconfiguring capability has a significant positive effect on performance, while reconfiguring capability beyond a certain range level has a significant negative effect on performance due to cost constraints.

This study primarily focuses on cost-sensitive small and medium-sized cloud application providers and explores how they can optimize their service procurement strategies to maximize the profits and cloud resource efficiency. By combining stochastic programming with newsboy model, we delve into the optimal selection strategy when faced with heterogeneous cloud resource providers. According to this analysis result, we design a service provider selection and composition algorithm based on break-even point rate to determine the allocation of resources from each cloud resource provider. The research findings indicate that startup or smaller-scale enterprises with limited costs are more inclined towards selecting only a mature and stable cloud service providers to mitigate operational risks and reduce expenses; whereas businesses experiencing stable growth but higher costs tend to prefer multiple high-quality cloud service providers for composition in order to achieve maximum returns, thereby enhancing competitiveness while improving service levels and customer experience.

However, existing methods lack thorough analysis of their suitability for IoT, given the limited energy, connectivity, and hardware capabilities of these devices. This paper presents a performance analysis of a hybrid self-sufficient coverless video steganography (HCVSteg) method, tested with Raspberry Pi 3 Model B nodes over a wireless network using the HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets. The HCVSteg method demonstrated exceptional efficiency, using 97.35\% less CPU and less than 2\% of memory compared to state-of-the-art lightweight security algorithms while accelerating encoding and decoding by 51\% and 60\%, respectively. The novel synthesis scheme reduced computational demands related to missing byte sequences. Moreover, the method consumed only 0.01W, making it 37 to 1,677 times more energy-efficient than comparable algorithms. Transmission rate improved by 6\%, latency decreased by 6\%, and the method added a minimal overhead of 100B for retrieval information. These results emphasize the method's suitability in resource-constrained environments like IoT, where speed, reliability, and energy efficiency are critical.},

Ajna addresses technical challenges in Augmented Reality (AR) devices, specifically the limitations of depth sensors and cameras. These limitations confine object detection to close proximity and hinder perception beyond immediate surroundings, through obstructions, or across different structural levels, impacting collaborative use. It harnesses the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in AR devices to measure users’ relative distances from a set physical point, enabling object detection sharing among multiple users across obstacles like walls and over distances. We tested Ajna’s effectiveness in a controlled study with 15 participants simulating emergency situations in a multi-story building. We found that Ajna improved object detection, location awareness, and situational awareness and reduced search times by 15\%. Ajna’s performance in simulated environments highlights the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance sensemaking in critical situations, offering insights for law enforcement, search and rescue, and infrastructure management.},

This paper investigates the extent to which security and privacy play a role in users’ decisions to retire home IoT devices. Through an online questionnaire administered to 195 users, we seek to understand motivations and behaviours surrounding disposal of IoT devices. We find that security is not a direct motivator for owners to cease using IoT devices of all types; in many cases loss of functionality is a greater motivator to dispose of a device.

abstract = {With the global aging population on the rise, fall-related injuries among the elderly pose significant health risks, making timely and accurate fall detection crucial. Traditional fall detection methods, including wearable sensors, ambient sensors, and camera-based systems, often face limitations such as user compliance, limited coverage, and privacy concerns. This paper proposes a novel human fall detection method utilizing a smart floor system that employs sensors combining capacitance and inductance. These sensors capture electrical properties data, which is then processed using data processing and analysis techniques to accurately detect and differentiate between various human postures such as standing, sitting, and lying down. This system addresses the shortcomings of existing technologies by providing comprehensive coverage without the need for user-worn devices and operates effectively irrespective of environmental conditions. By integrating this system into everyday environments, we can significantly enhance the safety and independence of the elderly, offering a reliable and cost-effective solution for fall detection.},

abstract = {Moxibustion is a traditional Chinese external therapy known for its remarkable efficacy in preventing and treating various diseases. However, traditional moxibustion has several drawbacks, such as labor intensity, environmental pollution, and the risk of skin burns. To address these issues, new modern navel therapy devices have been developed. These modern devices, based on the integration of traditional Chinese medicine theory with computer and sensor technologies, offer advantages like ease of operation, no pollution, temperature and time control, portability, and lightweight design, positioning them as a modern upgrade to traditional moxibustion. This study focuses on developing an electronic navel moxibustion device based on the traditional medicine-separated moxibustion method (navel therapy). The key findings of this research are as follows:The intelligent navel therapy device integrates PID layered control algorithms and a thermal equilibrium structure design. The PID control algorithm enables precise control of the burning moxa column in a confined space with complex multi-physics field environmental parameters. The intelligent navel therapy device is equipped with a remote data collection system based on 5G and GPRS networks, allowing real-time transmission of collected data to a monitoring center's database server. This enables treatment monitoring, therapeutic effect analysis, digital diagnosis assistance, and case tracking. The product uses high-precision skin temperature sensors to accurately collect temperature data from four points around the Shenque acupoint (above, below, left, and right). Based on the collected parameters and symptoms, in combination with doctors' instructions, the device automatically controls the temperature around the acupoint and the moxa burning time during the treatment.},

abstract = {Early detection of skin diseases is essential for improving patient survival rates and preventing serious harm to people's lives and health. In recent years, there have been advancements in the field of skin disease identification using artificial intelligence, particularly through algorithms like deep learning. Scientists have developed a series of skin disease diagnostic systems that can assist clinical doctors in quickly and effectively identifying and diagnosing different types of skin diseases. In this study, we selected and trained a deep learning network (MobileNetV2) and introduced a weighted cross-entropy loss function to address class imbalance in classification tasks, improving sensitivity to minority classes. Testing over 25,000 skin disease images, the results validated the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method, achieving an 84.7\% classification accuracy on eight categories in the combined dataset, which is highly acceptable. This method is expected to help dermatologists make more accurate clinical diagnoses in the future, potentially reducing the number of skin disease patients.},
