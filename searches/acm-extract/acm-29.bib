abstract = {As the building ages, the wall structure may become deteriorated (e.g., wall cracks, discontinuities, and corrosion) due to the variation of the environment (i.e., temperature and humidity). Moreover, these wall cracks, discontinuities, and corrosion will affect the living comfort and coziness. As such, the wall health diagnostic becomes crucial for the safety and comfort of modern buildings. However, the existing wall health detection techniques (e.g., UWB radars, acoustic sensing, and sensor embedding techniques) are high-cost, not ubiquitous, and not robust to the variation of the environment.In this article, we propose VibWall, a system that can use the smartphone’s sensors (i.e., accelerometer, gyroscope, and vibrator) to detect the wall’s structural health. Specifically, the wall cracks can be detected for living safety, comfort, and coziness. Our key idea is that the smartphone’s vibration is absorbed, reflected, and propagated disparately based on the physical structure of the wall. To be specific, we employ a novel challenge-response scheme, where the challenge is a sequence of heterogeneous vibration patterns from the smartphone’s vibrator, and the responses to these vibrations are sensed by the smartphone’s gyroscope and accelerometer sensors. Then, the machine learning-based classifier (e.g., random forest classifier) will be used to discriminate between the healthy wall and the wall with cracks, discontinuities, or corrosion based on these responses. Our experimental results show good performance on the wall’s structural health detection with the wall specimen and real-world walls.},

We introduce a wearable sanitary napkin sensor system to explore discharge bodily fluid volume measurement opportunities in the wild. We use this system to understand the impact of body parameters and activities on the sensing system, such as standing, sitting, walking, and lying down. We identified several engineering, methodological, and ethical challenges associated with wearable intimate device design. Our discussions contribute to an ongoing dialogue around women’s health in HCI and the barriers to personal care technology design. Through four-hour-long user studies with 10 participants on different activities, we showed that the sensing system behaves uniformly for all activities and across users. Using feedback interviews with participants, we find that our system is comfortable for performing activities and valuable technology for females.},

abstract = {The popularity of health and well-being applications is on the rise. These applications often collect and process personal and sensitive information about individuals for different purposes. Nonetheless, users’ freedom of choice around protection and sharing may be compromised, for example, by forwarding such information to third parties without user awareness or control, especially with current developments in AI-based complex data processing technologies. Despite the popularity of health and well-being applications, the purpose of sharing and its interplay with trust, privacy concerns, and their antecedents is seldom explored. The present article addresses this gap by conducting an online study (N = 315), which shows that, generally, people’s sharing preferences depend on their trust and privacy concerns. However, the findings indicate potential differences between male and female participants considering sharing information for the greater good, such as scientific research. Our findings are discussed in light of sociocultural and social role theories of prosocial behavior and previous research. Considering the growing interest in building usable infrastructures for data sharing and user empowerment, practical implications for designers and policymakers are highlighted.},

abstract = {This article investigates prediction of Quality of Experience (QoE) by comparing borrowing-from-neighbor situations and isolated ones. We demonstrate that joint utilization of multiple QoE measures enhances the accuracy of QoE prediction compared to that by a collection of individual QoE measures each regressed on Quality of Service (QoS) parameters, while the accuracy improvement with additional usage of QoS information in the former is limited. As an example of system that needs multidimensional QoE representation, the article gives haptic audiovisual interactive communications. We employ QoE and QoS data taken previously in an experiment, where 13 QoE measures (a five-point score each) and 12 QoS parameters (nonnegative continuous values each) are available at three average rates of load traffic. We build two kinds of Bayesian models for QoE prediction; one is a logistic regression model of a single QoE measure as the response variable and QoS parameters as predictors, which is a typical traditional method of discrete QoE prediction and isolated in a sense. The other is a structural equation model (SEM) with latent constructs (i.e., factors) of audiovisual quality, haptic quality, and user experience quality; the original SEM, which contains only QoE indicators of three constructs (audiovisual quality (AVQ), haptic quality (HQ), and user experience quality (UXQ)), was proposed in one of the author’s previous studies. This article extends the SEM to accommodate QoS parameters. We develop two kinds of new SEMs with QoS parameters: One has three extended constructs referred to as eAVQ, eHQ, and eUXQ, each of which has both QoE and QoS indicators, and the other has separate constructs for QoE and QoS, which lead to totally six constructs (AVqoe, Hqoe, UXqoe, AVqos, Hqos, and UXqos). We performed Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation of the Bayesian models with the JAGS software in an R environment. For comparison of QoE prediction accuracy, we adopt the 10-fold cross validation method and in part widely applicable information criterion. We then found that the three-construct models outperform the logistic regression models with respect to all subjective QoE measures and that the two kinds of the models are comparable as for the objective measure. The six-construct model exhibits almost the same accuracy as that of the three-construct one unless the number of QoE measures (nqoe) in the model is small. When the number nqoe is small, single-construct models may be a better choice. We have thus learned that multiple QoE measures should be utilized jointly (i.e., borrowing from neighbor) in QoE prediction rather than resorting to QoS information only.},

Understanding the context of takeover can facilitate the development of driver monitoring systems that can adapt to changing environments for more contextually appropriate assistance during takeover. The paper presents a hierarchical clustering analysis of hundreds of post-takeover vehicle kinematics in the MIT-AVT naturalistic driving study. Results show similar types of takeovers between Super Cruise and Autopilot: normal takeover, braking takeover, accelerating takeover, evasive-manoeuvre takeover, and right-swerve takeover (Autopilot only). Context analysis showed that braking takeover which occurred at a normal highway speed was often associated with upcoming highway exits and foreseeable low-speed situations, while accelerating, evasive-manoeuvre, and right-swerve takeovers were caused by strong brake (for Super Cruise) or large steering (for Autopilot) during slow car following. The findings indicate the potential for sensor-based approaches to assessing various contexts and facilitating a more holistic takeover reference model.},

Previous research required complex medical-grade equipment to collect physiological data, limiting real-world applicability. To overcome this, we present SensCon for skin conductance and heart rate data acquisition. To identify the optimal sensor location in the controller, we conducted a first study investigating users' controller grasp behavior. In a second study, we evaluated the performance of SensCon against medical-grade devices in six scenarios regarding user experience and signal quality. Users subjectively preferred SensCon in terms of usability and user experience. Moreover, the signal quality evaluation showed satisfactory accuracy across static, dynamic, and cognitive scenarios. Therefore, SensCon reduces the complexity of capturing and adapting the environment via real-time physiological data. By open-sourcing SensCon, we enable researchers and practitioners to adapt their virtual reality environment effortlessly. Finally, we discuss possible use cases for virtual reality-embedded physiological sensing.},

abstract = {The deployment and management of distributed latency-sensitive applications pose significant challenges due to the volatile nature of modern Internet of Things (IoT) edge networks, constrained resources for heterogeneous edge devices, and the increasingly demanding user requirements for service level agreement (SLA) and quality of service (QoS). To address these challenges, Kubernetes (k8s) orchestration platform has emerged, with previous research using heuristics to make scheduling decisions quickly or leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to adapt to changing circumstances. However, the former often struggle to adapt to highly dynamic and resource-competitive edge environments, while the latter’s long decision latency negatively impacts QoS. In this paper, we propose NeiLatS, a heterogeneous cloud-edge cluster scheduling system that addresses these issues. NeiLatS can monitor real-time resource and communication link conditions and make the scheduler latency-aware and location-aware. Additionally, we innovatively propose an efficacy coefficient method with tolerance factor ε (ε -ECM), which fully accounts for multi-resource load balancing, network stability, and future communication link conditions to resolve the conflict between resource utilization balance and QoS. We test NeiLatS on physical clusters and compare it with five different algorithms. Our evaluation results show a 4.59\%-16\% improvement in resource load balancing degree, a 41.95\%-82.85\% reduction in SLA violation rates, and a 1-5x improvement in QoS, which greatly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

abstract = {Wearable devices have been important components for ubiquitous computing. However, text input remains challenging on wearables due to the lack of a physical keyboard. In this paper, we propose a novel ring-shaped virtual keyboard system named RingVKB for convenient text input using low-cost IMUs available on any wearables. At the core of RingVKB are two novel designs: 1) A circular keyboard layout with 12 equal sectors, which assembles all common keys on classical keyboards while allowing users to type with only one finger effectively, and 2) an error control algorithm that calculates the relative displacement of keystrokes from the noisy IMU sensor data. The two components, coupled together, enable high-accuracy and efficient text input for ubiquitous scenarios.We implement RingVKB using a small device consisting of a microcontroller and a MEMS sensor, which can be attached to the user's index finger.Experimental results show that RingVKB can effectively improve the relative displacement estimation accuracy, and achieves an overall keystroke recognition accuracy of 93\% for 25 key positions. A user study also shows that RingVKB is easy to learn and use. Using only low-cost IMU sensors, RingVKB provides a virtual keyboard solution that can be widely adopted on wearables.},

abstract = {Wearable devices allow quick and convenient interactions for controlling mobile computers. However, these interactions are often device-dependent, and users cannot control devices in a way they are familiar with if they do not wear the same wearable device. This paper proposes a new method, UnifiedSense, to enable device-dependent gestures even when the device that detects such gestures is missing by utilizing sensors on other wearable devices. UnifiedSense achieves this without explicit gesture training for different devices, by training its recognition model while users naturally perform gestures. The recognizer uses the gestures detected on the primary device (i.e., a device that reliably detects gestures) as labels for training samples and collects sensor data from all other available devices on the user. We conducted a technical evaluation with data collected from 15 participants with four types of wearable devices. It showed that UnifiedSense could correctly recognize 5 gestures (5 gestures \texttimes{} 5 configurations) with an accuracy of 90.9\% (SD = 1.9\%) without the primary device present.},

abstract = {Trusted execution environment (TEE) technology has found many applications in mitigating various security risks in an efficient manner, which is attractive for critical infrastructure protection. First, the natural of critical infrastructure requires it to be well protected from various cyber attacks. Second, performance is usually important for critical infrastructure and it cannot afford an expensive protection mechanism. While a large number of TEE-based critical infrastructure protection systems have been proposed to address various security challenges (e.g., secure sensing and reliable control), most existing works ignore one important feature, i.e., devices comprised the critical infrastructure may be equipped with multiple incompatible TEE technologies and belongs to different owners. This feature makes it hard for these devices to establish mutual trust and form a unified TEE environment. To address these challenges and fully unleash the potential of TEE technology for critical infrastructure protection, we propose DHTee, a decentralized coordination mechanism. DHTee uses blockchain technology to support key TEE functions in a heterogeneous TEE environment, especially the attestation service. A Device equipped with one TEE can interact securely with the blockchain to verify whether another potential collaborating device claiming to have a different TEE meets the security requirements. DHTee is also flexible and can support new TEE schemes without affecting devices using existing TEEs that have been supported by the system.},

abstract = {Microwave radars bring many benefits to mid-air gesture sensing due to their large field of view and independence from environmental conditions, such as ambient light and occlusion. However, radar signals are highly dimensional and usually require complex deep learning approaches. To understand this landscape, we report results from a systematic literature review of (N=118) scientific papers on radar sensing, unveiling a large variety of radar technology of different operating frequencies and bandwidths and antenna configurations but also various gesture recognition techniques. Although highly accurate, these techniques require a large amount of training data that depend on the type of radar. Therefore, the training results cannot be easily transferred to other radars. To address this aspect, we introduce a new gesture recognition pipeline that implements advanced full-wave electromagnetic modeling and inversion to retrieve physical characteristics of gestures that are radar independent, i.e., independent of the source, antennas, and radar-hand interactions. Inversion of radar signals further reduces the size of the dataset by several orders of magnitude, while preserving the essential information. This approach is compatible with conventional gesture recognizers, such as those based on template matching, which only need a few training examples to deliver high recognition accuracy rates. To evaluate our gesture recognition pipeline, we conducted user-dependent and user-independent evaluations on a dataset of 16 gesture types collected with the Walabot, a low-cost off-the-shelf array radar. We contrast these results with those obtained for the same gesture types collected with an ultra-wideband radar made of a vector network analyzer with a single horn antenna and with a computer vision sensor, respectively. Based on our findings, we suggest some design implications to support future development in radar-based gesture recognition.},

abstract = {Higher levels of automated driving also require a more sophisticated environmental perception. Therefore, an increasing number of sensors transmit their data samples as frame bursts to other applications for further processing. As a vehicle has to react to its environment in time, such data is subject to safety-critical latency constraints. To keep up with the resulting data rates, there is an ongoing transition to a Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)-based communication backbone. However, the use of TSN-related industry standards does not match the automotive requirements of large timely sensor data transmission, nor it offers benefits on time-critical transmissions of single control data packets. By using the full data rate of prioritized IEEE 802.1Q Ethernet, giving time guarantees on large data samples is possible, but with strongly degraded results due to data collision. Resolving such collisions with time-aware shaping comes with significant overhead. Hence, rather than optimizing the parameters of the existing protocol, we propose a system design that synchronizes the transmission times of sensor data samples. This limits network protocol complexity and hardware requirements by avoiding tight time synchronization and time-aware shaping. We demonstrate that individual sensor data samples are transmitted without significant interference, exclusively at full Ethernet data rate. We provide a synchronous event model together with a straightforward response time analysis for synchronous multi-frame sample transmissions. The results show that worst-case latencies of such sample communication, in contrast to non-synchronized approaches, are close to their theoretical minimum as well as to simulative results while keeping the overall network utilization high.},

abstract = {Healthcare is a pivotal research field, and medical imaging is crucial in many applications. Therefore finding new architectural and algorithmic solutions would benefit highly repetitive image processing procedures. One of the most complex tasks in this sense is image registration, which finds the optimal geometric alignment among 3D image stacks and is widely employed in healthcare and robotics. Given the high computational demand of such a procedure, hardware accelerators are promising real-time and energy-efficient solutions, but they are complex to design and integrate within software pipelines. Therefore, this work presents an automation framework called Hephaestus that generates efficient 3D image registration pipelines combined with reconfigurable accelerators. Moreover, to alleviate the burden from the software, we codesign software-programmable accelerators that can adapt at run-time to the image volume dimensions. Hephaestus features a cross-platform abstraction layer that enables transparently high-performance and embedded systems deployment. However, given the computational complexity of 3D image registration, the embedded devices become a relevant and complex setting being constrained in memory; thus, they require further attention and tailoring of the accelerators and registration application to reach satisfactory results. Therefore, with Hephaestus, we also propose an approximation mechanism that enables such devices to perform the 3D image registration and even achieve, in some cases, the accuracy of the high-performance ones. Overall, Hephaestus demonstrates 1.85\texttimes{} of maximum speedup, 2.35\texttimes{} of efficiency improvement with respect to the State of the Art, a maximum speedup of 2.51\texttimes{} and 2.76\texttimes{} efficiency improvements against our software, while attaining state-of-the-art accuracy on 3D registrations.},

abstract = {Human activity recognition&nbsp;(HAR) is an important component in a number of health applications, including rehabilitation, Parkinson’s disease, daily activity monitoring, and fitness monitoring. State-of-the-art HAR approaches use multiple sensors on the body to accurately identify activities at runtime. These approaches typically assume that data from all sensors are available for runtime activity recognition. However, data from one or more sensors may be unavailable due to malfunction, energy constraints, or communication challenges between the sensors. Missing data can lead to significant degradation in the accuracy, thus affecting quality of service to users. A common approach for handling missing data is to train classifiers or sensor data recovery algorithms for each combination of missing sensors. However, this results in significant memory and energy overhead on resource-constrained wearable devices. In strong contrast to prior approaches, this paper presents a clustering-based approach&nbsp;(CIM) to impute missing data at runtime. We first define a set of possible clusters and representative data patterns for each sensor in HAR. Then, we create and store a mapping between clusters across sensors. At runtime, when data from a sensor are missing, we utilize the stored mapping table to obtain most likely cluster for the missing sensor. The representative window for the identified cluster is then used as imputation to perform activity classification. We also provide a method to obtain imputation-aware activity prediction sets to handle uncertainty in data when using imputation. Experiments on three HAR datasets show that CIM achieves accuracy within 10\% of a baseline without missing data for one missing sensor when providing single activity labels. The accuracy gap drops to less than 1\% with imputation-aware classification. Measurements on a low-power processor show that CIM achieves close to 100\% energy savings compared to state-of-the-art generative approaches.},

abstract = {In wearable optical sensing applications whose target tissue is not superficial, such as deep tissue oximetry, the task of embedded system design has to strike a balance between two competing factors. On one hand, the sensing task is assisted by increasing the radiated energy into the body, which in turn, improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the deep tissue at the sensor. On the other hand, patient safety consideration imposes a constraint on the amount of radiated energy into the body. In this paper, we study the trade-offs between the two factors by exploring the design space of the light source activation pulse.Furthermore, we propose BASS, an algorithm that leverages the activation pulse design space exploration, which further optimizes deep tissue SNR via spectral averaging, while ensuring the radiated energy into the body meets a safe upper bound. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is demonstrated via analytical derivations, simulations, and in vivo measurements in both pregnant sheep models and human subjects.},

abstract = {Confidential Computing (CC) fundamentally improves our security posture by drastically reducing the attack surface of systems. While traditional systems encrypt data at rest and in transit, CC extends this protection to data in use. It provides a novel, clearly defined security boundary, isolating sensitive data within trusted execution environments during computation. This means services can be designed that segment data based on least-privilege access principles, while all other code in the system sees only encrypted data. Crucially, the isolation is rooted in novel hardware primitives, effectively rendering even the cloud-hosting infrastructure and its administrators incapable of accessing the data. This approach creates more resilient systems capable of withstanding increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, thereby reinforcing data protection and sovereignty in an unprecedented manner.},

abstract = {Presently, metaverse technology as a three-dimensional virtual world has many benefits, especially in promoting collaboration and trusting relationships between partners. Therefore, it hints at the potential application in supply chain resilience. Given the outbreak of COVID-19, face-to-face communication has been very difficult to achieve, and opportunistic behaviour, fake information, etc., lead to a lack of transparency in the supply chain. These factors have resulted in the destruction of collaboration between supply chain partners, making it difficult to build a resilient supply chain. In this context, the metaverse provides an effective solution in fostering collaboration based on trust between partners, further promoting supply chain resilience. However, there is still a lack of evidence explaining why the metaverse has positive efficiency in this respect. Therefore, this study aims to fill this gap. A systematic literature review was conducted, and 18 relevant papers were analysed. We have identified the technology trends in virtual environments. Collaboration based on trust can be achieved in the metaverse. We also find key factors when the metaverse facilitates collaboration based on trust among supply chain partners to improve supply chain resilience, i.e., the role of sensory feedback. This paper is the first attempt to apply metadata in supply chain resilience. At the same time, it provides new solutions for managers in applying technologies to improve supply chain resilience. The main research limitation is the lack of an empirical analysis of the relationship among the metaverse, supply chain resilience, and sensory feedback. Research efforts should be geared towards developing a theoretical model for this relationship based on empirical analysis.},

However, collecting and sharing this data comes with significant risks, including hacking attacks, breaches of sensitive data, and non-compliance with privacy regulations. This paper proposes a comprehensive, end-to-end secure system, MOZAIK, for privacy-preserving data collection, analysis, and sharing to address these challenges. We perform a requirements analysis from the perspectives of security, privacy, legal, and functionality, highlighting the various mechanisms employed to safeguard sensitive data throughout the entire data cycle. This includes the use of lightweight encryption, distributed computation, and anonymous communication mechanisms to reduce security and privacy risks and to protect against single points of failure. MOZAIK provides a trusted and secure platform for data sharing and processing that can enable the creation of a data market and data economy.},

Muscle imbalance occurs when there is a strength disparity between muscles on one side of the body or one side of a joint. The proposed device detects asymmetries in exercises involving the lower limbs, employing two slim insoles equipped with only three pressure sensors positioned along the foot, one on the heel and two in the front. The data collected by these sensors are wirelessly transmitted to a user-friendly interface, which serves as a guide, assisting users in achieving more balanced and symmetrical training, important for maintaining musculoskeletal health and enhancing overall physical well-being. The paper presents an analysis of relevant literature, introduces the device and its characteristics, and presents the physical prototype and its experimental results.},

To address the issue of abnormal value errors such as high noise and UWB jitter value when tracking and locating mobile IoT devices in complicated indoor environments, this paper proposes to use a hybrid filtering weighted following algorithm based on UWB, which combines the benefits and drawbacks of Gaussian, median, and average filtering techniques, introduces the residual value of ranging, and combines geometric positioning to determine the ideal following value. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively filter out the UWB error under multi-factor interference and finally estimate the UWB value closest to the actual value, thereby improving the stability and sensitivity of the following process and obtaining a better follow effect.},

abstract = {In the present era of advanced technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) plays a crucial role in enabling smart connected environments. This includes various domains such as smart homes, smart healthcare, smart cities, smart vehicles, and many others. The IoT facilitates the integration and interconnection of devices, enabling them to communicate, share data, and work together to create intelligent and efficient systems. With ubiquitous smart connected devices and systems, a large amount of data associated with them is at a prime risk from malicious entities (e.g., users, devices, applications) in these systems. Innovative technologies, including cloud computing, Machine Learning (ML), and data analytics, support the development of anomaly detection models for the Vehicular Internet of Things (V-IoT), which encompasses collaborative automatic driving and enhanced transportation systems. However, traditional centralized anomaly detection models fail to provide better services for connected vehicles due to issues such as high latency, privacy leakage, performance overhead, and model drift.Recently, Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant recognition for its ability to address data privacy concerns in the IoT domain. In the context of V-IoT, which involves autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems with connected vehicles communicating with various sensors and devices, FL is used to develop an anomaly detection model. Current technology, the Digital Twin (DT), proves beneficial in addressing uncertain crises and data security issues by creating a virtual replica that simulates various factors, including traffic trajectories, city policies, and vehicle utilization. This enables the system to facilitate efficient and inclusive decision-making. However, the effectiveness of a V-IoT DT system heavily relies on the collection of long-term and high-quality data to make appropriate decisions. Consequently, its advantages may be limited when confronted with urgent crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.This paper introduces a Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) based anomaly detection model for V-IoT, aiming to enhance the accuracy of the model. Our proposed model integrates both DT and HFL approaches to create a comprehensive system for detecting malicious activities using an anomaly detection model. Additionally, real-world V-IoT use case scenarios are presented to demonstrate the application of the proposed model.},

To achieve this aim, a dedicated platform for environmentally sustainable and climate-resilient forest management has been developed with the help of many state-of-the-art, modern technologies. One of the major challenges to solve when building such a heterogeneous, multi-component, multipurpose platform is to provide the necessary security architecture. It should ensure that only trusted users and devices (e.g., sensors, drones, UGVs, etc.) would be allowed to use it, and attackers or other third parties would not jeopardize its communication and assets. In this paper, we outline the main design principles, solutions, and mechanisms we have considered when building the security architecture for the SILVANUS platform. Moreover, we present the current state of development of this platform and the main challenges we have been facing.},

abstract = {The rapid development of media technology has brought subversive changes to the traditional way of information dissemination, while reshaping the pattern of information dissemination and media ecology. In particular, the rapid development and popularization of mobile internet technology has enabled the public to communicate and interact in various forms, such as video, text and image, without time and space constraints. In the era of mobile internet, the speed of information acquisition has been accelerating, and the diversity of information content and access ways have provided more opportunities for the public to choose, and also posed new challenges for ideological and political education. The use of mobile internet intelligent teaching tools can effectively solve the pain points and difficulties of traditional ideological and political teaching in the aspects of teacher-student interaction, flipped teaching, precise teaching analysis, etc., which is conducive to creating a teaching platform of new media ideological and political education with the characteristics of the times, and enhancing the sense of the times and attraction of ideological and political classes in colleges and universities. At present, China is actively carrying out the reform of ideological and political classes in colleges and universities. One of the main contents of this work is to promote the integration of modern mobile internet technology and ideological and political theory classes, realize the innovation of teaching mode, and highlight the modern teaching concept, which has become the quality required by the majority of ideological and political teachers in colleges and universities.},

abstract = {Machine learning models trained with passive sensor data from mobile devices can be used to perform various inferences pertaining to activity recognition, context awareness, and health and well-being. Prior work has improved inference performance through the use of multimodal sensors (inertial, GPS, proximity, app usage, etc.) or improved machine learning. In this context, a few studies shed light on critical issues relating to the poor cross-country generalization of models due to distributional shifts across countries. However, these studies have largely relied on inference performance as a means of studying generalization issues, failing to investigate whether the root cause of the problem is linked to specific sensor modalities (independent variables) or the target attribute (dependent variable). In this paper, we study this issue in complex activities of daily living (ADL) inference task, involving 12 classes, by using a multimodal, multi-country dataset collected from 689 participants across eight countries. We first show that the ‘country of origin’ of data is captured by sensors and can be inferred from each modality separately, with an average accuracy of 65\%. We then propose two diversity scores (DS) that measure how a country differentiates from others w.r.t. sensor modalities or activities. Using these diversity scores, we observed that both individual sensor modalities and activities have the ability to differentiate countries. However, while many activities capture country differences, only the ‘App usage’ and ‘Location’ sensors can do so. By dissecting country-level diversity across dependent and independent variables, we provide a framework to better understand model generalization issues across countries and country-level diversity of sensing modalities.},

abstract = {In recent years, Informational Technologies (IT) was massively deployed into Industrial Control Systems (ICS) mainly for its economic benefits. However, this new paradigm, converging IT and Operational Technologies (OT), brings new challenges that companies need to face. Historically, ICS had to cope with safety requirements which ensure the protection of people, environment, and assets. Now, ICS must deal with additional threats, coming from cyberattacks, in order to maintain safety. For that purpose, it becomes essential to develop new cybersecurity technologies and methodologies that allow to assess the safety of ICS against cyberattacks. In this paper, we propose a new methodology, based on Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) logic in order to identify cyberattacks that impacts the ICS safety. Our methodology transforms a PLC logic into a finite-state machine that represents the PLC behavior. Then, using this automaton, we identify which modifications in states of sensors and actuators leads to compromising the safety. Finally, we build attack scenarios from these events and the network vulnerabilities. We apply our methodology on a simple example, yet challenging to analyze by hand, and we show how we manage to scale up on a classical example from the control systems domain: the Tennessee Eastman chemical process.},

Human activity recognition within IoT-based smart homes can enable the detection of early health risks related to mild cognitive impairment by providing proactive measurements and interventions to both the elderly and supporting healthcare givers. In this paper, we developed and evaluated a Multivariate long short-term memory (LSTM) to learn to forecast activities of daily living and detect anomalous behaviour using motion sensor data in 6 single-resident smart homes of the elderly. We use Mahalanobis distance to identify anomalies based on distance scores to build thresholds. The model's performance in terms of NMAE error values ranges between 2\% and 6\%. The experimental results show that the performance of LSTM for predicting the direct next activity versus the multiple forecasts is close. The method could identify participants' changing health conditions through the used predictive model and unsupervised anomaly detection method.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor network (WSN) has many applications, such as, military scenarios, habitat monitoring and home security. In recent years, with the advancement of energy harvesting (EH) technology, nodes can obtain available energy from the surrounding environment for their own use, thus extending their lifetimes. Under these conditions, research aimed at improving the WSN lifecycle has further shifted towards improving the performance of the network, albeit subject to unique energy harvesting constraints. This paper proposes an energy prediction algorithm for the devices and an Energy and Density Adaptive Clustering (EDAC) protocol to improve network throughput and transmission ratio for EH-powered WSNs. Based on the EH characteristics, we first employed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) algorithm for energy prediction, then we divide the energy of the sensor nodes into three levels: low, medium, and high energy levels. At high energy levels, nodes can be selected as cluster head nodes, while at low energy levels, nodes must sleep and charge. EDAC first uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to dynamically cluster the surviving nodes in each round and sets a threshold to partition the clustering density. On this basis, a new adaptive cluster head election formula is proposed for cluster head election based on the energy levels of nodes, the predicted energy of the next stage, and the density of clusters. In the stable communication stage of the network, we introduce a "backup cluster head" to temporarily forward the remaining data packets within the cluster when the current cluster head expires. Our simulation results show that our algorithm significantly improves throughput and data transfer rate compared to the traditional and improved clustering protocols.},

abstract = {In the post-pandemic era, university students face a future replete with uncertainties, engendering significant challenges in both their academic and personal lives. The uncertain environment and continuous online learning may contribute to the prevalence of procrastination among students. Therefore, in this era, it is crucial for college students to have a sense of self-assurance and self-control. Based on self-regulation theory, this study examines the issue of procrastination among college students from a new perspective. A total of 756 university students were surveyed using the Self-Concept Clarity Scale, the Pure Procrastination Scale, the Brief Self-Control Scale, and the Brief Self-Handicapping Scale. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS 26.0 and AMOS 26.0, and a chain mediation model was established (Isolated the influence of control variables). Results indicate that students' self-concept clarity not only directly negatively predicts procrastination but also affects it through self-control, self-handicapping, and their chain-mediated effects, with self-handicapping having the greatest impact. These findings suggest that schools and educators should focus on developing college students' self-concept clarity to alleviate their procrastination behavior, which can be achieved by enhancing self-control and preventing self-handicapping. This study provides guidance for schools and educators on promoting college students' self-awareness and self-management, laying the foundation for future prevention and intervention of procrastination among university students.},

Key stakeholders are from various parties inclusive of material supplier, manufacturer, distribution center, regional hospital, provincial hospital, as well as patients. In this research, we examine the delivery-route decisions for last-mile delivery using a selective case study of transporting healthcare products to downstream points of consumption. Initially, the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Window (VRPTW) is developed. Then, in order to model the driver perspective to deliver healthcare products and to capture urgent needs of healthcare products under time constraints due to temperature control in the healthcare cold chain (HCC), the minimax objective is used as a surrogate objective function reflecting social perspective in this study. Then, a sensitivity analysis is performed to assess how changing the number of vehicles affects the model performance. Finally, the case study from the third-party logistics (3PL) company is used to verify and validate the model functionalities. Our initial study provides promising result and is subject to the on-going development of the healthcare cold chain optimization model in our research study.},

abstract = {Unfettered access to the Internet is unfortunately not universal —- studies show that more than half of the world’s population is subject to at least some censorship. Even in regions without censorship, Internet outages (e.g., during natural disasters) hinder the ability to communicate online. Avoiding censorship and communicating during Internet outages have inspired a number of proposals for communicating via a class of decentralized routing protocols based on sneakernets. In a sneakernet, messages are passed between human-carried devices (usually smartphones), completely avoiding the Internet. Importantly, the movement of messages in a sneakernet is dictated by the movements of the (human) device owners; these networks tend to be opportunistic in the sense that messages are exchanged between parties only when those parties encounter one another through happenstance. Understanding the security, performance, and privacy properties of various sneakernet protocols remains an open problem, with individual proposals inventing their own metrics and evaluation methodology, and is further challenged by a lack of unified evaluation and simulation frameworks. This paper presents Cadence, a simulator for decentralized human movement-based communication protocols that provides a unifying environment for evaluating sneakernet protocols under a variety of conditions. We describe the architecture of Cadence and argue its benefits to network and security researchers. Cadence is free open-source software.},

abstract = {E-health is the use of information and communication technology (ICT) for the healthcare-related services. It uses various types of digital technologies and telecommunications, such as computers, sensing devices, Internet, and mobile devices to deliver medical services. Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a communication environment optimized for low-power devices (for example, health sensors and actuators) and operation on, in, or around the human body (i.e., a patient). It can be used in various applications that are related to healthcare, such as “body automation,” “healthcare,” “medical monitoring,” “body interaction,” and “medical implants (i.e., pacemaker).” Most of the communications happen in IoMT-based e-healthcare system are wireless in nature. This may cause severe threats to the security of the system. Various information security-related attacks, i.e., replay, man-in-the-middle attack (MiTM), impersonation, privileged insider, unauthorised session key computation, credentials leakage, stolen verifier, malware injection are possible in IoMT-based e-healthcare system. These threats and attacks can create serious problems in the social life of an individual, as this may reveal their confidential healthcare information to other unauthorised parties. Therefore, it is essential to propose an access control and key management scheme to secure the communication of a IoMT-based e-healthcare system. Moreover, the security of such kind of scheme can also be enhanced through the deployment of a blockchain mechanism. Therefore, in this article, we propose a blockchain-enabled access control and key management protocol for IoMT-based e-healthcare system that is named as “BACKM-EHA” in short. The security analysis of proposed BACKM-EHA is also provided through the standard, i.e., “Real-Or-Random model.” The various conducted security analyses prove the security of BACKM-EHA against the different types of potential attacks. The performance of BACKM-EHA is better than the other existing schemes, as it requires less communication cost, computation cost, and provides more “security and functionality features.”},

abstract = {This paper studies the construction of accounting degree case base at home and abroad in the metauniverse era. Firstly, it analyses the significance of the construction of accounting degree case base. By the end of 2021, the number of master of professional accounting training institutions in China will have increased from 24 to 298. At the same time, it explains the connotation and main technology of meta-universe. Metacosmic technologies include 5G, 6G, cloud computing, edge computing, Internet of things, holographic projection, digital twinning, block chain, VR/AR/MR/XR and other technologies. Secondly, it analyses the development process and characteristics of Chicago case, Harvard case and Ivey case in Canada. The use of Harvard case allows to solve complex management problems compared to Chicago style. The 8-step strategy for case development at Ivey Business School in Canada includes three styles, two parts and seven parts of case writing. In 1998, the case of Ivey Business School Press has been distributed to more than 100 universities and enterprises in 20 countries. This paper analyses the shortcomings of case study courses and case construction of accounting major in China. Thirdly, this paper puts forward the enlightenment of foreign case teaching to the training of accounting talents: Based on the experience of case studies in developed countries, pay attention to the difference between accounting case teaching and accounting case teaching; advocate the general idea of "four-dimensional" accounting case development. Finally, the paper constructs the technical framework model of the construction of the case database of accounting professional degree in the meta-universe. The research conclusion shows that, under the background of meta-universe, the case database ecology of accounting professional database is built on the basis of meta-universe equipment and meta-universe underlying technology, to construct the ecological map of the original universe accounting case database, and on this basis to carry out the meta-universe accounting case database comprehensive intelligent analysis system, digital mining, case recommendation and other services. Improve the accounting professional database case use accuracy, enhance the sense of experience. The organic combination of meta-universe and accounting case database construction will inject new vitality into the teaching reform of professional degree postgraduates. The deep integration of foreign case study experience and meta-universe new technology will certainly bring about subversive changes in teaching research. Meta-universe can make contributions to accounting case teaching. Metauniverse changes the traditional accounting case teaching mode. Firstly, the application of meta-universe technology in accounting case teaching can enhance students' sense of teaching experience and give them an immersive feeling. Secondly, meta-universe technolog has also promoted the transformation of accounting case teaching from traditional teaching methods to information-based teaching methods. Accounting case teaching can not only simulate the offline teaching mode through metacosmic technology, but also use the characteristics of virtual world to completely change the teaching mode of accounting case teaching. By using meta-universe experiential accounting case teaching, we can improve the teaching effectiveness, solve the shortage of accounting case teachers, and meet the needs of students to learn accounting cases at any time.},

abstract = {Higher Education is constantly adapting to the needs of their stakeholders, which has led through time into the use of strategies such as Problem-Based Learning (PBL), Project-Oriented Learning (POL) and Research-Based Learning (RBL). These strategies have been widely used as they let students move from the theory they learn in class, into practical examples that make sense to students in relation to their future professional activity. Yet, educational centers keep on adapting and adopting more strategies that promote the development of competences among students. This is due to the need of employers to have professionals having the required skill sets to overcome the challenges of a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous environment. Thus, skillsets must not be limited to applying the knowledge they have, but also into giving them the tools to explore and understand alternatives outside their academic situations, by combining convergent and divergent thinking in a context that places them into the real-life situations they will be experiencing at work. Through this paper, we propose a methodology to adapt industrial needs into role-oriented learning.},

abstract = {This paper analyses the suitability of a Fuzzy Logic (FL) AI-trained machine learning model to assist IoT-based smart hydroponics for deployment with South African rural subsistence farmers. To answer these questions, a fuzzy logic model was developed to accurately determine and adjust outputs, based on inputs received from IoT sensors monitoring the nutrient solution and environment conditions in the hydroponics system. We conducted an initial evaluation of the FL-AI, followed by a real-world test based on an existing data set and finally conducted testing on simulated data to ensure that the AI can accurately determine crisp values to pass to a cloud based IoT platform accessed by a micro-controller which adjusts the environment variables of the hydroponics system. This approach was followed to ensure that we respect the time and availability of our research participants. We found that the system was able to accurately determine the necessary crisp values needed by the microcontroller. We further report on the suitability of FL-AI for rural subsistence farmers as the AI is less complex, reduces energy consumption, and resource waste, and the burden of manually monitoring and adjusting hydroponics systems, and is easy to use for first-time growers. We further discuss crucial lessons learned particularly in the South African and other Low to Middle Income Countries (LMIC) context, such as the necessity of solar power-enabled systems and local wifi networks rather than cloud-based IoT platforms.},

Here, we use an innovative location-based Bluetooth MESH to provide the IoT MESH system in the factory or at home, and use the Bluetooth broadcaster function as the main wireless transmission of the network. By receiving the acknowledgement packet and the positions of the relay nodes, it provides a first-in, first-out Queue and a Fast-Scan routing method for the transmission algorithm, which can achieve one-to-one and many-to-many routing. Multiple PUB/SUB two-way communication can be transmitted through the cloud as the center or decentralized. Basically, the BLE nodes in the field can communicate with each other, and the transmission delay is in the range of tens to hundreds of milliseconds. It can monitor the physiological condition of the wearable device on the mobile users, and can also control the position of personnel, and can graft the wired sensor already installed in the factory into our BLE MESH system. One example realized is to connect the Modbus communication to our system, and in the future LE audio can also come into our system when it is officially launched on the market},

abstract = {A fuzzy Logic System (FLS) has the unique potential of intelligent decision-making capability with the input data, which are imprecise and unpredictable but can be expressed using linguistic rules. However, such FLS strongly depends on the hardware architecture of the systems under consideration. A language called Fuzzy Markup Language (FML), which is based on XML, has the ability to express fuzzy systems without taking into account either hardware or software restrictions, thus enabling sharing effectively among distributed environments. FML creates a unified and clearly defined FLS that is independent of its previous representation. It also increases the capabilities of system designers by giving them access to a range of services that accelerate the process of creating a distributed or centralised fuzzy system. This can be done either through a centralised cloud-based platform or through a distributed cloud-based platform. FML-related software libraries, such as Simpful (a Python-based library) and Java FML (JFML, a Java-based library), have added to the novelty in it. However, JFML and Simpful enable fuzzy system modeling for programmers only in the abovementioned programming languages. Hence a need for the development of an open-source FLS which will be capable of enabling fuzzy system-based modelling is felt. The present communication introduces an enhancement of JFML through a visual environment based on GUI following IEEE Std 1855-2016. The functionalities of user-friendly visual FML are developed considering the data related to Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and other physiological data like SpO2 and pulse rate obtained from wearable sensors to compare the performances.},

As a consequence, online communication tools have become the primary mean for social interaction among people in quarantine. However, texts and other chatting tools do not adequately transmit the complex emotions hidden behind them. Without the stimulation of sensations from face-to-face communications, people hinder their ability to observe others’ emotions and feelings effectively. In this work, we propose a system that aims to improve emotional communication. We present Touch—a combination of a social media app and a wearable device that can receive and display multi-sensory feedback, including light, digital display, vibrations, and tactile interaction to transfer emotions. While the app encourages interaction between users through virtual spaces, the wearable device further enriches people's communication by offering another means to express emotions not afforded by virtual interactions. Together, these two elements of the Touch project offer a sounding solution to the problem of misunderstanding in communication.},

The smartphone can be considered both as a set of sensors and as an interface for the user. The European Horizon 2020 e-VITA project aims to promote active and healthy aging in senior populations. To this end, and thanks to Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), the current work is focused on the development of a virtual assistant to help the user in his daily tasks. One of the ICT used in this project is the smartphone. Indeed, the sensors of the smartphone make it possible to measure and reconstitute a part of the user’s context, thanks to the communication with a remote server. Moreover, this server is able to offer different services (including the fusion of different modalities) in order to reconstitute the context. The fusion of multimodal data implies in its turn different machine learning modules. Finally, in order to efficiently restore the context to the user and to dialogue with him, a chatbot module under the chatGPT model developed by openAI is integrated. The communication with the user will then be established in a textual or vocal way.},

abstract = {Robot teleoperation is an emerging field of study with wide applications in exploration, manufacturing, and healthcare, because it allows users to perform complex remote tasks while remaining distanced and safe. Haptic feedback offers an immersive user experience and expands the range of tasks that can be accomplished through teleoperation. In this paper, we present a novel wearable haptic feedback device for a teleoperation system that applies kinesthetic force feedback to the fingers of a user. The proposed device, called a ‘haptic muscle’, is a soft pneumatic actuator constructed from a fabric-silicone composite in a toroidal structure. We explore the requirements of the ideal haptic feedback mechanism, construct several haptic muscles using different materials, and experimentally determine their dynamic pressure response as well as sensitivity (their ability to communicate small changes in haptic feedback). Finally, we integrate the haptic muscles into a data glove and a teleoperation system and perform several user tests. Our results show that most users could detect detect force changes as low as 3\% of the working range of the haptic muscles. We also find that the haptic feedback causes users to apply up to 52\% less force on an object while handling soft and fragile objects with a teleoperation system.},

abstract = {Automated Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a crucial technology for Ambient Assisted Living applications (AAL), which uses sensor data to detect and recognize human activities and behaviors. However, this technology faces several challenges, such as coping with the inherent variability of human motions, the presence of multiple people, nuisance factors such as partial occlusion, changes in lighting or viewpoint, etc. The proposed research work of ACTIVE aims to address these challenges by developing a digital assistant capable of accurately recognizing a wide range of human activities by introducing new methods and technologies for dynamic, adaptive multimodal data fusion and analysis. Additionally, the research work focuses on the incorporation of a mobile robotic platform to assist in the monitoring of human activities in dynamic environments. The ultimate goal is to provide a better understanding of human behavior, improve quality of life, and enable personalized services for individuals.},

abstract = {Humans locate and track objects and other humans in their surroundings using audio, vision, or a combination of the two sensory modalities. A common strategy for humans searching for others in an indoor environment is to rely on a sound’s Direction of Arrival (DoA), as well as their knowledge of whether a room was previously occupied. In this paper, a similar search behavior is implemented on a mobile robot for the purpose of tracking other humans. To produce this search behavior, we develop an algorithm that performs probabilistic inference of human presence in a specific map region using two sensory cues: DoA of sound and a vision-based estimate of human proximity. A key characteristic of this approach is that the robot can navigate towards a human irrespective of whether the sound signal is continuous, sporadic, or absent altogether. We deploy the proposed search behavior on a robot and evaluate its efficacy at finding a target person across multiple rooms, considering varying levels of human sound (e.g., calling out occasionally, once, or not at all). Our experimental findings indicate that while audio signals are not vital in localizing the target person, they greatly reduce the search time.},

abstract = {Greenhouse horticulture's main purpose is to produce a comfortable indoor environment that encourages plant development. As a result, it promotes off-season crop farming and cultivation in areas where the natural environment is unsuitable for some types of flora. The proposed project in this study focuses on tomato cultivation where there is still minimal cultivation since the process is difficult to control and requires low temperatures, such as in some upland areas, to allow high quality and fast growth. Several essential characteristics that determine the quality of plant development and production, including as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and the amount of sunlight that penetrates the plant house, will be monitored, and managed automatically in this project. The temperature and humidity sensor (DHT11), soil moisture sensors (YL - 69), ultraviolet (UV) sensor, 12 V water pump, 12 V Peltier module with heatsink, 26 W LED plant grow strip lights, and switchable glass that blocks 98\% of UV rays are some of the most important components used in this study. According to the findings of the experiments, tomato plants cultivated with this prototype develop faster and healthier, even in high-temperature agricultural locations. Furthermore, this project can use IoT to control and safeguard tomato crops from being exposed to excessive ultraviolet radiation and pests by using applications installed on smart phones. Experimental results show that tomatoes grown in the suggested greenhouse system, the Smart Shaded Plant House, grow more quickly than tomatoes grown using traditional methods. By constantly monitoring these environmental variables, farmers can learn more about how each aspect affects growth and how to manage maximum crop productivity while growing certain vegetables and fruits in hot agricultural areas.},

abstract = {The ability to quickly obtain a comprehensive picture of the environment is an important prerequisite for the realization of robust and safe autonomous navigation with mobile robots. Due to their comparatively low computational requirements and cost, as well as their ability to provide omnidirectional perception, audio systems can be an excellent complement to more sophisticated or expensive sensing systems such as cameras or lidars. In this paper, we describe the development of a low-cost binaural audio system capable of interpreting the acoustic information present in an environment to assist a lidar system in making decisions that need to be made by a mobile robot. By taking advantage of the robot’s mobility, the system can resolve the uncertainties inherent in consciously choosing two off-the-shelf microphones and effectively realize 360-degree coverage. This opens up new possibilities, for example, to make room monitoring much more reliable.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressive, debilitating neurodegenerative disease which causes motor symptoms including gait dysfunction. Motor fluctuations are alterations between periods with a positive response to levodopa therapy ("on") and periods marked by re-emergency of PD symptoms ("off") as the response to medication wears off. These fluctuations often affect gait speed and they increase in their disabling impact as PD progresses. To improve the effectiveness of current indoor localisation methods, a transformer-based approach utilising dual modalities which provide complementary views of movement, Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and accelerometer data from wearable devices, is proposed. A sub-objective aims to evaluate whether indoor localisation, including its in-home gait speed features (i.e. the time taken to walk between rooms), could be used to evaluate motor fluctuations by detecting whether the person with PD is taking levodopa medications or withholding them. To properly evaluate our proposed method, we use a free-living dataset where the movements and mobility are greatly varied and unstructured as expected in real-world conditions. 24 participants lived in pairs (consisting of one person with PD, one control) for five days in a smart home with various sensors. Our evaluation on the resulting dataset demonstrates that our proposed network outperforms other methods for indoor localisation. The sub-objective evaluation shows that precise room-level localisation predictions, transformed into in-home gait speed features, produce accurate predictions on whether the PD participant is taking or withholding their medications.},

abstract = {Flow field reconstruction is a key task of aircraft sensing the external environment. Numerical methods like CFD are time-consuming and computationally expensive, so surrogate model-based methods are adopted in the task. However, most kinds of surrogate model only learn the mapping from the input space to the output space. Fourier neural operator (FNO) is a model structure that can learn from the functional input space to output functional space. This paper develops the FNO method to reconstruct the flow field around a wing using pressure sensor measurements on the wing surface. We carried out experiments to validate the developed method, and the result shows our method can achieve high accuracy and noise robustness.},
