abstract = {The merging of electronic materials and textiles has triggered the proliferation of wearables and interactive surfaces in the ubiquitous computing era. However, this leads to e-textile waste that is difficult to recycle and decompose. Instead, we demonstrate an eco-design approach to upcycle waste cotton fabrics into functional textile elements through carbonization without the need for additional materials. We identify optimal parameters for the carbonization process and develop encapsulation techniques to improve the response, durability, and washability of the carbonized textiles. We then configure these e-textiles into various 'design primitives' including sensors, interconnects, and heating elements, and evaluate their electromechanical properties against commercially available e-textiles. Using these primitives, we demonstrate several applications, including a haptic-transfer fabric, a joint-sensing wearable, and an intelligent sailcloth. Finally, we highlight how the sensors can be composted, re-carbonized and coated onto other fabrics, or repurposed into different sensors towards their end-of-life to promote a circular manufacturing process.},

abstract = {In vision-based object recognition systems, imaging sensors perceive the environment and then objects are detected and classified for decision-making purposes, e.g., to maneuver an automated vehicle around an obstacle or to raise alarms for intruders in surveillance settings. In this work we demonstrate how camera-based perception can be unobtrusively manipulated to enable an attacker to create spurious objects or alter an existing object, by remotely projecting adversarial patterns into cameras, exploiting two common effects in optical imaging systems, viz., lens flare/ghost effects and auto-exposure control. To improve the robustness of the attack, we generate optimal patterns by integrating adversarial machine learning techniques with a trained end-to-end channel model. We experimentally demonstrate our attacks using a low-cost projector on three different cameras, and under different environments. Results show that, depending on the attack distance, attack success rates can reach as high as 100\%, including under targeted conditions. We develop a countermeasure that reduces the problem of detecting ghost-based attacks into verifying whether there is a ghost overlapping with a detected object. We leverage spatiotemporal consistency to eliminate false positives. Evaluation on experimental data provides a worst-case equal error rate of 5\%.},

In this work, we will create an IoT-based air pollution monitoring system to detect the presence of dangerous chemicals in the environment, including carbon monoxide (CO), cigarette smoke, ethanol, benzene, and ammonia (NH3), anytime any of these parameters falls below a predefined threshold. Keeping tabs on the air quality with ease thanks to the LCD display and online data. The pollutant level can be tracked remotely through a computer or mobile device in this IoT project.

abstract = {Nowadays, healthcare is growing rapidly due to the significant progress made in new technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and wearable devices. These devices are widely used to ensure remote patient monitoring. Smart devices offer innovative and enhanced features in smart healthcare systems and, thus, store a large amount of patients' sensitive information. Initially, we collect data from smart health devices deployed with IoT sensors such as pressure, pulse, heart rate etc. By utilizing these devices, valuable health data is obtained, and can now be filtered, analysed, and stored in electronic health records (EHRs). Initially we use Data Augmentation Normalization Filtering (DANF) method to eliminate the null values and inconsistency values. The Attribute Scaling Effect Rate (ASER) method is used to identify the marginal values of the collected features. Then Sensitive Correlation Feature Selection (SCFS) approach is to identify the importance of sensitive term weight. The DSLDNN approach is used to classify sensitive and non-sensitive disease prediction terms based on selected features. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the various techniques in the cardiac dataset. The results of the experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms other previous techniques.},

Development aforesaid has potentially put forward an open challenge in terms of confidentiality, security, and integrity resulting in attacks be it physical or in online domain, more than ever owing to number of details and intricacies visible with ease. Potential threats to security have taken a new form aided with innovations in technology, which has boosted the need to upgrade and revamp counter systems to ensure optimal security and has also opened several potential research domains. Most of the existing surveillance systems are employed for investigations only after an incident has taken place and generally, inputs from cameras are monitored by human operators or stored for later use and are inspected if the need arises. With multiple inputs the task becomes too cumbersome, number of solutions have been proposed to address the issue, however a wide gap still exists. Work presents a framework for detecting suspicious vehicle movement, presence of unauthorized bunker, and suspicious human activity in military areas, employing data from remote sensing sites and ArcGIS an open platform for acquiring remote data. A data set of 1326 images were employed for the proposed work with 380 images for vehicle movement, 514 images for bunker detection, and 423 images for human activity. Input to proposed model is a combination of remote sensing and ArcGIS data. Model proposed classifies the data into groups as suspicious that needs attention and non-suspicious employing AI algorithms.

abstract = {Over 30 million people globally consume illicit opiates. In recent decades, Afghanistan has accounted for 70–90\% of the world’s illicit supply of opium. This production provides livelihoods to millions of Afghans, while also funneling hundreds of millions of dollars to insurgent groups every year, exacerbating corruption and insecurity, and impeding development. Remote sensing and field surveys are currently used in official estimates of total poppy cultivation area. These aggregate estimates are not suited to study the local socioeconomic conditions surrounding cultivation. Few avenues exist to generate comprehensive, fine-grained data under poor security conditions, without the use of costly surveys or data collection efforts. Here, we develop and test a new unsupervised approach to mapping cultivation using only freely available satellite imagery. For districts accounting for over 90\% of total cultivation, our aggregate estimates track official statistics closely (correlation coefficient of 0.76 to 0.81). We combine these predictions with other grid-level data sources, finding that areas with poppy cultivation have poorer outcomes such as infant mortality and education, compared to areas with exclusively other agriculture. Surprisingly, poppy-growing areas have better healthcare accessibility. We discuss these findings, the limitations of mapping opium poppy cultivation, and associated ethical concerns.},

This can detect stress from varying Heart Rates, validated by expensive commercial wearables. Between subject experiments on drivers (total n = 14 in two phases) with wearables, we also found that road factors are responsible for driving stress.

abstract = {Clock synchronization is an important challenge in the Internet of Things (IoT), especially for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). It refers to aligning the timekeeping of multiple devices or systems to a common reference time. It ensures the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, which are often used for critical applications, such as environmental monitoring or security. However, clock synchronization techniques can significantly impact sensor resources, including energy consumption and computing power. In this paper, we present a novel clock synchronization approach for WSNs, especially for low-resource networks. To minimize energy consumption and address the constraint of limited computing resources of nodes, we randomly select a subset of neighbors, in contrast to existing methods which consider all neighbors. Subsequently, each node selects half of the values from the chosen nodes to compute the clock average. Finally, the node adjusts its clock to the computed average. Experimental evaluation results show that the system achieves synchronization after 4 iterations and requires only one additional iteration when 10\% of nodes are malicious. The proposed technique reduces the influence of malicious nodes, storage space, computation time, and energy consumption, which is important for IoT applications.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication have connected devices, enabling major advances in various fields. The priority now is secure and efficient management of these interconnected systems. IoT ecosystems need access control to manage interactions. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC), and Context-Based Access Control (CBAC)&nbsp;are examined in the context of Industrial IoT (IIoT) in this paper. Intelligent manufacturing and anticipatory maintenance are among the many opportunities created by IoT and IIoT rapid growth. However, these advances present new security and access control challenges. Access control is essential for managing user, device, and application authorization in complex, interconnected environments. Our goal is to analyze their suitability, pros, and cons in industrial settings where strict access control is needed to ensure system safety, confidentiality, and efficiency. The IIoT case study implementation of these access control mechanisms is the focus of this paper. We examine an IIoT scenario in which a manufacturing plant has a network of machinery, sensors, and control systems. The case study shows how RBAC, ABAC, PBAC, and CBAC apply pragmatically. We evaluate their ability to manage access to critical machinery, data, and devices. We analyze and compare these access control mechanisms within the IIoT framework to determine the best one for the industrial environment, taking into account scalability, security, real-time decision making, and industrial process complexity. This paper examines access control mechanisms and practical observations from a real-world IIoT case study to improve IIoT security discussions. The findings can help IIoT practitioners, researchers, and decision-makers choose access control solutions. Industrial operations can become safer and more efficient.},

These sensors are characterized by their low memory capacity, constrained energy resources, and lack of early awareness regarding their specific placement within the distribution environment. In order to safeguard the integrity and confidentiality of data during transmission, it is imperative to uphold fundamental security measures. This duty elucidates many methodologies for safeguarding data transmission. The primary objective of this research endeavor is to ensure the security of the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Several studies and approaches have been proposed; nonetheless, the comprehensive understanding of time and safety remains largely unexplored. The current methodologies exhibit limitations in terms of temporal efficiency and the security of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In order to address the aforementioned concerns, this research study proposes the utilization of the Pareto Optimization Based Lion Swarm Optimization and Double Encryption based Blowfish method (PLSO-DEBF) method as a means to enhance overall system performance. The primary contributions of this study encompass the development of a comprehensive system model, the utilization of PLSO-DEBF for the selection of transmission nodes, and the incorporation of secure data transmission inside the system model.

abstract = {For the efficient monitoring and control of crop health, the timely and precise diagnosis of plant diseases is essential. Traditional techniques of disease diagnosis rely on visual examination by human experts, which can be laborious, arbitrary, and liable to mistakes. Machine learning approaches have recently shown promise as intelligent and automated solutions for analysing plant diseases. In this paper, we offer an intelligent system for the investigation and identification of plant diseases that makes use of machine learning methods. The method uses a large library of plant photos that includes both healthy and diseased plants in various states of health. Pre-processing is done on the dataset to extract pertinent properties including colour, texture, and shape. In order to effectively identify and categorise the ailments of the plant and support decision-making in real time, a system was developed that makes use of a camera sensor module. The SVM), CNN, with a linear nucleus, and the Support Vector Machine with a polysomic nucleus are three machine learning techniques that are highlighted in the paper. The recommended intelligent system performs a very accurate and efficient analysis of plant diseases. By accepting photos of plant samples taken using different technologies, such as cell-phones or drones, it offers real-time disease detection. By effectively identifying and managing plant diseases, the system can be used in agricultural settings, enabling farmers and agricultural specialists to reduce crop losses and maximise agricultural productivity.},

Agriculture practises must be improved to preserve a sustainable balance because agriculture’s importance and requirement are increasing along with the population. A vital part of the agricultural system is the soil. The accurate and thorough spatial soil information provided by soil composition detection can assist farmers in making decisions that will promote the growth of their crops. As a result, researchers concentrated on using AI and remote sensing to create models for the prediction of soil nutrient information that will aid farmers in exact fertilisation. A precise and economical solution for soil nutrient mapping is now available due to recent developments in sensor technology and machine learning-based soil analysis methods. Therefore, using machine learning (ML) techniques on remote sensing data can aid in developing a precision farming decision support system to increase crop output. For environmental modelling and risk assessment, complete and accurate geographic soil information is crucial.},

abstract = {This article explores the transformative impact of modern technology on avalanche response and safety, addressing the longstanding challenges associated with avalanches in mountainous regions. Historically, avalanches have presented significant dangers, compounded by the difficulties of conducting rescue operations in remote and harsh environments. However, recent technological advancements, including smartwatches with SOS features and specialized mobile applications, have ushered in a new era of avalanche safety. Smartwatches have emerged as crucial tools in avalanche safety. Equipped with SOS features and synchronized with mobile apps, these devices have revolutionized the way we approach avalanche emergencies. In this study, we propose a methodology that leverages smartwatch data and deep learning models to detect individuals buried under avalanche debris. This approach aims to significantly improve the chances of successful and timely rescue operations. The proposed methodology involves collecting data from smartwatches, which are equipped with various sensors to monitor location, movement, and environmental conditions. Deep learning models are then deployed to analyze this data, identifying patterns and anomalies associated with avalanche incidents. By harnessing these advanced technologies, our methodology offers the potential for real-time avalanche detection, thereby enhancing overall safety outcomes. One of the key strengths of this methodology is its adaptability to diverse avalanche scenarios. The study envisions a future where technology-driven avalanche safety becomes an integral component of outdoor activities, mitigating risks and enabling more effective response strategies in the face of this natural hazard.},

abstract = {Despite a long tradition of ‘non-expert’ participation in ecoacoustics research, asymmetrical distribution of resources and engagement between the Global North and Global South continue, extending to ecoacoustic sensing and design. Whilst there exists a growing body of work in Participatory Design (PD) addressing the technical and social challenges of ecoacoustic research, we find that popular PD methods inadequately address design justice and decolonising agendas. Through participatory ecoacoustic sensing and design engagements with a forest community in Ghana, we highlight the tensions that emerge when employing visual and written modes of PD in a context where an oral approach to creativity and communication is more appropriate. We present Justice-oriented Design Listening, an acoustically-mediated approach to PD, described through three modes: polyphony, pace and transformation. This work contributes to calls for design justice by developing a methodological approach that facilitates pluralistic participation in design when developing conservation technologies in non-Western contexts.},

abstract = {Awareness of internal sensations, or interoceptive awareness (IA) is a topic of interest spanning multiple disciplines. In psychology, several therapeutic frameworks which cultivate IA have emerged. Meanwhile, HCI designers have developed novel approaches to IA across diverse contexts and design goals. These HCI strategies may hold value for mental health, however, it’s unclear to what degree designerly IA techniques match or contrast with those used in therapeutic settings. We seek to address this gap in two parts. First, we offer a set of design opportunities based on IA practices used in HCI and findings from interviews with 22 counselors. Second, we share context-specific insights from a 5-week probe study involving 24 young women with nonclinical disordered eating behaviors, which are linked to interoceptive deficits. Together, the design opportunities and probe study findings provide guidance and highlight open questions regarding the design of technology-mediated IA support for mental health.},

abstract = {Online platforms provide support for many kinds of distress, including suicidal thoughts and behaviors. However, because many platforms restrict suicidal talk, volunteers on these platforms struggle with how to help suicidal people who come for support. We interviewed 11 volunteer counselors in a large online support platform, including after they role-played conversations with varying severities of suicidality, to explore practices and challenges when identifying and responding to suicidality. We then presented Speed Dating design concepts around emotional preparation and support, real-time guidance, training, and suicide detection. Participants wanted more support and preparation for conversations with suicidal people, but were conflicted about AI-based technologies, including trade-offs between potential benefits of conversational agents for training and limitations of prediction or real-time response suggestions, due to the sensitive, context-dependent decisions that volunteers must make. Our work has important implications for nuanced considerations and design choices around developing digital mental health technologies.},

abstract = {Proactive voice assistants (VAs) in smart homes predict users’ needs and autonomously take action by controlling smart devices and initiating voice-based features to support users’ various activities. Previous studies on proactive systems have primarily focused on determining action based on contextual information, such as user activities, physiological state, or mobile usage. However, there is a lack of research that considers user agency in VAs’ proactive actions, which empowers users to express their dynamic needs and preferences and promotes a sense of control. Thus, our study aims to explore verbal communication through which VAs can proactively take action while respecting user agency. To delve into communication between a proactive VA and a user, we used the Wizard of Oz method to set up a smart home environment, allowing controllable devices and unrestrained communication. This paper proposes design implications for the communication strategies of proactive VAs that respect user agency.},

abstract = {Extensive sitting is unhealthy; thus, countermeasures are needed to react to the ongoing trend toward more prolonged sitting. A variety of studies and guidelines have long addressed the question of how we can improve our sitting habits. Nevertheless, sitting time is still increasing. Here, smart devices can provide a general overview of sitting habits for more nuanced feedback on the user’s sitting posture. Based on a literature review (N=223), including publications from engineering, computer science, medical sciences, electronics, and more, our work guides developers of posture systems. There is a large variety of approaches, with pressure-sensing hardware and visual feedback being the most prominent. We found factors like environment, cost, privacy concerns, portability, and accuracy important for deciding hardware and feedback types. Further, one should consider the user’s capabilities, preferences, and tasks. Regarding user studies for sitting posture feedback, there is a need for better comparability and for investigating long-term effects.},

abstract = {Low-cost gas sensors (LCS) often produce inaccurate measurements due to varying environmental conditions that are not consistent with laboratory settings, leading to inadequate productivity levels compared to high-quality sensors. To address this issue, we propose the use of Machine Learning (ML) to predict accurate concentrations of pollutant gases acquired by LCS integrated into an embedded Internet of Things platform. However, a key challenge is to optimize an accurate ML design under low memory and computation power constraints of microcontrollers (MCUs) while maintaining accurate ML scores.After data analysis and pre-processing, we assess and analyze the performance of five ML algorithms to predict the concentration of pollutants gases from multiple specifications (weather, presence of other gases, etc.). To support the experiments, datasets from three sources are used: (1) VOCSens, (2) Belgian Interregional Environment Agency cell, and (3) Visual-Crossing. Once the best model was optimized and validated, multiple hard constraints were added to the selected ML structure to satisfy material and expert requirements. Trained models were ported to be implemented locally in a MCU after comparing several porting libraries. The assembled code obtained is evaluated based on two metrics: storage memory consumption and inference time, relative to the highest attainable capacities.The improved random forest is the best ML model for the used dataset with an R2 score meeting of 0.72 and Root Means Square Error of 0.0028 ppm. The best generated Tiny-ML model needs 3\% of RAM and 98\% of Flash storage.The empirical results prove that the developed ML algorithm applied to LCS provides high accuracy to predict pollutant gases. This algorithm can also be used to adjust the LCS systems to provide calibrated data in real time, even if the platform being used is not particularly advanced or powerful.},

This study collaboratively developed a Mixed Reality system with neurosurgeons to support self-training in microscopic suturing. Based on the neurosurgeons’ opinions, we implemented a level-appropriate microsurgical suture training system. For novices, the system offers shadow-matching training to support the practice of precise movements under the high-sensitivity environment of the microscope. For intermediates, it provides a real-time feedback system, which allows users to practice attention to details. Evaluation involved testing the novice system on students with no medical background and the intermediate system on neurosurgery residents. The effectiveness of the system was demonstrated through the experimental results and subsequent discussion.},

This opens the opportunity for active individual participation in data collection. To promote reflection on office well-being while overcoming experience sampling challenges in terms of privacy, notification, and display overload, and in-the-moment data collection, we developed Click-IO. Click-IO is a tangible, privacy-sensitive, mobile experience sampling tool that collects contextual information. We evaluated Click-IO for 20-days. The system enabled real-time reflections for office workers, promoting self-awareness of their environment and well-being. Its non-digital design ensured privacy-sensitive feedback collection, while its mobility facilitated in-the-moment feedback. Based on our findings, we identify design recommendations for the development of mobile experience sampling tools. Moreover, the integration of contextual data with environmental sensor data presented a more comprehensive understanding of individuals’ experiences. This research contributes to the development of experience sampling tools and sensor integration for understanding office well-being.},

However, interactive systems for supporting energy communities to coordinate around renewable energy resources are still lacking. We present SolarClub, a demand-shifting visualization system that supported households in coordinating their energy usage by booking energy-hungry activities when solar energy was available. We deployed SolarClub with four groups of neighbors (N=15) for a month. SolarClub successfully enabled neighbors to coordinate, even when some of those participating households were less flexible. While participants reported that SolarClub did not foster a feeling of community, it helped them empathize with their neighbors. Our findings demonstrate the potential of sensor- and visualization-based technology to help understand the relation between everyday practices and resources consumption, beyond individual eco-feedback. This work thus contributes to the development of a next generation of practices and technologies that support collective action for environmental sustainability.},

Despite an increased interest in studying developers’ concerns about XR device privacy, user perceptions have rarely been addressed. We surveyed 464 XR users to assess their awareness, concerns, and coping strategies around XR data in 18 scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that many factors, such as data types and sensitivity, affect users’ perceptions of privacy in XR. However, users’ limited awareness of XR sensors’ granular data collection capabilities, such as involuntary body signals of emotional responses, restricted the range of privacy-protective strategies they used. Our results highlight a need to enhance users’ awareness of data privacy threats in XR, design privacy-choice interfaces tailored to XR environments, and develop transparent XR data practices.},

abstract = {Simultaneous declines in visual function (e.g., dynamic visual acuity), cognitive ability (e.g., cognitive control/multitasking), and physical function (e.g., balance) are major symptoms of aging. Integrating stimulation for those sensory channels into a game could be a suitable way for older adults to engage in long-term health interventions. However, existing game design has not considered the relationship and synergistic impact of multisensory channels of dynamic visual acuity, cognitive ability, and physical function for older adults. We therefore developed the first multisensory VR game system prototype based on cognitive psychology paradigms (e.g., multitasking and Go/No-Go tasks), full-body movement (limb movement), and dynamic visual acuity exercises (horizontal, vertical and forward-backward eye movements) in the VR system environment. We then conducted an experiment to measure the acceptability (in terms of e.g., cybersickness, mental workload, etc.) of our VR game for older adults. The young adults and a PC task were included for comparisons. Qualitative and quantitative results showed that older adults did not experience cybersickness in either sitting or standing postures during the VR gameplay; they well-accepted the workload of the VR game compared to the PC task. Our findings revealed that the design combination of three sensory channels shows synergistic benefits for older adults. Our game encourages older adults to engage in extensive body movement in sitting and standing postures, this is particularly important to people with disabilities who cannot stand. Design implications are provided for the future development and implementation of VR game design for older adults. Our work provides empirical support for the acceptability of multisensory VR systems in older adults, and contributes to the future design of VR games for older adults.},

Unlike traditional methods, PepperPose actively tracks the user and refines its viewpoint, facilitating enhanced pose accuracy across different locations and actions. This allows users to enjoy a seamless action-sensing experience. Our evaluation, involving 30 participants undertaking daily functioning and exercise actions in a home-like space, underscores the robot’s promising capabilities.

Yet, existing design tools for mid-air haptics primarily support creating tactile sensations (i.e., tactons) which cannot change at runtime. These tactons lack expressiveness in interactive scenarios where a continuous closed-loop response to user movement or environmental states is desirable. This paper introduces AdapTics, a toolkit featuring a graphical interface for rapid prototyping of adaptive tactons—dynamic sensations that can adjust at runtime based on user interactions, environmental changes, or other inputs. A software library and a Unity package accompany the graphical interface to enable integration of adaptive tactons in existing applications. We present the design space offered by AdapTics for creating adaptive mid-air ultrasound tactons and show the design tool can improve Creativity Support Index ratings for Exploration and Expressiveness in a user study with 12 XR and haptic designers.},

We contribute the synthesis of functional reusable inks, that can be formulated using simple household materials. Electrical characterization of inks indicates that they outperform commercially available carbon inks. Cyclic voltammetry experiments show that our inks are electrochemically active and detect glucose and cortisol at activation voltages of -0.36 V and -0.22 V, respectively. Chronoamperometry experiments show that the sensors can detect the full range of glucose and cortisol levels typically found in sweat. Results from a user evaluation show that ecSkin sensors successfully function on the skin. Finally, we demonstrate three applications to illustrate how ecSkin devices can be deployed for various interactive applications.},

abstract = {The growing popularity of contact-free smart sensing has contributed to the development of the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). The contact-free sensory data has great potential to mine and analyze the hidden information for AIoT-enabled applications. However, due to the limited storage resource of contact-free smart sensing devices, data is naturally stored in the cloud, which is at risk of privacy leakage. Cloud storage is generally considered insecure. On one hand, the openness of the cloud environment makes the data easy to be attacked, and the complex AIoT environment also makes the data transmission process vulnerable to the third party. On the other hand, the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) is untrusted. In this article, to ensure the security of data from contact-free smart sensing devices, a Cloud-Edge-End cooperative storage scheme is proposed, which takes full advantage of the differences in the cloud, edge, and end. Firstly, the processed sensory data is stored separately in the three layers by utilizing well-designed data partitioning strategy. This scheme can increase the difficulty of privacy leakage in the transmission process and avoid internal and external attacks. Besides, the contact-free sensory data is highly time-dependent. Therefore, combined with the Cloud-Edge-End cooperation model, this article proposes a delta-based data update method and extends it into a hybrid update mode to improve the synchronization efficiency. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed cooperative storage method can resist various security threats in bad situations and outperform other update methods in synchronization efficiency, significantly reducing the synchronization overhead in AIoT.},

Given the sensitivity of HIV-related information and the risks associated with unintended HIV status disclosure, clients’ privacy perceptions towards eHealth applications should be examined to develop client-centered technologies. Through focus group discussions with antiretroviral therapy (ART) clients from Lighthouse Trust, Malawi’s public HIV care program, we explored perceptions of data security and privacy, including their understanding of data flow and their concerns about data confidentiality across several layers of data use. Our findings highlight the broad privacy concerns that affect ART clients’ day-to-day choices, clients’ trust in Malawi’s health system, and their acceptance of, and familiarity with, point-of-care technologies used in HIV care. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for building robust digital health systems in low- and middle-income countries with limited resources, nascent privacy regulations, and political will to take action to protect client data.},

abstract = {Mobile apps which support women’s health have developed rapidly alongside the increasing de-stigmatisation of female reproductive wellbeing. However, the ubiquity of these apps has advanced the practice of intimate surveillance and the commodification of sensitive user data. While the overturning of Roe v. Wade has prompted reflection on the privacy and safety implications of female mobile health (mHealth) apps, the privacy practices of these apps have yet to be thoroughly examined in a post-Roe world. We investigated the privacy practices of&nbsp;20 popular female mHealth apps, combining a thematic analysis of Data safety sections and privacy policies with a privacy-focused usability inspection. Our findings revealed problematic practices, including inconsistencies across privacy policy content and privacy-related app features, flawed consent and data deletion mechanisms, and covert gathering of sensitive data. We present recommendations for improving privacy practices, and call for a dedicated focus not only on user privacy, but also safety.},

Whilst Mobile Health (mHealth) technologies have the potential to improve antenatal care experiences and health outcomes, research on women from ethnically marginalised backgrounds in developed countries remains limited. We report on a series of Co-creation Workshops with 11 Roma women who have settled in the North of England. In this paper, we present thematic insights about their experiences and needs during pregnancy, and their perceptions and attitudes towards digital technologies to inform the design of culturally sensitive mHealth. We contribute to Human Computer Interaction (HCI) with new empirical research to discourses on Critical Digital Health, Intersectional HCI and Women-centred Design, highlight implications for design and encourage a more critical and intersectional design approach to accommodate better the experiences of ethnically marginalised groups whose needs arguably tend to be overlooked and stereotyped.},

abstract = {The paradigm of bare-hand interaction has become increasingly prevalent in Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) environments, propelled by advancements in hand tracking technology. However, a significant challenge arises in delivering haptic feedback to users’ hands, due to the necessity for the hands to remain bare. In response to this challenge, recent research has proposed an indirect solution of providing haptic feedback to the forearm. In this work, we present QuadStretcher, a skin stretch display featuring four independently controlled stretching units surrounding the forearm. While achieving rich haptic expression, our device also eliminates the need for a grounding base on the forearm by using a pair of counteracting tactors, thereby reducing bulkiness. To assess the effectiveness of QuadStretcher in facilitating immersive bare-hand experiences, we conducted a comparative user evaluation (n = 20) with a baseline solution, Squeezer. The results confirmed that QuadStretcher outperformed Squeezer in terms of expressing force direction and heightening the sense of realism, particularly in 3-DoF VR interactions such as pulling a rubber band, hooking a fishing rod, and swinging a tennis racket. We further discuss the design insights gained from qualitative user interviews, presenting key takeaways for future forearm-haptic systems aimed at advancing AR/VR bare-hand experiences.},

Gestures must meet users’ needs and constraints in diverse scenarios to gain widespread acceptance. Although mid-air gestures have been proposed in various user contexts, it is still unclear to what extent users want to integrate them into different scenarios in their smart homes, along with the motivations driving this desire. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether users will remain consistent in their suggestions when transitioning to alternative scenarios within a smart home. This study contributes methodologically by adapting a bottom-up frame-based design process. We offer insights into preferred devices and commands in different smart home scenarios. Using our results, we can assist in designing gestures in the smart home that are consistent with individual needs across devices and scenarios, while maximizing the reuse and transferability of gestural knowledge.},

However, the existing approaches have some limitations, for example, wearable devices can hinder users’ fitness activities; computer vision–based solutions pose the risk of privacy breach, and so on. Fortunately, we observed that smartspeaker, acoustic-based sensing is a promising method of activity monitoring. In this article, we propose Afitness, an acoustic-based sensing system that enables non-intrusive, passive, and high-precision fitness detection. Afitness has the following three innovations. (i) We utilize pulse compression to generate high-precision motion distance images on commercial devices that can be visually recognized. (ii) We propose a data augmentation algorithm, which also incorporates transfer learning to greatly reduce the pressure of data collection. (iii) We exploit incremental learning techniques that allow Afitness to improve the portability of our system and recognize new actions. Overall, Afitness achieves acoustic signal interpretability and environmental reliability detection.},

abstract = {Gait is regarded as a unique feature for identifying people, and gait recognition is the basis of various customized services of the IoT. Unlike traditional techniques for identifying people, the Wi-Fi-based technique is unconstrained by illumination conditions and such that it eliminates the need for dense, specialized sensors and wearable devices. Although deep learning-based sensing models are conducive to the development of Wi-Fi-based identification, the latter technique relies on a large amount of data and requires a long training time, where this limits the scope of its use for identifying people. In this study, we propose a Wi-Fi sensing model called Wave-CapNet for human identification. We use data processing to eliminate errors in the raw data so that the model can extract the characteristics in channel state information (CSI). We also design a dedicated adaptive wavelet neural network to extract representative features from Wi-Fi signals with only a few epochs of training and a small number of parameters. Experiments show that it can identify human gait with an average accuracy of 99\%. Moreover, it can achieve an average accuracy of 95\% by using only 10\% of the data and fewer than five epochs and outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.},

While the visual detachment from the real world enables unique immersive experiences, users risk collisions due to their inability to perceive physical obstacles in their environment. Even the mere anticipation of a collision can adversely affect the overall experience and erode user confidence in the VR system. However, there are currently no valid tools for assessing collision anxiety. We present the iterative development and validation of the Collision Anxiety Questionnaire (CAQ), involving an exploratory and a confirmatory factor analysis with a total of 159 participants. The results provide evidence for both discriminant and convergent validity and a good model fit for the final CAQ with three subscales: general collision anxiety, orientation, and interpersonal collision anxiety. By utilizing the CAQ, researchers can examine potential confounding effects of collision anxiety and evaluate methods for its mitigation.},

abstract = {Human activity recognition&nbsp;(HAR) and, more broadly, activities of daily life recognition using wearable devices have the potential to transform a number of applications, including mobile healthcare, smart homes, and fitness monitoring. Recent approaches for HAR use multiple sensors on various locations on the body to achieve higher accuracy for complex activities. While multiple sensors increase the accuracy, they are also susceptible to reliability issues when one or more sensors are unable to provide data to the application due to sensor malfunction, user error, or energy limitations. Training multiple activity classifiers that use a subset of sensors is not desirable, since it may lead to reduced accuracy for applications. To handle these limitations, we propose a novel generative approach that recovers the missing data of sensors using data available from other sensors. The recovered data are then used to seamlessly classify activities. Experiments using three publicly available activity datasets show that with data missing from one sensor, the proposed approach achieves accuracy that is within 10\% of the accuracy with no missing data. Moreover, implementation on a wearable device prototype shows that the proposed approach takes about 1.5&nbsp;ms for recovering data in the w-HAR dataset, which results in an energy consumption of 606&nbsp;μJ. The low-energy consumption ensures that SensorGAN is suitable for effectively recovering data in tinyML applications on energy-constrained devices.},

abstract = {Feeling haptics with our fingerpads is how we achieve manual tasks (e.g., operate a needle or press buttons). Following this, research started adding actuators atop the users’ fingerpads to render haptic feedback for interactive virtual environments. Recently, many have moved away from thick actuators (e.g., vibration motors) and turned to electrode-films with electrotactile stimulation—allowing users to still feel some sensations through the devices when touching physical objects (e.g., compliance or some macro features). However, we argue \&amp; demonstrate that thin devices are not enough to maximize the user's dexterity. We evaluate how adding small holes to electrotactile films can allow direct contact and thus increase haptic permeability, resulting in: (1) improved perception of tactile features; and (2) improved force control in grasping tasks. Finally, we observed participants in interactive experiences and found that holes can preserve dexterity with physical tasks while still benefiting from haptic feedback.},

We provide three contributions: (1) We demonstrate the feasibility of the concept through a psychophysics study, showing that virtual compliance can be continuously modulated, and perceived softness can be increased by approximately 30 Shore A levels. (2) A qualitative study indicates the desirability of such a device, showing that a back-of-the-finger haptic device has many attractive qualities. (3) To implement vARitouch, we identify a novel way to measure pressure from the back of the finger by repurposing a pulse oximetry sensor.

However, current cold presentations such as Peltier devices face challenges like low energy efficiency and the need for complicated equipment. To address these, we suggest leveraging alcohol’s endothermic property during evaporation. Our prototype, a wristwatch wearable with a fan, capitalizes on alcohol’s high volatility by absorbing ambient heat upon evaporation. The device further enhances the cooling effect by circulating air around the skin. This approach simplifies the setup required for cooling technologies and is more energy-efficient than Peltier-based systems. We also integrated perfume, which is a mixture of alcohol and scent substance, and presented a unique cooling and scent experience. The use of alcohol as a cooling method was not considered conventional, but social changes after COVID-19 made it easy to obtain a tiny amount of alcohol.},

Existing HAR methods, though yielding promising performance in indoor scenarios, highly depend on a massive labeled dataset for training which is extremely difficult to acquire in practical applications. In this paper, we present an automatic data labeling and HAR system, termed AutoDLAR. Taking a semi-supervised cross-modal learning framework with a hybrid loss function as the core, AutoDLAR transfers rich visual information to automatically label WiFi signals for WiFi-based HAR. Specifically, we devise a lightweight and multi-view WiFi sensing model with a parallel feature embedding method to accurately identify activities and accelerate recognition speed. Then, we exploit the video data to fine-tune a well-established visual HAR model, generating effective pseudo-labels for guiding the WiFi model’s training. We also build a synchronized Video-WiFi dataset with seven types of human activities under different scenarios to enable training and validating the semi-supervised HAR system. Extensive experiments on our collected activity dataset and the emotion recognition benchmark demonstrate that AutoDLAR attains an average accuracy of over 95.89\% without manual labeling and only spends the inference time of 3.35&nbsp;ms, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.},

abstract = {Social robotics has recently focused on developing AI agents that recognise and respond to human emotions. The use of plan-based approaches is promising, especially in domains where collecting data in advance is challenging (e.g., medical domains). We have designed and developed a system that implements a social robot to help children cope with painful and distressing medical procedures in a clinical setting. Our approach uses automated planning as a core component for action selection in order to generate plans that include physical, sensory, and social actions for the robot to use when interacting with humans. A key capability of our system is that the robot’s behaviour adapts based on the affective state of the child patient. The robot must operate in a challenging physical and social environment where appropriate and safe interaction with children, parents/caregivers, and healthcare professionals is crucial. In this paper, we present our system, examine some of the key challenges of the scenario, and describe how they are addressed by our system. We provide an overview of some of the lab-based trials that we have conducted. The system is currently undergoing usability studies at two hospitals, with the intention of moving onto clinical trials.},

abstract = {This paper aims to solve the challenge of quantifying the perfor- mance of Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) computer systems used for data re-injection. The system can be represented as a multiple queue and server system that operates on a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) basis. The task at hand involves establishing tight bounds on end-to-end delay and system backlog. This is necessary to optimise buffer and pre-buffer time configurations. Network Calculus (NC) is chosen as the basic analytical framework to achieve this. In the literature, there are different techniques for estimating arrival and service curves from measurement data which can be used for NC calcu- lations. We have selected four of these methods to be applied to datasets of industrial Timestamp Logging (TL). The problem arises because these conventional methods often produce bounds that are much larger (by a factor of 1000 or more) than the measured maximum values, resulting in inefficient design of HIL system pa- rameters and inefficient resource usage. The proposed approach, called TBASCEM, introduces a reverse engineering approach based on linear NC equations for estimating the parameters of arrival and service curves. By imposing constraints on the equation variables and employing non-linear optimization, TBASCEM searches for a burst parameter estimation which derives tight global delay bounds. In addition, TBASCEM simplifies the run-time measurement pro- cess, supporting real-time data acquisition to evaluate and optimise HIL system performance, and enhancing observability to adapt the HIL configuration to new sensor data. The benefits of TBASCEM are clearly that it enables an efficient performance logging of arrival and service curve parameters and with deriving tighter bounds in HIL systems, compared to evaluated state-of-the-art methods, mak- ing TBASCEM an invaluable tool for optimising and monitoring streaming applications in non-hard-real-time environments.},

abstract = {Aiming at the problems that the existing computer room environment monitoring system has a low communication efficiency and can't access to Ethernet, a new system that can monitor environmental parameters in real time and has the ability to remotely control the equipment is designed. The system mainly consists of a controller and multiple monitors. The controller and the monitor both use STM32 chips based on the ARM core. The monitors are loaded with various sensors to collect environmental parameters. The controller obtains the data of the monitor and responds to the abnormal situation, alarms and automatically opens the safety equipment in the computer room, so that environmental parameters are restored to normal. The controller is connected to the W5500 chip through the SPI interface. The W5500 driver is combined with FreeModbus protocol stack in the software to complete the Modbus TCP protocol communication function between the controller and the host computer. After testing, the intelligent computer room environment monitoring system can monitor the environmental parameters of the computer room in real time. And it can communicate with the host computer via Ethernet to complete the functions of data storage, viewing and controlling the device to meet the expected requirements.},

abstract = {The detection and morphology characterization of these biological samples are the basis of life research. Optical microscopic imaging has great advantages in the characterization and detection of biological samples because of its characteristics of low sample requirements, good environmental adaptability, convenient, fast and non-destructive detection. However, due to the influence of optical diffraction limit, the resolution of optical microscopic imaging method is comparative low and thus limits the applications. Due to the polarization characteristics of the scattering field from scatterer are closely related to the microstructure of the scatterer, the measurement of the polarization characteristics of the scattering field can improve the detection and characterization ability of biological samples. Meanwhile, to achieve a higher resolution and to obtain a larger range of particle near-field scattering spectral distribution, the method in the paper takes the image acquisition part of the traditional machine vision system as the main body and a polarization modulation module is added to build an image acquisition device. The non-intuitive images obtained in the experiment are compared with the traditional direct imaging, and the results prove that the non-intuitive polarization parameter imaging can obtain the particle near-field scattering spectral distribution in a larger range than the traditional direct imaging. It is proved that non-intuitive light wave vectors are more sensitive to near-field scattering and have higher resolution.},
