abstract = {Mobile malware are increasing their complexity to be able to evade the current detection mechanism by gathering our sensitive and private information. For this reason, an active research field is represented by malware detection, with a great effort in the development of deep learning models starting from a set of malicious and legitimate applications. The recent introduction of quantum computing made possible quantum machine learning i.e., the integration of quantum algorithms within machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose a comparison between several deep learning models, by taking into account also a hybrid quantum malware detector. We explore the effectiveness of different architectures for malicious family detection in the Android environment: LeNet, AlexNet, a Convolutional Neural Network model designed by authors, VGG16 and a Hybrid Quantum Convolutional Neural Network i.e., a model where the first layer is a quantum convolution that uses transformations in circuits to simulate the behavior of a quantum computer. Experiments performed on a real-world dataset composed of 8446 Android malicious and legitimate applications allow us to compare the various models, with particular regard to the quantum model concerning the other ones.},

abstract = {Recently wearable EEG monitoring devices with seizure detection processor using convolutional neural network (CNN) have been proposed to detect the seizure onset of patients in real time for alert or stimulation purpose. High energy efficiency and accuracy are required for the seizure detection processor due to the tight energy constraint of wearable devices. However, the use of CNN and multi-channel processing nature of seizure detection result in significant energy consumption. In this work, an energy-efficient seizure detection processor is proposed, featuring multi-stage CNN classification, segmented data processing and adaptive channel selection to reduce the energy consumption while achieving high accuracy. The design has been fabricated and tested using a 55nm process technology. Compared with several state-of-the-art designs, the proposed design achieves the lowest energy per classification (0.32 μJ) with high sensitivity (97.78\%) and low false positive rate per hour (0.5).},

abstract = {Since its inception, underwater digital acoustic communication has required custom hardware that neither has the economies of scale nor is pervasive. We present the first acoustic system that brings underwater messaging capabilities to existing mobile devices like smartphones and smart watches. Our software-only solution leverages audio sensors, i.e., microphones and speakers, ubiquitous in today's devices to enable acoustic underwater communication between mobile devices. To achieve this, we design a communication system that in real-time adapts to differences in frequency responses across mobile devices, changes in multipath and noise levels at different locations and dynamic channel changes due to mobility. We evaluate our system in six different real-world underwater environments with depths of 2--15 m in the presence of boats, ships and people fishing and kayaking. Our results show that our system can in real-time adapt its frequency band and achieve bit rates of 100 bps to 1.8 kbps and a range of 30 m. By using a lower bit rate of 10--20 bps, we can further increase the range to 100 m. As smartphones and watches are increasingly being used in underwater scenarios, our software-based approach has the potential to make underwater messaging capabilities widely available to anyone with a mobile device.Project page with open-source code and data can be found here: https://underwatermessaging.cs.washington.edu/},

abstract = {Although Deep Learning (DL) is revolutionising practices across fields, it requires a large amount of data and computing resources, requires considerable training time, and is thus expensive. This study proposes a transfer learning approach by adopting a simplified version of a standard Convolution Neural Network (CNN), which is successful in another domain. We explored three transfer learning approaches: freezing all layers except the first and the last layer of the CNN model, which we had modified, freezing the first layer, updating the weights of the rest of the layers, and fine-tuning the entire network. Furthermore, we trained a DL model from scratch to act as a baseline. We performed the experiments on the Edge Impulse platform. We evaluated the models based on plant-village, tea diseases and land use datasets. Fine-tuning and training the whole network produced the best precision, accuracy, recall, f-measure and sensitivity across the datasets. All three transfer learning schemes significantly reduced the training by more than half. Further, we deployed the fine-tuned model in detecting diseases in tea two months after the idea's conception, and it showed a good correlation with the experts' decisions. The evaluation results showed that it is viable to perform transfer learning among domains to accelerate solutions deployments. Additionally, Edge Impulse is ideal in resource-constrained environments, especially in developing countries lacking computing resources and expertise to train DL models from scratch. This insight can propel the development and rollout of various applications addressing the Sustainable Development Goals targeted at zero hunger and no poverty, among other goals.},

abstract = {IoT devices are becoming increasingly complex, support multiple sensors and often rely on batteries and renewable energy. Scheduling algorithms can help to manage their energy usage. When multiple devices cooperatively monitor an environment, scheduling sensing tasks across a distributed set of IoT devices can be challenging because they have limited information about other devices, limited energy and communication bandwidth. In addition, sharing information between devices can be costly in terms of energy.Our Tier-based Task scheduling protocol (T2), is an energy efficient distributed scheduler for a network of multi-sensor IoT devices. T2, adapting on an epoch-by-epoch basis distributes task executions throughout an epoch to minimize temporal sensing overlap without exceeding task deadlines. Our experiments show that T2 schedules an IoT device's sensing task start time before its deadline expires. When compared against a simple periodic scheduler, T2 schedules closer to the optimal centralized EDF scheduler.},

abstract = {Backscatter communication enables miniature, batteryless, and low-cost wireless sensors. Since electromagnetic waves are strongly attenuated in several scenarios, backscatter communication in metals via acoustic waves can leverage various applications, e. g., in structural health monitoring. When backscattering, the Tag has little control over the modulation it performs on the carrier wave. Therefore, existing approaches commonly employ differential binary modulation schemes, limiting the achievable data rates. To overcome this limitation, we derive a channel model that accurately describes the modulation in an acoustic backscatter channel---as, e. g., found in steel beams---and leverage it to achieve higher-order load modulation. We present an open-source Reader and Tag pair prototype based on COTS components that we have developed for communication and on-the-fly channel characterization. We explore the influence of various parameters on communication performance on different channels. Moreover, (i) we are the first to demonstrate that acoustic backscatter is feasible in guided-wave channels, covering up to 3 meters, and that (ii) our modulation scheme achieves up to 211\% higher data rates than binary modulation schemes, and (iii) provides reliable communication through channel coding.},

abstract = {In modern complex physical systems, advanced sensing technologies extend the sensor coverage but also increase the difficulties of improving system monitoring capabilities based on real-time data availability. Traditional model-based methods of sensor management are limited to specific systems/settings, which can be challenged when system knowledge is intractable. Fortunately, the large amount of data collected in real-time allows machine learning methods to be a complement. Especially, reinforcement learning-based control is recognized for its capability to dynamically interact with systems. However, the direct implementation of learning methods easily overfits and results in inaccurate physics modeling for sensor management. Although physical regularization is a popular direction to bridge the gap, learning-based sensor control still suffers from convergence failure under highly complex and uncertain scenarios. This paper develops physics-embedded and self-supervised reinforcement learning for sensor management using an intrinsic reward. Specifically, the intrinsic-motivated sensor management (IMSM) constructs the local surprise information from the physical latent features, which captures hidden states in observations, and thus intrinsically motivates the agent to speed-up exploration. We show that the designs can not only relieve the lack of consistency with underlying physics/physical dynamics, but also adapt the global objective of maximizing monitoring capabilities to local environment changes. We demonstrate its effectiveness by experiments on physical system sensor control. The proposed model is implemented for the sensor management of unmanned vehicles and sensor rescheduling in complex/settled power systems, with or without observability constraints. Numerical results show that our model provides consistently higher threat detection accuracy and better observability recovery, as compared to existing methods.},

However, existing studies on recommender systems have primarily focused on e-commerce platforms and other online services. They did not consider the unique features of indoor shopping in real stores such as the physical environments and objects, which significantly affect the movement and purchase behaviors of customers, thereby representing the "spatiotemporal contexts" that are critical to identifying recommendable items. In this study, we propose a gamification approach wherein a real store is emulated in a pixel world and a recurrent convolutional network is trained to learn the spatiotemporal representation of offline shopping. The superiority and advantages of our method over existing sequential recommender systems are demonstrated through a real-world application in a hypermarket. We believe that our work can significantly contribute to promoting the practice of providing recommendations in offline stores and services.},

abstract = {This paper contains the research proposal of Mary Pidgeon that was presented at the MMSys 2022 doctoral symposium. Emotion recognition from physiological signals has seen a huge growth in recent decades. Wearables such as smart watches now have sensors to accurately measure physiological signals such as electrocardiography (ECG), blood volume pressure (BVP), galvanic skin response (GSR), and skin temperature (ST). These sensors have also been embedded in textiles. Collaborative body sensor networks (CBSN) have been used to analyse emotion reactions in a social setting from heart rate sensors. Federated learning, a recently proposed machine learning paradigm, protects user's private information while using information from several users to train a global machine learning model. Federated learning has several categorisations based on data partitioning, the privacy mechanisms, machine learning models and methods for solving heterogeneity. In this doctoral thesis, we propose using a smart clothing body sensor network to collect peripheral physiological data while protecting the user's privacy using federated machine learning. We present three primary research questions to address the challenges in emotion prediction, data collection from e-textile sensors and federated (FL) learning.},

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has attracted tremendous attentions in recent years due to its privacy-preserving measures and great potential in some distributed but privacy-sensitive applications, such as finance and health. However, high communication overloads for transmitting high-dimensional networks and extra security masks remain a bottleneck of FL. This article proposes a communication-efficient FL framework with an Adaptive Quantized Gradient (AQG), which adaptively adjusts the quantization level based on a local gradient’s update to fully utilize the heterogeneity of local data distribution for reducing unnecessary transmissions. In addition, client dropout issues are taken into account and an Augmented AQG is developed, which could limit the dropout noise with an appropriate amplification mechanism for transmitted gradients. Theoretical analysis and experiment results show that the proposed AQG leads to 18\% to 50\% of additional transmission reduction as compared with existing popular methods, including Quantized Gradient Descent (QGD) and Lazily Aggregated Quantized (LAQ) gradient-based methods without deteriorating convergence properties. Experiments with heterogenous data distributions corroborate a more significant transmission reduction compared with independent identical data distributions. The proposed AQG is robust to a client dropping rate up to 90\% empirically, and the Augmented AQG manages to further improve the FL system’s communication efficiency with the presence of moderate-scale client dropouts commonly seen in practical FL scenarios.},

abstract = {Researchers and journalists have repeatedly shown that algorithms commonly used in domains such as credit, employment, healthcare, or criminal justice can have discriminatory effects. Some organizations have tried to mitigate these effects by simply removing sensitive features from an algorithm's inputs. In this paper, we explore the limits of this approach using a unique opportunity. In 2019, Facebook agreed to settle a lawsuit by removing certain sensitive features from inputs of an algorithm that identifies users similar to those provided by an advertiser for ad targeting, making both the modified and unmodified versions of the algorithm available to advertisers. We develop methodologies to measure biases along the lines of gender, age, and race in the audiences created by this modified algorithm, relative to the unmodified one. Our results provide experimental proof that merely removing demographic features from a real-world algorithmic system's inputs can fail to prevent biased outputs. As a result, organizations using algorithms to help mediate access to important life opportunities should consider other approaches to mitigating discriminatory effects.},

abstract = {Virtual and Augmented Reality is one of the key driving technologies of the 4th Industrial Revolution, which is expected to radically disrupt almost every business sector and transform the way we live and interact with our environment and each other. End-user devices will soon enable users to immerse in 3D Virtual Environments (VEs) that offer access to remote services, such as health care, training and education, entertainment and social interaction. The advent of fast highly-available network connectivity in combination with afford- able 3D hardware (GPUs, VR/AR HMDs, etc.) has enabled making Networked Virtual Environments (NVEs) possible and available to multiple simultaneous end-users beyond the confines of expensive purpose-built 3D facilities and laboratories.However, the algorithms making possible the NVEs of today are already reaching their limits, proving unreliable, suffer asynchronies and deployed over an inherently fault-prone network infrastructure. Current developments of distributed architectures used in NVEs handle concurrency by either providing weak consistency guarantees (e.g., eventual consistency), or by relying on the bounded life span of inconsistent states. Although sufficient for non-critical, yet time sensitive applications, those solutions will be incapable of handling the next generation of interactive Virtual Environments, where precise consistency guarantees will be required. Thus, new scalable, robust, and responsive strategies that can support the needs of the NVEs of tomorrow are necessary.Recent scientific works are shifting the viewpoint around the practicality of strongly consistent distributed storage spaces by proposing latency-efficient algorithms of atomic R/W Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) with provable consistency guarantees. In this work we focus on transforming the theoretical findings of DSMs into tangible implementations and in investigating the practicality of those algorithmic solutions in Virtual Environments.},

abstract = {Nowadays, many people suffer from depression, anxiety disorder, stress and bad emotions. Most of the times, the causes are a chaotic lifestyle, stressful jobs and activities, wrong habits and a permanent sense of uncertainty. Therefore, well-being plays an increasingly important role in people’s lives, as it can help them to prevent chronic disease and long-term illnesses. However, well-being does not concern only healthy lifestyle, rather it is necessary to consider also mental health and interior happiness. In this position paper, we propose the idea of FlowMe, a cross-domain context-aware recommender system of optimal experiences, i.e. situations when people report feelings of deep enjoyment, forgetting the passage of time and external worries, and reaching an inner harmony on which their general happiness depends. In our perspective, FlowMe could be connected to different IoT devices and applications, such as social media, to collect data from the users and learn their mood, behaviour and habits, in order to suggest personalized optimal experiences when they are feeling a negative emotion. Also, the system will recognise when the user is in the flow doing a certain activity. FlowMe takes into account optimal experiences from various domains, considering users’ preferences and their context.},

abstract = {Metastable materials, which exhibit excellent physical properties that do not exist in the thermodynamic steady state, have recently garnered significant attention. Metastable materials are typically obtained via containerless microgravity experiments. The National Space Science Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences combines an electrostatic levitation device and a drop tube to achieve electrostatic levitation such that a containerless environment can be created, where the free fall of objects in the drop tube can overcome the effect of gravity. Molten droplets, i.e., a metastable material, with a diameter of approximately 2 mm are obtained in such an environment. An effective approach for investigating the volume, density, and other thermal physical parameters of molten droplets is to detect and extract edge information from images acquired using high-speed cameras. To adapt to the real-time nature of edge detection, we build a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) experimental platform and improve the traditional Canny algorithm to implement edge detection for molten droplets. The Canny edge detection algorithm primarily comprises a Gaussian filtering module, gradient magnitude and direction computation module, non-maximum suppression module, and hysteresis thresholding module. However, the traditional Canny algorithm is extremely sensitive to noise in the edge detection of molten droplet images; therefore, it typically detects false edges and overlooks true edges. Hence, we replace traditional 2 \texttimes{} 2 templates with 3 \texttimes{} 3 Sobel operator templates in the gradient magnitude computation module, as well as use four-direction templates instead of two-direction templates. In the traditional Canny algorithm, thresholds cannot be adaptively selected but must be manually set. To address the threshold adaptation issue, we add a threshold selection module, in which the maximum between-class variance method is used to adaptively select the thresholds. The experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately extract the edges of molten droplet images and provide clear edge details. Additionally, the proposed algorithm affords good adaptiveness, as well as high flexibility and operating speed on the FPGA.},

abstract = {Providing machine learning services is becoming profit business for IT companies. It is estimated that the AI-related business will bring trillions of dollars to the global economy. When selling machine learning services, companies should consider two important aspects: the security of the DNN model and the inference latency. The DNN models are expensive to train and represent precious intellectual property. The inference latency is important because modern DNN models are usually deployed to time-sensitive tasks and the inference latency affects the user's experience. Existing solutions cannot achieve a good balance between these two factors. To solve this problem, we propose TEESlice that provides a strong security guarantee and low service latency at the same time. TEESlice utilizes two kinds of specialized hardware: Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and existing AI accelerators. When the company wants to deploy a private DNN model on the user's device, TEESlice can be used to extract the private information into model slices. The slices are attached to a public privacy-excluded backbone to form a hybrid model that has similar performance to the original model. When deploying the hybrid model, the lightweight privacy-related slice is secured by the TEE and the public backbone is put on the AI accelerators. The TEE provides a strong security guarantee on the model privacy and the accelerators reduce the computation latency of the heavy model backbone. Experimental results show that TEESlice can achieve more than 10x throughput promotion with the same level of strong security guarantee as putting the whole model inside the TEE. If the model provider wants to further verify the correctness of the accelerator's computation, TEESlice can still achieve 3-4x performance improvement.},

abstract = {Studying the temporal and spatial changes of Xinjiang's agricultural drought vulnerability is conducive to enabling us to grasp the evolution track of Xinjiang's the agricultural insurance development level and provides a theoretical basis for the harmonious and healthy development of Xinjiang's the agricultural insurance. Due to Xinjiang's arid climate and fragile ecological environment. It is of great research significance to explore the effective ways of the agricultural insurance development to achieve agricultural economic stability. This study uses the meteorological data of 14 prefectures(cities)in Xinjiang from 2004 to 2018, uses the improved entropy method to calculate the agricultural drought vulnerability and its composition of Xinjiang, and focuses on the impact of agricultural drought vulnerability on the development of the agricultural insurance under the background of meteorological disasters through the dynamic panel measurement model. The researches show that:(1). Xinjiang has a high degree of agricultural drought vulnerability, but the development level of the agricultural insurance is not high. Their inter-annual changes are unstable and regional differences are obvious;(2).The exposure, sensitivity and resilience of agricultural drought vulnerability negatively affect the development level of the agricultural insurance, which is unfavorable to the development of the agricultural insurance;(3).Rural human capital and government intervention have a significant positive impact on the development level of the agricultural insurance in Xinjiang, while the industrial structure has a significant negative impact on the development level of the agricultural insurance in Xinjiang Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the support of rural compulsory education and vocational education, promote the integrated development of rural primary, secondary and tertiary industries, and increase the financial expenditure on agricultural development and the agricultural insurance, so as to improve the vulnerability of the agricultural drought and improve the development level of the agricultural insurance, so as to provide support for stabilizing agricultural production, protecting farmers’ rights and interests and realizing rural revitalization.},

abstract = {Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) have been thriving and widely deployed in recent years. In general, these systems receive sensor data, compute driving decisions, and output control signals to the vehicles. To smooth out the uncertainties brought by sensor outputs, they usually leverage multi-sensor fusion (MSF) to fuse the sensor outputs and produce a more reliable understanding of the surroundings. However, MSF cannot completely eliminate the uncertainties since it lacks the knowledge about which sensor provides the most accurate data and how to optimally integrate the data provided by the sensors. As a result, critical consequences might happen unexpectedly. In this work, we observed that the popular MSF methods in an industry-grade ADAS can mislead the car control and result in serious safety hazards. We define the failures (e.g., car crashes) caused by the faulty MSF as fusion errors and develop a novel evolutionary-based domain-specific search framework, FusED, for the efficient detection of fusion errors. We further apply causality analysis to show that the found fusion errors are indeed caused by the MSF method. We evaluate our framework on two widely used MSF methods in two driving environments. Experimental results show that FusED identifies more than 150 fusion errors. Finally, we provide several suggestions to improve the MSF methods we study.},

abstract = {With the development of modern industry towards large-scale and integration, the production process is becoming more and more complex. The process is seriously nonlinear, time-varying, uncertain and the strong combination of variables, which makes many systems lack accurate mathematical description and difficult to analyze and control with traditional theoretical methods. Therefore, it is necessary to study new intelligent control strategies. Real-time and efficient solution of the optimal path in a large-scale road network is a research difficulty in the field of dynamic path induction. During path planning, the robot's own sensors are required to continuously collect and analyze environmental data, so that the robot can find the target point and update it continuously path. Aiming at the shortcomings of the basic GA, such as low efficiency, when calculating the optimization problems of large-scale networks. In this paper, an intelligent route planning algorithm based on genetic neural network is proposed. The environmental information is obtained by five sensors loaded on the front end. The obtained obstacle, pose and target information are used as the input of neural network, and then the weights of neural network are trained and adjusted by GA. Finally, the output of neural network after training and adjustment is used as the driving control force of robot. On this basis, referring to some conclusions of fixture verification, the stability and deformation characteristics of the workpiece are simulated through some parameters, and the GA is used for combinatorial optimization to determine the optimal positioning point. The algorithm proposed in this paper has the advantages of simple calculation and fast convergence, can avoid some local extremum, and the planned collision free path reaches the shortest collision free path. Finally, through the experimental simulation of the algorithm, the results show that the proposed intelligent route planning algorithm based on genetic neural network is correct and effective. In addition, the real-time performance and rapidity are better than the basic GA, and the balance problem of solving efficiency and solving quality in large-scale road network is also solved.},

abstract = {High-performance scientific computing has become the core competitiveness of a country. Using advanced computing power to understand and solve complex scientific engineering problems. However, due to the lack of optical equipment, these understandings and records are relatively rough. With the development of technology, human beings have invented observation tools, which makes people's understanding and transformation of the world on the fast track. Effective solution on parallel computers: Many classical and modern disciplines or projects are related to the basic problem of system parameter determination. For a controlled system, find an optimal control scheme from the existing control schemes, so that the target performance index value can reach the optimal value. Thereby destroying the geometric structure of the image. This contradiction is especially obvious when the noise interference in the image is large. Theoretically, the larger the aperture of the telescope, the more incident light, and the higher the imaging resolution. Therefore, increasing the aperture of the telescope became the mainstream development direction of the telescope at that time. It is a lighting control equipment that uses photosensitive and infrared sensors to detect the light environment and single chip microcomputer to make decision and control. Although this method has simple structure, it still has the defects of single function, high misjudgment rate and unable to control according to the actual situation. However, with the increase of the scale of the problem, how to propose high-resolution, real-time response numerical algorithm has become a more urgent need. The image with large noise interference can also achieve good results in denoising, and has better filtering performance than the standard median filter, which provides an effective way to eliminate impulse noise in the image. This paper mainly aims at this problem, which has a large number of applications in the field of image processing and domain decomposition computing. Therefore, how to efficiently and optimally control the image processing method of parallel computing.},

In this context, our objective is to enhance the resilience of this crop. To achieve this goal, our work consists of detecting anomalies at early stage starting from the tree to the field scale. The proposed solution takes advantage of the emergence of satellites with high spatial and temporal resolution. In particular, the Sentinel-2 sensor which is well-adapted to monitor the vegetation. It is characterized by ten spectral bands allowing to access to key vegetation properties such as leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll content (Cab) and water content (Cw), etc. Direct estimation of these parameters for the image is not practical as the signal is convolved. For that, we use artificial intelligence techniques to separate the effects of the different properties. We develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that learn to estimate the vegetation properties given the pixel signature. The learning is done using a database of simulated data produced by a radiative transfer model that simulates the satellite image given the vegetation cover properties. The stress detection using threshold on tree LAI and Cab. Comparison with ground truth with healthy and stressed plots has shown the validity of our approach.},

abstract = {A widespread challenge in the industrial domain is the modernization and digitization of assembly processes involving human workers to increase production efficiency and thus stay competitive with rival companies. Specifically, in assembly processes involving low lot sizes, human workers are required to deal with variations to individual assembly work processes due to product customization. In case of complex tasks this leads to mistakes and further expensive dis- and reassembly steps. This paper investigates which are the quantifiably best data sources, pre-procession steps, features, and machine learning algorithms to determine the correct execution of a specific work process in the manufacturing environment. To answer this question, a wearable sensor system consisting of multiple heterogeneous sensor devices was developed. The data used for this work was specifically collected from the actual production environment in multiple recording sessions, and particular focus was given to achieve this in a realistic yet controlled way. An assistance provisioning pipeline for industrial workers consisting of (i) an activity recognition system, (ii) a work flow correlation engine, (iii) a wrench activity estimator and a (iv) feedback system was developed. These systems were designed and evaluated using authentic, task-specific expert knowledge and using a grid search study to determine the best selection of data sources, pre-procession steps, features, and machine learning algorithms. This study was able to answer the given research question and reifies the final results in the form of a guidance system to be deployed in an industrial manufacturing line.},

Mobile and modern smartwatch applications have great potential to provide early warning for medical emergencies, such as fever, oxygen saturation decline and, recently, Covid-19 disease. Furthermore, such apps can also track their position, if necessary, and even automatically detect wandering behaviour. In this paper, we propose a platform that will be able to a) automatically recognize health emergency situations and/or detection of wandering behaviour based on smartwatch/smartphone sensors, b) provide appropriate notifications to both user and caregiver when needed. The final system is currently developed within a Greek national research project and a pilot implementation will be evaluated by a Greek assistive center for people with ID.},

abstract = {Long-term sleep monitoring is essential in many vital health state monitoring applications, including detecting abnormal human behaviour during sleep to support the diagnosis of sleep disorders. Previous approaches to monitoring human behaviour during sleep have relied on inconvenient sensing methods such as wearable devices or intrusive sensing technologies, for example, cameras. This paper explores the potential application of the Thermal Sensor Array (TSA) to monitor human sleep. Humans usually cover their bodies during sleeping, affecting the TSA’s ability to sense their infrared radiation. This paper overcomes these challenges by proposing a series of motion-based signal processing rather than processing the human physical appearance in the TSA output. A deterministic approach has been utilised to examine the proposed approach to detect abnormal human movement during sleep.},

abstract = {Introduction: It is a priority to promote the autonomy and empowerment of patients and carers due to the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, improving their quality of life (QoL), and to provide tools aimed at improving monitoring by professionals. Remote monitoring of health parameters and lifestyles through devices is an emerging field in healthcare. The TeNDER project incorporates a wide variety of sensors and devices that are integrated into a single platform. The aim of this paper is to provide a description of the TeNDER ecosystem at home. Methodology: Based on the specific requirements of the social and health conditions of the patients, different scenarios of the system are designed. The TeNDER architecture follows a modular structure with multiple levels of functionality to provide person-specific services which are differentiated into three entities: the Low-Level Subsystem (LLS), the High-Level Subsystem (HLS), and the Services Layer (SL). Conclusions: The use of TeNDER in home environment can improve the QoL of patients and caregivers and improve clinical care by their healthcare professionals.},

abstract = {It is known in the current scientific literature that people living on the autism spectrum have a lower quality of sleep compared to neurotypical people, and the internal factors for this have already been well established. In focus groups with experts, it was pointed out that environmental factors (street noise, light sources, air quality, temperature, Vibrations) could also have a significant impact on sleep quality. A semi-structured literature search on assistive technology to cope with these issues revealed no relevant literature on this topic at the time of the investigation. A concept was set up in an iterative process based on the current literature. This concept includes a developed study design and three components: a sensor system for recording the environmental factors, and already existing technology (Withings Sleep Analyzer) for the contactless recording of physiological sleep data and a questionnaire to measure internal sleep-influencing factors. The results of this study will be used to develop appropriate sensor technology to collect and analyze sleep data, compare it with environmental factors, detect sleep-influencing factors and finally support caregivers and people living in the autism spectrum themselves.},

abstract = {Robotic systems are progressively integrated in many parts of our lives to a point where their acceptance is now extensive inside our society. Nevertheless, their social skills are still very limited when they navigate in human populated environments. It is well established, that the robotic motion in any populated environment requires awareness in order for the robot to be socially compliant and not constitute any danger to its surroundings. For this purpose, we have developed a framework for robotic human-aware navigation that can also be used as an installation framework in a totally unknown environment. Our contribution also involves a 3d human pose estimation and a human laser tracking module that are based on the rgb-d and laser sensors respectively. The outcome of our framework results in the adjustment of the robot’s path in accordance to the social norms. This way, the robot can navigate in its environment without intruding the personal space of the people inside it or disquiet them in any way. The potential of our framework was investigated through experiments that were conducted both in a simulation and real environments. The real environment where we experimented on consists a warehouse, but the algorithm results indicate that it could be easily implemented in domestic environments to aid other tasks like assisting living.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that is considered a major public health problem worldwide. The current diagnostic technology for TB detection is not efficient. Interferon-γ inducible protein 10 (IP-10) is a highly investigated biomarker for TB diagnosis. Nanobody (Nb) is a novel type of antibody fragment which can be produced in microorganisms at a low cost and could be used to replace mAb in diagnostics. This study focused on selection of a nanobody specific to IP-10. Phage display was used for the initial screening anti-IP-10 Nb from a synthetic library. Functional Ligand-binding Identification by Tat-based Recognition of Associating Proteins (FLI-TRAP) technique was then used for Nb isolation from the 1st round of phage biopanning. After FLI-TRAP selection, 11 out of 20 (55\%) randomly samples showed CB resistance at a single colony level representing potential anti-IP-10 Nbs. These candidates were sequence verified and 5 out of 11 (45\%) showed no stop codon within the Nb genes. With the new proposed method for verification of cell resistance due to Tat transport of Nb-IP-10 complex proposed in this study, it may be possible to obtain 100\% true positive identification. Successful identification of one anti-IP-10 Nb from this large size of a synthetic Nb is the first step. In the future, we could generate mutated library of this full-length Nb and use FLI-TRAP to identify other enhanced variants, which maybe suitable to be used in the development of a TB diagnostic kit that is more affordable, easy to store, and has a higher sensitivity and specificity.},

abstract = {This monitoring system aims at increasing the resilience of the road infrastructures and ensuring reliable network availability under unfavourable conditions, such as extreme weather, landslides, and earthquakes. The main target is to combine downscaled climate change scenarios (applied to road infrastructures) with simulation tools (structural/geotechnical) and actual data (from existing and novel sensors), so as to provide the operators with an integrated tool able to support more effective management of their infrastructures at planning, maintenance and operation level. Towards this, the proposed framework aims to use high resolution modelling data for the determination and the assessment of the climatic risk of the selected, transport infrastructures and associated expected damages, use existing SHM data (from accelerometers, strain gauges etc.) with new types of sensor-generated data (computer vision) to feed the structural/geotechnical simulator, utilize tailored weather forecasts (combining seamlessly all available data sources) for specific hot-spots, providing early warnings with corresponding impact assessment in real time; develop improved multi-temporal, multi-sensor UAV, computer vision and machine learning-based damage diagnostic for diverse transport infrastructures; design and implement a Holistic Resilience Assessment Platform environment as an innovative planning tool that will permit a quantitative resilience assessment through an end-to-end simulation environment, running “what-if” impact/risk/resilience assessment scenarios. The effects of adaptation measures can be investigated by changing the hazard, exposure and vulnerability input parameters; design and implement a Common Operational Picture, including an enhanced visualisation interface and an Incident Management System. The integrated platform (and its sub-modules) will be validated in two real case studies in Spain and in Greece.},

abstract = {The popularity of wearables and their seamless integration into our daily lives have transformed these devices into an appealing resource to deploy automatic fall detection systems. During last years, a massive literature on new methods and algorithms for these wearable detectors has been produced. However, in most cases these algorithms are tested against one single (or at best two) datasets containing signals captured from falls and conventional movements. This work evaluates the behavior of a fall detection system based on a convolutional neural network when different public repositories of movements are alternatively used for training and testing the model. After a systematic cross-dataset evaluation involving four well-known datasets, we show the difficulty of extrapolating the results achieved by a certain classifier for a particular database when another dataset is considered. Results seem to indicate that classification methods tend to overlearn the particular conditions (typology of movements, characteristics of the employed sensor, experimental subjects) under which the training samples were generated.},

In this paper we investigate whether an evolutionary approach can mitigate this problem. We consider a very challenging task where robots with limited sensing and communication abilities must follow the gradient of an environmental feature and use Differential Evolution to evolve a neural network controller for simulated robots. We conduct a systematic study to measure the flexibility and scalability of the method by varying the size of the arena and number of robots in the swarm. The experiments confirm the feasibility of our approach, the evolved robot controllers induced swarm behavior that solved the task. We found that solutions evolved under the harshest conditions (where the environmental clues were the weakest) were the most flexible and that there is a sweet spot regarding the swarm size. Furthermore, we observed collective motion of the swarm, showcasing truly emergent behavior that was not represented in-and selected for during evolution.},

abstract = {Since the key factors affecting the fuel consumption of the long-distance vehicle are varied hourly on the whole truck running routes, which are long distance and stretched to various environmental district, the amount of saving fuel consumption must be limited until the following two things would have become able to do. The first is a better fuel-efficient driving control in terms of the low/high gear, accel, and the idling by increasing the driver's skills based on the training and driving assist systems that makes it possible to find own problem. And the second is a better mechanical maintenance to keep a better fuel-efficiency. Thus, this paper proposes a machine learning based time and environment condition dependency aware fuel consumption tracking method, which enables to give the timely feedback to the drivers and truck maintenance facility. The feedback will be given by making clearer what are the key factors affecting fuel consumption every period based on their time and environment dependencies analysis results. Since the various data obtained by the embedded sensors (CANbus &amp;GPS) are complicated and its number of variables is over 100 (much larger than the conventional cases of less than 50), we initially used the LightGBM but we faced the bias vs variance tradeoff issue. To address this issue, we newly proposed the stacking scheme, which optimizes the trade-off by combining the random forest, the SVM, and the LightGBM. Thanks to this scheme, the variance (RMSE) error was reduced from 6.04 to 5.03, while keeping the best accuracy (R2) of 97.6\%. We proposed the feedback system to reduce the fuel consumption based on the analysis of the key influencing factors that caused by the drivers. To our best knowledge, it is the first time to demonstrate that the saving of overall fuel consumption by the proposed feedback scheme can be reduced by 8\% if some key factors could be carefully reduced by 50\%.},

abstract = {Satellite remote sensing data products are widely used in many applications and science domains ranging from agriculture and emergency management to Earth and environmental sciences. Researchers have developed sophisticated and computationally intensive models for processing and analyzing such data with varying spatiotemporal resolutions from multiple sources. However, the computational intensity and expertise in using advanced cyberinfrastructure have held back the scalability and reproducibility of such models. To tackle this challenge, this research employs the CyberGIS-Compute middleware to achieve scalable and reproducible remote sensing data fusion across multiple spatiotemporal resolutions by harnessing advanced cyberinfrastructure. CyberGIS-Compute is a cyberGIS middleware framework for conducting computationally intensive geospatial analytics with advanced cyberinfrastructure resources such as those provisioned by XSEDE. Our case study achieved remote sensing data fusion at high spatial and temporal resolutions based on integrating CyberGIS-Compute with a cutting-edge deep learning model. This integrated approach also demonstrates how to achieve computational reproducibility of scalable remote sensing data fusion.},

abstract = {Post-operative complications and hospital readmission are of great concern to surgical patients and health care providers. Wearable devices such as Fitbit wristbands enable long-term and non-intrusive monitoring of patients outside clinical environments. To build accurate predictive models based on wearable data, however, requires effective feature engineering to extract high-level features from time series data collected by the wearable sensors. This paper presents a pipeline for developing clinical predictive models based on wearable sensors. The core of the pipeline is a multi-level feature engineering framework for extracting high-level features from fine-grained time series data. The framework integrates a set of techniques tailored for noisy and incomplete wearable data collected in real-world clinical studies: (1) singular spectrum analysis for extracting high-level features from daily features over the course of the study; (2) a set of daily features that are resilient to missing data in wearable time series data; (3) a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) method for imputing short missing heart rate segments; (4) the integration of patients' clinical characteristics and wearable features. We evaluated the feature engineering approach and machine learning models in a clinical study involving 61 patients undergoing pancreatic surgery. Linear support vector machine (SVM) with integrated feature engineering achieved an AUROC of 0.8802 for predicting post-operative readmission or severe complications, which significantly outperformed the existing rule-based model used in clinical practice and other state-of-the-art feature engineering approaches.},

abstract = {The ubiquity of Wi-Fi infrastructure has facilitated the development of a range of Wi-Fi based sensing applications. Wi-Fi sensing relies on weak signal reflections from the human target and thus only supports a limited sensing range, which significantly hinders the real-world deployment of the proposed sensing systems. To extend the sensing range, traditional algorithms focus on suppressing the noise introduced by the imperfect Wi-Fi hardware. This paper picks a different direction and proposes to enhance the quality of the sensing signal by fully exploiting the signal diversity provided by the Wi-Fi hardware. We propose DiverSense, a system that combines sensing signal received from all subcarriers and all antennas in the array, to fully utilize the spatial and frequency diversity. To guarantee the diversity gain after signal combining, we also propose a time-diversity based signal alignment algorithm to align the phase of the multiple received sensing signals. We implement the proposed methods in a respiration monitoring system using commodity Wi-Fi devices and evaluate the performance in diverse environments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DiverSense is able to accurately monitor the human respiration even when the sensing signal is under noise floor, and therefore boosts sensing range to 40 meters, which is a 3x improvement over the current state-of-the-art. DiverSense also works robustly under NLoS scenarios, e.g., DiverSense is able to accurately monitor respiration even when the human and the Wi-Fi transceivers are separated by two concrete walls with wooden doors.},

abstract = {This paper presents ssLOTR (self-supervised learning on the rings), a system that shows the feasibility of designing self-supervised learning based techniques for 3D finger motion tracking using a custom-designed wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor with a minimal overhead of labeled training data. Ubiquitous finger motion tracking enables a number of applications in augmented and virtual reality, sign language recognition, rehabilitation healthcare, sports analytics, etc. However, unlike vision, there are no large-scale training datasets for developing robust machine learning (ML) models on wearable devices. ssLOTR designs ML models based on data augmentation and self-supervised learning to first extract efficient representations from raw IMU data without the need for any training labels. The extracted representations are further trained with small-scale labeled training data. In comparison to fully supervised learning, we show that only 15\% of labeled training data is sufficient with self-supervised learning to achieve similar accuracy. Our sensor device is designed using a two-layer printed circuit board (PCB) to minimize the footprint and uses a combination of Polylactic acid (PLA) and Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) as housing materials for sturdiness and flexibility. It incorporates a system-on-chip (SoC) microcontroller with integrated WiFi/Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) modules for real-time wireless communication, portability, and ubiquity. In contrast to gloves, our device is worn like rings on fingers, and therefore, does not impede dexterous finger motion. Extensive evaluation with 12 users depicts a 3D joint angle tracking accuracy of 9.07° (joint position accuracy of 6.55mm) with robustness to natural variation in sensor positions, wrist motion, etc, with low overhead in latency and power consumption on embedded platforms.},

abstract = {Deep inertial sequence learning has shown promising odometric resolution over model-based approaches for trajectory estimation in GPS-denied environments. However, existing neural inertial dead-reckoning frameworks are not suitable for real-time deployment on ultra-resource-constrained (URC) devices due to substantial memory, power, and compute bounds. Current deep inertial odometry techniques also suffer from gravity pollution, high-frequency inertial disturbances, varying sensor orientation, heading rate singularity, and failure in altitude estimation. In this paper, we introduce TinyOdom, a framework for training and deploying neural inertial models on URC hardware. TinyOdom exploits hardware and quantization-aware Bayesian neural architecture search (NAS) and a temporal convolutional network (TCN) backbone to train lightweight models targetted towards URC devices. In addition, we propose a magnetometer, physics, and velocity-centric sequence learning formulation robust to preceding inertial perturbations. We also expand 2D sequence learning to 3D using a model-free barometric g-h filter robust to inertial and environmental variations. We evaluate TinyOdom for a wide spectrum of inertial odometry applications and target hardware against competing methods. Specifically, we consider four applications: pedestrian, animal, aerial, and underwater vehicle dead-reckoning. Across different applications, TinyOdom reduces the size of neural inertial models by 31\texttimes{} to 134\texttimes{} with 2.5m to 12m error in 60 seconds, enabling the direct deployment of models on URC devices while still maintaining or exceeding the localization resolution over the state-of-the-art. The proposed barometric filter tracks altitude within ±0.1m and is robust to inertial disturbances and ambient dynamics. Finally, our ablation study shows that the introduced magnetometer, physics, and velocity-centric sequence learning formulation significantly improve localization performance even with notably lightweight models.},

abstract = {Conversational agents are increasingly becoming digital partners in our everyday computational experiences. Although rich and fresh in content, they are oblivious to users' locality beyond geospatial weather and traffic conditions. We introduce Lingo, a hyper-local conversational agent embedded deeply into the urban infrastructure that provides rich, purposeful, detailed, and in some cases, playful information relevant to a neighbourhood. Drawing lessons from a mixed-method contextual study (online survey, n = 1992 and semi-structured interviews, n = 21), we identify requirements for such a hyper-local conversational agent and a sample set of questions serving urban neighbourhoods of Belgium. Our agent design is manifested into a two-part system. First, a multi-modal reasoning engine serves as a hyper-local information source using automated machine-learning models operating on camera, microphone, and environmental sensor data. Second, a smart conversational speaker and a smartphone application serve as hyper-local information access points. Finally, we introduce a covert communication mechanism over Wi-Fi management frames that bridges the two parts of our Lingo system and enables the privacy-preserving proxemic interactions. We describe the design, implementation, and technical assessment of Lingo together with usability (n = 20) and real-world deployment (n = 5) studies. We reflect on information quality, accessibility benefits, and interaction dynamics and demonstrate the efficacy of Lingo in offering hyper-local information at the finest granularity in urban neighbourhoods while reducing access time up to a factor of 25.},
