abstract = {Radar signal recognition has a guiding role for electronic warfare systems. The traditional radar signal recognition method confirms the target model through signal feature comparison, which is suitable for electromagnetic environments with single radar signal and low signal feature complexity. With the continuous development of radar technology, traditional radar signal recognition methods have been difficult to adapt to target recognition in complex electromagnetic environments. In order to improve the accuracy of radar signal recognition in complex electromagnetic environments, this paper proposed a radar signal recognition method based on transfer learning. At first, the proposed method performed pre-processing operations on the initial signal data collected by the sensor, including normalization, noise truncation, feature extraction, etc., and established a database for the processed signal data. Afterwards, a feedforward BP neural network model was trained to classify the signal data. Finally, on the basis of the transfer learning, pulse characteristic parameters (radio frequency, etc.) were added to the output layer of the feedforward BP neural network, it served as a new input layer to train deeper network models, making it adaptive and deviation-resistant. The feasibility of the proposed method was verified with six sets of different sample data. The results showed that the average recognition accuracy of the method in this paper reached 93.3\%, compared with the traditional ANN-based method, the average recognition accuracy is improved by 12\%, which verifies the reliability of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Differential expression gene (DEG) analysis of transcriptomic data allows for a comprehensive examination of the regulation in gene expression profiles related to specific biological states. The result of this analysis typically consists of an extensive record of genes that display varying levels of expression among two or more groups. A portion of these genes with altered expression could potentially function as candidate biomarkers, chosen through either existing biological insights or data-driven techniques. In diagnosing sepsis, a life-threatening health problem, our work proposes a novel approach using immune-related gene data to identify the optimal gene combination as signature biomarkers to improve the diagnosis performance. Our proposed method involves sequential gene selection procedures, including the DEG analysis and the machine learning-based importance assessment, and a Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) process supported by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The selected gene combination, which consists of twelve immune-related genes, shows remarkable cross-validation results with an accuracy of 99.35\%, AUC score of 99.56\%, Sensitivity and a Specificity of 99.44\% and 90.00\%, respectively. Besides, the proposed 12 gene markers combined with the XGBoost algorithm were also tested in three individual cohorts with appropriately significant results, demonstrating the effectiveness of our developed method in different cohorts and the reliability of the proposed gene selection procedure.},

abstract = {The onboarding process refers to the organizational integration or socialization of new employees to the company and their role. This includes training, orientation, support, and communication, seeking to help newcomers to adapt to the new culture and work environment. Since software development is a human activity that requires collaboration and teamwork, especially in the professional environment, onboarding is a critical process to ensure the proper integration of new employees in software projects. Thus, this paper aims to identify the main approaches, practices, trends, and challenges related to the onboarding process in the Software Engineering context. We conducted a Systematic Mapping Study, which resulted in the selection of 23 primary studies. The main findings include the observation that onboarding process is context-sensitive, affected by characterisctics such as organization size, work model, and development methodologies. We also found that there is a lack of studies evaluating models and tools. Finally, there is a heavy focus on oboarding activities related to learning and socialization, in contrast to developing the confidence of newcomers.},

abstract = {The VALERIE tool pipeline is a synthetic data generator [14] developed with the goal to contribute to the understanding of domain-specific factors that influence perception performance of DNNs (deep neural networks). This work was carried out under the German research project KI Absicherung in order to develop a methodology for the validation of DNNs in the context of pedestrian detection in urban environments for automated driving. The VALERIE22 dataset was generated with the VALERIE procedural tools pipeline providing a photorealistic sensor simulation rendered from automatically synthesized scenes. The dataset provides a uniquely rich set of metadata, allowing extraction of specific scene and semantic features (like pixel-accurate occlusion rates, positions in the scene and distance + angle to the camera). This enables a multitude of possible tests on the data and we hope to stimulate research on understanding performance of DNNs. Based on cross-domain semantic segmentation experiments, i.e. training on synthetic data and evaluation on target real world data, a comparison with several other publicly available datasets is provided, demonstrating that VALERIE22 is one of best performing synthetic datasets currently available in the open domain. 1},

abstract = {Landslides are hazards triggered from natural factors such as geomorphology and climatic phenomena. The impacts of these events are not negligible in terms of both economic and social impacts, therefore the topic of remote monitoring structural health monitoring has become important for geologic applications. Nowadays several technologies are evolving and allowing new structures for sensor networks. Among these, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) represent a particularly well suited solution thanks to the flexibility that these structures offer. In this paper, an urban monitoring system based on WSN is presented. It is aimed to monitor the structural health of housings located on a hillside where a land movement happens. The inclination of the buildings must be monitored for safety purposes in order to enable preventive maintenance, and an evacuation plan. The network is composed of Long Range (LoRa) based sensor nodes arranged in a star topology with respect to a central gateway. The network access is provided using LoRaWAN Media Access Layer (MAC). The system is based on an Internet Of Things (IoT) structure, allowing the access to data and reports trough an online platform. The paper reports a system description of hardware and functionality of all the devices, a description of the remote monitoring web section, a power analysis, radio coverage analysis, and real scenario data.},

abstract = {In the past few years, the development of Industry 4.0 has driven the demand for automation equipment in factories, thereby requiring better real-time monitoring tools to control the factory environment and equipment. Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), as an important component of Industry 4.0, utilizes the capabilities of smart machines and real-time analytics to collect relevant data through various sensors, monitors, and other monitoring technologies deployed on devices, in order to improve operational efficiency. However, as the boundary between Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) is rapidly disappearing, OT environments now require dedicated solutions for OT and IoT security. Due to the differences in packet features and labels collected in each domain, this study focuses on proposing a joint transfer learning approach combined with an intrusion detection system, and simulates datasets collected from different domains using three OT-related public datasets: Edge-IIoTset, WUSTL-IIOT-2021 Dataset, and Electra dataset (Modbus). It discusses the issues related to different attack types and dataset features. In addition, we compare the effects of different deep learning models on intrusion detection systems. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach of bidirectional federated transfer learning enables cooperative learning of heterogeneous data.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a cross body signal pairing (CBSPCR) protocol to enable key generation between wearable devices with cardiac and respiratory sensors. Most previous pairing protocols require both wearable devices to access the same biometric signal for pairing. The restriction can greatly limit communication between wearable devices and the development of new applications on the devices. We implemented CBSPCR for pairing wearable devices based on respiratory and cardiac signals. Two pairing modes are proposed for the pairing: (1) The model-based pairing is based on mathematical models between respiratory and cardiac signals. (2) The extraction-based pairing is based on the extraction of respiratory signals from cardiac signals. The pairing performance of these two modes varies with exercise intensity. To take full advantage of both pairing modes, we developed a mode switching based on the respiration rate, a reliable indicator of exercise intensity level. CBSPCR uses Lloyd-Max quantization and a BCH-based mismatch correction method to digitize the signals and correct mismatches between bit-strings. Our extensive experiments with 30 participants show that CBSPCR can generate about 0.0125 keys per second with high resistance to impersonation attacks and negligible battery consumption.},

abstract = {The management and maintenance of industrial equipment is indispensable in business environments, as it corresponds to a significant portion of a company's budget. Therefore, the use of a system that monitors the equipment and alerts managers when maintenance, repair and/or replacement tasks are required, lowers costs related to these tasks and the equipment involved. Based on this premise, the Smartool digital platform described in this paper was developed. It can store, process and alarm maintenance managers, considering data acquired from equipment, its monitoring points, sensors, and associated measurements. The platform is composed of two main software applications. A backend application where Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) strategies are implemented using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, and a frontend web application where the user can choose the strategy to be used in predicting the next maintenance of a given equipment. In terms of business logic, the platform executes these algorithms to access the condition of the equipment, its evolution, and the prediction of how it will evolve in each period, to help users decide about the ideal moment for maintenance. The developed platform was designed to be generic and scalable and can be used for any type of equipment and measurements, allowing also for easy addition of new algorithms and/or maintenance strategies. The solution developed allows the management of existing equipment in an organization, as well as checking its operating status and calculating forecasts of how it may evolve in terms of maintenance/replacement needs.},

abstract = {Mobile robots are increasingly being utilized as guides in various settings. Ensuring efficient and hospitable interactions between robots and individuals is crucial for their successful implementation. However, there is a lack of understanding regarding the specific robot behaviors that can effectively guide individuals to their destinations while providing a sense of hospitality. In this study, we investigate two robot behaviors: “vertical oscillation motion” and “looking back motion,” with the objective of identifying behaviors that can optimize efficiency and hospitality in a guide robot. The vertical oscillation motion replicates the natural up-and-down movement of the human body during walking, while the looking back motion establishes eye contact and conveys a sense of hospitality. To evaluate the effectiveness of these behaviors, we conducted experiments with actual visitors at a shopping mall. Participants were exposed to the robot's behaviors and their responses were analyzed through questionnaires and interviews. The results revealed that the looking back motion successfully conveyed the robot's hospitality, while the vertical oscillation motion instilled a sense of urgency in individuals. However, it was found that only the looking back motion effectively motivated individuals to promptly commence walking towards the robot. These findings highlight the significance of incorporating specific robot behaviors to enhance both efficiency and hospitality in guiding individuals to their destinations. By understanding the impact of these behaviors, we can develop guide robots that accommodate a larger number of individuals while increasing their satisfaction. Future research endeavors should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of these behaviors in real-world environments, ensuring their practical applicability.},

abstract = {Climate data forms the basis of our understanding of how the climate system works. Climate change research is now impacting strategy and policy decision-making in a wide variety of areas, ranging from water management to public lands, health, and navigation. For climate change research, data needs to be collected for prolonged periods of time and in the most extensive number of locations possible, guaranteeing the highest accuracy and completeness possible. IoT networks can play an important role in collecting these data, helping to monitor and even tackle climate change, however just a minority of the existing IoT devices that could serve for this purpose are currently exploited. In this paper we introduce a novel solution that enables existing IoT devices to share data through direct communication between the sensor and the receiver. IoT device owners are motivated to share data through an incentive system based on device-to-device small payments. The data and payment exchange is recorded immutably using blockchain technology, removing unnecessary third parties and guaranteeing auditability. Moreover, the solution provides privacy through a distributed key infrastructure signature system. A prototype of the solution is implemented to demonstrate its feasibility.},

abstract = {Wildfires result in extensive damage and pose significant threats to the natural environment and human society. Accurate and timely assessment of wildfire damage is critical for effective post-fire management and restoration efforts. Much progress has been made for monitoring and mapping burned areas based on manual feature extraction and machine learning. However, current approaches are often hindered by several limitations, including poor generalizability, complex and time-consuming procedures, and a primary focus on binary classification, only distinguishing between burned and non-burned areas. As such, this paper intends to develop an advanced framework that not only can reliably detect burned areas, but also has the capability to assess the burn severity (low, medium and high) for the detected areas. Within this framework, pixel-wise multiclass models for detecting wildfire burn severity level are developed based on the standard U-Net architecture using pre- and post-fire Sentinel-2 remote sensing images. The experimental results demonstrated the power of the Bi-temporal U-Net model for both multi-class and binary mapping of wildfire detection, achieving an overall accuracy (OA) of over 95\%, and outperformed baseline algorithms, including fully convolutional network, random forest, eXtreme gradient boosting, and support vector machine, with an average improvement of 18\% in F1-score and 15\% in mean intersection over union.},

However, the impact of eye and face tracking with personalized avatars is yet to be explored. In this paper, we investigate the impact of eye and face tracking on embodiment, enfacement, and the uncanny valley with four types of avatars using a VR-based mirroring task. We conducted a study (N=12) and created self-avatars with two rendering styles: a cartoon avatar (created in an avatar generator using a picture of the user’s face) and a photorealistic scanned avatar (created using a 3D scanner), each with and without eye and face tracking and respective adaptation of the mirror image. Our results indicate that adding eye and face tracking can be beneficial for certain enfacement scales (belonged), and we confirm that compared to a cartoon avatar, a scanned realistic avatar results in higher body ownership and increased enfacement (own face, belonging, mirror) — regardless of eye and face tracking. We critically discuss our experiences and outline the limitations of the applied hardware and software with respect to the provided level of control and the applicability for complex tasks such as displaying emotions. We synthesize these findings into a discussion about potential improvements for facial animation in VR and highlight the need for a better level of control, the integration of additional sensing and processing technologies, and an objective metric for comparing facial animation systems.},

abstract = {Human physiological monitoring has become easily accessible by integrating wearable devices into our lives, providing valuable real-time data. Methods for Cognitive Workload (CW) estimation utilize such physiological data to quantify CW during task execution. These methods are crucial for various domains, including mobile healthcare, forecasting human errors, and human-machine interaction. However, accurately estimating CW continues to pose a challenge due to the absence of objective ground truth data, context dependency, and the privacy sensitivity of the data. This study tackled the complex task of estimating CW based on privacy-sensitive data (e.g., eye movement, pupil diameter, blink information, and other physiological signals) using Federated Learning (FL) methods to improve user privacy. We compared the outcomes of the FL models with the more conventional centralized approach on two publicly-available datasets COLET and ADABase, which include data from 75 participants overall. The results highlight the efficacy of FL in collaboratively training a global (person-independent) model. The FL models achieved performances on par with centralized state-of-the-art models while preserving data privacy. Recognizing the importance of privacy in user sensing, FL presents a promising approach that enables wearable sensing applications in privacy-sensitive domains.},

This has presented significant challenges for software development teams to swiftly adjust to the market needs and demand. To address these challenges, product management teams have had to adapt their approach to software development, reshaping their processes to meet the demands of the pandemic. Brighsquid implemented a new task assignment process aimed at enhancing developer accountability toward the customer. To assess the impact of this change on code ownership, we conducted a code change analysis. Additionally, we surveyed 67 developers to investigate the relationship between accountability and ownership more broadly. The findings of our case study indicate that the revised assignment model not only increased the perceived sense of accountability within the production team but also improved code resilience against ownership changes. Moreover, the survey results revealed that a majority of the participating developers (67.5\%) associated perceived accountability with artifact ownership.},

abstract = {Poverty alleviation is an important goal set by the UN which aims to improve the lives of a large number of people around the world, especially in developing countries. One of the challenges in achieving this goal is being able to measure wealth level frequently, inexpensively, and with high spatial granularity. There are surveys that measure wealth level, however these are conducted only every 4 to 5 years, require high costs in terms of logistics and manpower, or are only accurate at the provincial level. One alternative is to use deep learning models to estimate wealth levels using satellite images. However, this is cost-prohibitive due to the requirement of significant compute resources to train these models. We build upon an existing approach of measuring wealth level in the Philippines using machine learning and tabular data and we obtained an R2 of 0.68, MAPE of 22.71\%, and MAE of 7.8, which is better by 0.05 in R2 than the results of a previous study utilizing deep learning and satellite images. For urban areas, our model can achieve an even better MAPE of 13.9\%. The performance improvement can be attributed to the addition of new data (e.g. environmental, demographics, remote sensing indices) which provide additional context to the model. Additionally, we discover that the use of automatically collected data such as remote sensing data and environmental data provides comparable results (R2 of 0.66) and thus can be used as an alternative data source when manually created points of interest data are unavailable. Furthermore, we observe that environmental data and points of interest data contribute the most to the prediction of wealth level for urban and rural clusters. For future research directions, we recommend to explore the differences between urban and rural clusters, and to use deep learning as a supplement, especially for areas with limited data sources.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things-enabled Smart Healthcare System (IoT-SHS) is a networked infrastructure of intelligent wearables, software applications, health systems, and services that continuously monitors and transmits patient-sensitive data using an open wireless channel. The conventional security mechanisms are unsuitable for detecting attacks in the dynamic IoT-SHS context due to resource limitations and heterogeneity in low-cost healthcare devices. Deep Learning (DL) solutions for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and softwarization of the network has the potential to achieve secure network services in the IoT-SHS environment. Motivated by the aforementioned discussion, we propose an intelligent softwarized IDS for protecting the critical infrastructure of the IoT-SHS ecosystem. Specifically, the DL-based IDS is designed using a hybrid cuda Long Short-Term Memory Deep Neural Network (cuLSTM-DNN) algorithm to assist network administrators in efficient decision-making for the generated intrusions. To further bolster the system’s resilience, we suggest a deployment architecture for the proposed CUDA-powered IDS using OpenStack Tacker in a real SDN environment, ensuring that virtual machines can directly utilize the host’s NVIDIA GPU, thereby streamlining and enhancing the network’s operational efficiency. The experimental results using the CICDDoS2019 dataset confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework over some baseline and recent state-of-the-art techniques.},

abstract = {Trusted execution environments like Intel SGX provide enclaves, which offer strong security guarantees for applications. Running entire applications inside enclaves is possible, but this approach leads to a large trusted computing base (TCB). As such, various tools have been developed to partition programs written in languages such as C or Java into trusted and untrusted parts, which are run in and out of enclaves respectively. However, those tools depend on language-specific taint-analysis and partitioning techniques. They cannot be reused for other languages and there is thus a need for tools that transcend this language barrier.We address this challenge by proposing a multi-language technique to specify sensitive code or data, as well as a multi-language tool to analyse and partition the resulting programs for trusted execution environments like Intel SGX. We leverage GraalVM's Truffle framework, which provides a language-agnostic abstract syntax tree (AST) representation for programs, to provide special AST nodes called secure nodes that encapsulate sensitive program information. Secure nodes can easily be embedded into the ASTs of a wide range of languages via Truffle's polyglot API. Our technique includes a multi-language dynamic taint tracking tool to analyse and partition applications based on our generic secure nodes. Our extensive evaluation with micro- and macro-benchmarks shows that we can use our technique for two languages (Javascript and Python), and that partitioned programs can obtain up to 14.5\% performance improvement as compared to unpartitioned versions.},

abstract = {Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) can perform computations on encrypted data, allowing us to analyze sensitive data without losing its security. The main issue for FHE is its lower performance, especially for high-precision computations, compared to calculations on plaintext data. Making FHE viable for practical use requires both algorithmic improvements and hardware acceleration. Recently, Klemsa and \"{O} nen (CODASPY'22) presented fast homomorphic algorithms for high-precision integers, including addition, multiplication and some fundamental functions, by utilizing a technique called redundant representation. Their algorithms were applied on TFHE, which was proposed by Chillotti et al. (Asiacrypt'16). In this paper, we further accelerate this method by extending their algorithms to multithreaded environments. The experimental results show that our approach performs 128-bit addition in 0.41 seconds, 32-bit multiplication in 4.3 seconds, and 128-bit Max and ReLU functions in 1.4 seconds using a Tesla V100S server.},

abstract = {Real-world process control requires continuous sensor measurements and automatic control of the environment. Typical process control systems consist of three main components: controllers functioning as the system's "brain'', sensors acting as measurement devices, and final control elements that modify the environment. Prior works showed that adversaries could inject signals into analog sensors to affect the control process; however, an adversarial controller that is necessary to achieve process control is inherently missing in conventional physical-level sensor signal injection attacks, which revealed mechanisms to perturb sensor systems but did not describe the computations necessary to adjust and regulate the process over time. This paper introduces an adversarial control loop approach that computes attack signals during the attack to guide the adversarial process control. Our approach allows constructing the external "brain'' of the adversarial process control with programs. Further, we characterize the Physical Feedback Side Channel (PFSC) in out-of-band signal injection attacks, and study how the adversarial prototype system can be constructed non-invasively to gain control over two types of inertial sensor-actuator systems, including a MegaWheels self-balancing scooter. We demonstrate proof-of-concept process control without accessing or tampering with internal modules of the victim system.},

abstract = {Control systems are ubiquitous and often at the core of Cyber-Physical Systems, like cars and aeroplanes. They are implemented as embedded software that interacts in closed loop with the physical world through sensors and actuators. As a consequence, the software cannot just be tested in isolation. To close the loop in a testing environment and root causing failure generated by different parts of the system, executable models are used to abstract specific components. Different testing setups can be implemented by abstracting different elements: The most common ones are model-in-the-loop, software-in-the-loop, hardware-in-the-loop, and real-physics-in-the-loop. In this article, we discuss the properties of these setups and the types of faults they can expose. We develop a comprehensive case study using the Crazyflie, a drone whose software and hardware are open source. We implement all the most common testing setups and ensure the consistent injection of faults in each of them. We inject faults in the control system and we compare with the nominal performance of the non-faulty software. Our results show the specific capabilities of the different setups in exposing faults. Contrary to intuition and previous literature, we show that the setups do not belong to a strict hierarchy, and they are best designed to maximize the differences across them rather than to be as close as possible to reality.},

abstract = {Wireless sensing has emerged as a powerful environmental sensing technology that is vulnerable to the impact of all kinds of ambient noises. LoRa is a novel interference-resilient technology of low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN), which has attracted wide attention from scientific and industrial communities. However, LoRa transmission suffers from serious latency in those complex wireless sensing environments requiring transmission reliability. In this article, we present CH-MAC, the first MAC-layer protocol based on the local corruption nature of packets and the time-varying nature of channels to reduce end-to-end transmission latency in LPWAN with reliable communication requirements. Specifically, CH-MAC employs Luby Transform code to divide and encode the payload into several blocks such that the receiver can retain part of the coded information in the corrupted packets. In addition, CH-MAC utilizes hopping to transmit different blocks of a packet with various channels to avoid sudden noise collision. Moreover, CH-MAC adopts a dynamic packet length adjustment mechanism to mitigate network congestion. Extensive evaluations on a real-world hardware testbed and a simulation platform show that CH-MAC can reduce end-to-end transmission latency by 2.63\texttimes{} with a communication success rate requirement of &gt;95\% compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {People usually form a social structure (e.g., a leader-follower, companion, or independent group) for better interactions among them and thus share similar perceptions of visible scenes and invisible wireless signals encountered while moving. Many mobility-driven applications have paid much attention to recognizing trajectory relationships among people. This work models visual and wireless data to quantify the trajectory similarity between a pair of users. We design a visual and wireless sensor fusion system, called ViWise, which incorporates the first-person video frames collected by a wearable visual device and the wireless packets broadcast by a personal mobile device for recognizing finer-grained trajectory relationships within a mobility group. When people take similar trajectories, they usually share similar visual scenes. Their wireless packets observed by ambient wireless base stations (called wireless scanners in this work) usually contain similar patterns. We model the visual characteristics of physical objects seen by a user from two perspectives: micro-scale image structure with pixel-wise features and macro-scale semantic context. However, we model characteristics of wireless packets based on the encountered wireless scanners along the user’s trajectory. Given two users’ trajectories, their trajectory characteristics behind the visible video frames and invisible wireless packets are fused together to compute the visual-wireless data similarity that quantifies the correlation between trajectories taken by them. We exploit modeled visual-wireless data similarity to recognize the social structure within user trajectories. Comprehensive experimental results in indoor and outdoor environments show that the proposed ViWise is robust in trajectory relationship recognition with an accuracy of above 90\%.},

abstract = {Early detection of fatigue driving is pivotal for the safety of drivers and pedestrians. Traditional approaches mainly employ cameras and wearable sensors to detect fatigue features, which are intrusive to drivers. Recent advances in radio frequency (RF) sensing enable non-intrusive fatigue feature detection from the signal reflected by driver’s body. However, existing RF-based solutions only detect partial or coarse-grained fatigue features, which reduces the detection accuracy. To tackle the above limitations, we propose a mmWave-based fatigue driving detection system, called mmDrive, which can detect multiple fine-grained fatigue features from different body parts. However, achieving accurate detection of various fatigue features during driving encounters practical challenges. Specifically, normal driving activities and driver’s involuntary facial movements inevitably cause interference to fatigue features. Thus, we exploit unique geometric and behavioral characteristics of fatigue features and design effective signal processing methods to remove noises from fatigue-irrelevant activities. Based on the detected fatigue features, we further develop a fatigue determination algorithm to decide the driver’s fatigue state. Extensive experiment results from both simulated and real driving environments show that the average accuracy for detecting nodding and yawning features is about 96\%, and the average errors for estimating eye blink, respiration, and heartbeat rates are around 2.21 bpm, 0.54 bpm, and 2.52 bpm, respectively. And the accuracy of the fatigue detection algorithm we proposed reached 97.63\%.},

abstract = {As many types of IoT devices worm their way into numerous settings and many aspects of our daily lives, awareness of their presence and functionality becomes a source of major concern. Hidden IoT devices can snoop (via sensing) on nearby unsuspecting users, and impact the environment where unaware users are present, via actuation. This prompts, respectively, privacy and security/safety issues. The dangers of hidden IoT devices have been recognized and prior research suggested some means of mitigation, mostly based on traffic analysis or using specialized hardware to uncover devices. While such approaches are partially effective, there is currently no comprehensive approach to IoT device transparency.Prompted in part by recent privacy regulations (GDPR and CCPA), this paper1 motivates and constructs a privacy-agile Root-of-Trust architecture for IoT devices, called PAISA: &lt;u&gt;P&lt;/u&gt;rivacy-&lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;gile &lt;u&gt;I&lt;/u&gt;oT &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;ensing and &lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;ctuation. It guarantees timely and secure announcements of nearby IoT devices' presence and their capabilities. PAISA has two components: one on the IoT device that guarantees periodic announcements of its presence even if all device software is compromised, and the other on the user device, which captures and processes announcements. PAISA requires no hardware modifications; it uses a popular off-the-shelf Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) -- ARM TrustZone. To demonstrate its viability, PAISA is instantiated as an open-source prototype which includes: an IoT device that makes announcements via IEEE 802.11 WiFi beacons and an Android smartphone-based app that captures and processes announcements. Security and performance of PAISA design and its prototype are also discussed.},

abstract = {IoT devices collect privacy-sensitive data, e.g., in smart grids or in medical devices, and send this data to cloud servers for further processing. In order to ensure confidentiality as well as authenticity of the sensor data in the untrusted cloud environment, we consider a transciphering scenario between embedded IoT devices and multiple cloud servers that perform secure multi-party computation (MPC). Concretely, the IoT devices encrypt their data with a lightweight symmetric cipher and send the ciphertext to the cloud servers. To obtain the secret shares of the cleartext message for further processing, the cloud servers engage in an MPC protocol to decrypt the ciphertext in a distributed manner. This way, the plaintext is never exposed to the individual servers.As an important building block in this scenario, we propose a new, provably secure family of lightweight modes for authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD), called Eevee. The Eevee family has fully parallel decryption, making it suitable for MPC protocols for which the round complexity depends on the complexity of the function they compute. Further, our modes use the lightweight forkcipher primitive that offers fixed-length output expansion and a compact yet parallelizable internal structure.All Eevee members improve substantially over the few available state-of-the-art (SotA) MPC-friendly modes and other standard solutions. We benchmark the Eevee family on a microcontroller and in MPC. Our proposed mode Jolteon (when instantiated with ForkSkinny) provides 1.85x to 3.64x speedup in IoT-encryption time and 3x to 4.5x speedup in both MPC-decryption time and data for very short queries of 8 bytes and, 1.55x to 3.04x and 1.23x to 2.43x speedup, respectively, in MPC-decryption time and data for queries up to 500 bytes when compared against SotA MPC-friendly modes instantiated with SKINNY. We also provide two advanced modes, Umbreon and Espeon, that show a favorable performance-security trade-off with stronger security guarantees such as nonce-misuse security. Additionally, all Eevee members have full n-bit security (where n is the block size of the underlying primitive), use a single primitive and require smaller state and HW area when compared with the SotA modes under their original security settings.},

However, GNNs open up new attack surfaces for privacy attacks on graph data. In this paper, we propose Infiltrator, a privacy attack that is able to pry node-level private information based on black-box access to GNNs. Different from existing works that require prior information of the victim node, we explore the possibility of conducting the attack without any information of the victim node. Our idea is to infiltrate the graph with attacker-created nodes to befriend the victim node. More specifically, we design infiltration schemes that enable the adversary to infer the label, neighboring links, and sensitive attributes of a victim node. We evaluate Infiltrator with extensive experiments on three representative GNN models and six real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that Infiltrator can achieve an attack performance of more than 98\% in all three attacks, outperforming baseline approaches. We further evaluate the defense resistance of Infiltrator against the graph homophily defender and the differentially private model.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly expanding network characterized by a very significant number of heterogeneous devices with limited resources. Clustering is a very powerful technique used to reduce the communication load, conserve energy, aggregate data and optimize the performance of IoT systems. Designing an efficient clustering algorithm is a real challenge. Once the Cluster Heads (CHs) are elected, traditional clustering algorithms typically use a single clustering radius to group nodes to form clusters. However, this approach is potentially not optimized, as devices within a cluster may have different characteristics. In this paper, we focus on the DCOPA protocol proposed for clustering in IoT networks. Once the CHs are elected, the identical clustering radius is applied to these different elected CHs despite their differences in terms of residual energy and Distance to Base Station (DistBS). The new approach, called Unequal-DCOPA (UDCOPA), makes it possible to define for each CH its clustering radius which will be sensitive to the local criteria of energy and DistBS for the CH that is being considered. The radius is modelized as a multicriteria system. Simulation results show that our new protocol UDCOPA outperforms DCOPA in energy management and lifetime parameters of nodes and network. UDCOPA increases lifetime by 34.55\% when compared to DCOPA.},

abstract = {Gaining knowledge of a person's location in the environment without needing a specialized device raises the need for device-free indoor localization systems that could be leveraged in many applications including IoT, security, etc. Wi-Fi is one of the most widely adopted technologies for indoor location determination tasks due to its ubiquity. Existing device-free indoor localization systems rely on the utilization of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI). However, RSSI is highly sensitive to environmental noise such as multi-path interference and fading which causes degradation in the system's performance. In addition, CSI suffers a lack of standardization which necessitates the requirement for special hardware or software. In this work, we present LocFree, a deep-learning-based device-free indoor localization system that handles the challenges of RSSI and CSI by leveraging the Time of Flight (ToF) information obtained using the IEEE 802.11mc Fine Time Measurement (FTM) protocol. The FTM protocol measures the Round Trip Time (RTT) between two Wi-Fi devices which is influenced by the human-body blockage. Consequently, LocFree trains a deep classification model using the RTT data indicating the person's existence in the area. Finally, LocFree employs a smoothing stage that enables location determination with fine-grained accuracy. The evaluation of LocFree in a realistic environment demonstrates its efficacy, achieving a median localization accuracy of 1.56m.},

abstract = {Batteryless sensors accelerate the Internet of Things by making wireless sensor applications sustainable. However, their inherent and frequent power failures render batteryless devices less dependable than their battery-driven equivalents. To regain dependability for intermittent systems, energy-aware scheduling strategies are required. Evaluating and comparing such algorithms only on hardware can be tedious and time consuming. Furthermore, environmental impacts and hardware variation affect repeatability and reproducibility. Therefore, we present a high-level modeling approach based on energy flows that allows the simulation of the timely behavior of intermittent systems. In specific, we model a solar-powered batteryless sensor node and use a recorded out-door solar trace as harvest input. To show the usefulness of the approach, we compare the two different operating strategies soft-Intermittent Computing and hard-Intermittent Computing. To validate the model a harvesting power estimation algorithm is implemented on the hardware and compared with the simulation. The results show that the simulation reproduces the intermittent behavior in an appropriate way. Moreover, we find that soft-IC can be a suitable substitute for hard-IC with the benefit of simplified timekeeping during times of power failure.},

abstract = {In the ever-growing Internet of Things (IoT) landscape, smart power management algorithms combined with energy harvesting solutions are crucial to obtain self-sustainability. This paper presents an energy-aware adaptive sampling rate algorithm designed for embedded deployment in resource-constrained, battery-powered IoT devices. The algorithm, based on a finite state machine (FSM) and inspired by Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Reno's additive increase and multiplicative decrease, maximizes sensor sampling rates, ensuring power self-sustainability without risking battery depletion. Moreover, we characterized our solar cell with data acquired over 48 days and used the model created to obtain energy data from an open-source world-wide dataset.To validate our approach, we introduce the EcoTrack device, a versatile device with global navigation satellite system (GNSS) capabilities and Long-Term Evolution Machine Type Communication (LTE-M) connectivity, supporting MQTT protocol for cloud data relay. This multi-purpose device can be used, for instance, as a health and safety wearable, remote hazard monitoring system, or as a global asset tracker.The results, validated on data from three different European cities, show that the proposed algorithm enables self-sustainability while maximizing sampled locations per day. In experiments conducted with a 3000 mAh battery capacity, the algorithm consistently maintained a minimum of 24 localizations per day and achieved peaks of up to 3000.},

abstract = {The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) is boosting the proliferation of sensors and smart devices in industry and daily life. Continuous monitoring IoT systems are also finding application in agriculture, particularly in the realm of smart farming. The adoption of wearable sensors to record the activity of livestock has garnered increasing interest. Such a device enables farmers to locate, monitor, and constantly assess the health status of their cattle more efficiently and effectively, even in challenging terrain and remote locations. This work presents a maintenance-free and robust smart sensing system that is capable of tracking cattle in remote locations and collecting activity parameters, such as the individual's grazing- and resting time. To support the paradigm of smart farming, the cattle tracker is capable of monitoring the cow's activity by analyzing data from an accelerometer, magnetometer, temperature sensor, and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) module, providing them over Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) to a backend server. By consuming 511.9 J per day with all subsystems enabled and a data transmission every 15 minutes, the custom-designed sensor node achieves a battery lifetime of 4 months. When exploiting the integrated solar energy harvesting subsystem, this can be even increased by 40\% to up to 6 months. The final sensing system's robust operation is proven in a trial run with two cows on a pasture for over three days. Evaluations of the experimental results clearly show behavior patterns, which confirms the practicability of the proposed solution.},

abstract = {The escalating issue of indoor air pollution accounts for a large portion of society's economy and health. Advances in the effective integration of sensors, building controls, and infrastructure are transforming our society. Today, unparalleled research includes the acquisition, integration, and analysis of diverse data, such as sensors, devices, and buildings to tackle the major issues that cities face, like air pollution leading to unsafe or unproductive built environments. The escalating issue of indoor air pollution has garnered widespread concern due to its profound implications on public health. The extent of susceptibility and resultant effects are intricately intertwined with the economic strata of societies and individuals. Notably, the Indian population lives in some of the world's highest air pollution levels, which is no more restricted outdoors. This research specifically targets the predominant middle-income demographic within India, a segment heavily reliant on natural ventilation and generally devoid of air conditioning or purification systems. This study undertakes an assessment of indoor air quality across 54 residential households situated in diverse neighbourhoods within Kharagpur. The primary objective is to interpret the relationship between indoor pollutant concentrations and building attributes. A meticulous analysis of indoor air quality is conducted, with attention to variances between single-sided and cross-ventilated abodes. By shedding light on these critical aspects, this research endeavours to expand our comprehension of indoor air pollution and offer insights into potential measures. Enhanced indoor air quality does not only enhance occupant well-being but also catalyse economic advancement, fostering a trajectory toward a sustainable and inclusive future.},

abstract = {Modeling the performance and energy consumption of buildings is a fundamental step toward smart building development. However, it is a daunting task due to the inherent complexity of buildings with a wide range of configurations of numerous controlled systems, sensors, and actuators, as well as the interactions between them, for example, interactions between outside weather, heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) process variables, and user comfort. While existing physics-based platforms for building simulations, such as EnergyPlus or Modelica, have been successfully used for energy optimizations, manual model creation is slow and does not scale well for deployment in many buildings. The rapid growth of building data streams, on the other hand, provides an opportunity for fast and scalable data-driven model development. In this paper, we propose an automated data-driven HVAC modeling platform for building simulations, which can be used with reinforcement learning or predictive controller designs. Our proposed platform has been initially validated using the real-world data of an office building with 15 air handling units (AHUs). The validation is performed by incorporating the data-driven models into an OpenAI Gym wrapper and running a multi-step ahead assessment of the created environment under several simple rule-based control schemes.},

abstract = {As sensors pervade the built environment, they have fueled the advance of data-driven models that promise greater efficiency for microgrid management. However, this has raised concerns over data privacy and data ownership. The paradigm of federated learning has emerged in supervised learning to address these issues, but work on federated RL is relatively rare, and focuses on training global models that do not take into account the heterogeneity of data from different microgrids. We develop the first application of Personalized Federated Hypernetworks (PFH) to Reinforcement Learning (RL). We then present a novel application of PFH to few-shot transfer, and demonstrate significant initial increases in learning. PFH has never been demonstrated beyond supervised learning benchmarks, so we apply PFH to an important domain: RL price-setting for energy demand response. We consider a general case across where agents are split across multiple microgrids, wherein energy consumption data must be kept private within each microgrid. Together, our work explores how the fields of personalized federated learning and RL can come together to make learning efficient across multiple tasks while avoiding the need for centralized data storage.},

By embedding PCM with external wall, direct heat flow from the outdoor to indoor can be significantly reduced and heat stored in the PCM layers as thermal charge can be released later when outdoor temperature reduces after sunset. This study quantifies the impact of PCM in combination with EPS for better thermal performance. The simulation outcomes of this study suggest that by optimizing the structural integration of PCM and an insulation layer, passive cooling can be achieved in an air-conditioned space. By using PCM, up to 14.82\% drop in room air temperature and 62\% drop in room's sensible heat can be achieved during summer months. These outcomes present an opportunity to improve the building energy efficiency by encouraging the promotion of passive and environmentally-aware construction practices.},

abstract = {The wireless sensor network (WSN) has been gaining popularity for automation and performance improvement in different IoT-based applications. The resource-constrained nature and operating environment of IoT make the devices highly vulnerable to different attacks. However, the Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) helps to implement secure and lightweight authentication protocols for IoT. In this context, few computation-intensive authentication protocols are found in the literature that have addressed secure IoT communication in WSN. Besides, these protocols depend on the local storage of PUF-CRP, which is susceptible to security attacks. This work proposes a lightweight and secure authentication protocol for the IoT devices in WSN. A PUF and its machine learning (ML)–based soft model is integrated to ensure secure authentication and lightweight computation in WSN. PUF prevents physical attacks while carrying much less hardware fingerprints, and the ML-based PUF provides the desired resiliency against PUF identity-based attacks by eliminating the requirement of CRP-based storage. The proposed mechanism delivers two-way authentication while nullifying the attacks on IoT. The proposed protocol is implemented on Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA and Raspberry Pi for testability and performance evaluation. Experiment results and analysis signify its low-cost computations and lightweight features desired for IoT.},

abstract = {Road attributes play a pivotal role in digital maps, providing critical information for various routing and planning applications that aim to create a safe and efficient traffic environment. While some road attributes are available in existing map data such as OpenStreetMap [3], these sources may not cover all regions, meet high-quality standards, or include specific attributes required for specialized applications using these. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that leverages multi-task deep learning to learn road attributes from remote sensing imagery and GPS data. Our approach treats the task as a multi-task learning problem and incorporates convolutional and graph neural networks into an end-to-end learning framework. This enables efficient prediction of multiple road attributes for a set of input roads. To evaluate our system, we collect annotations and develop our model using public map sources. Our results demonstrate promising performance in predicting road type, road median, lane number, road directionality, and width in meters. By exploring different road attributes compared to previous works, our efforts open up new possibilities for novel applications in this domain. Overall, our research contributes to advancing the understanding and prediction of road attributes, enhancing the quality and completeness of digital maps, and enabling the development of innovative solutions for various applications.},

Research results from the implementation of this curriculum will be presented to demonstrate the nature of teachers’ experiences with the curriculum.Participants. Participants are teachers implementing the new curriculum at two schools in the metro Atlanta area.Study Method. This paper is partly descriptive, presenting the theory underlying the newly developed curriculum as well as its various features. An organizing framework, the Teacher Accessibility, Equity, and Content (TEC) rubric from Weintrop et al. (2019) [1], is used to structure the curriculum description. Teacher perceptions were gathered via both structured interviews and short online enactment surveys. These perceptions are summarized and presented thematically, corresponding to the features of the curriculum.Findings. A newly developed introductory computer science (CS) curriculum, Student-Centered Computing (SCC), utilizes project-based learning (PBL) and culturally authentic practices (CAPs) to help promote a sense of belonging and intent to persist within computer science among all students. Teachers successfully implemented the curriculum and generally found it to be beneficial for their students, though they struggled with some of the pedagogical demands of project-based learning as well as some of the most advanced technical content associated with the music coding and app development platforms.Conclusions. This paper provides a detailed overview of a year-long introductory computer science curriculum focused on the creation of culturally relevant digital artifacts. The curriculum represents a strong effort to make CS content relevant and appealing to the full range of students by relating it to their lives and experiences. Teacher surveys and interviews revealed that both teachers and students had positive views of the course. However, teaching using inclusive PBL pedagogy and culturally authentic practices takes skill and practice by teachers, supporting the need for CS teachers to have good pedagogical training as well as a strong knowledge of computer science to create a classroom environment that promotes success for all students.},

abstract = {In the Internet of Things, the physical world itself becomes an information system. Sensors and micro devices are embedded in objects. They are connected to the Internet through wired or wireless networks using the same network protocols. The IoT(Internet of Things) can monitor stress, temperature, pressure, image and other parameters of the surrounding environment through sensors. With the maturity of sensor technology, wireless sensor network, as the most promising technology, has many applications, including data acquisition and event detection. This paper proposes an improved design strategy based on the optimized particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the shortest path routing problem in wireless sensor networks. In this paper, MATLAB is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol. It is found that compared with LEACH(Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) protocol, the protocol reduces packet loss by about 25\%. The simulation results show that the IPSO(Improved Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm can improve the network coverage by 15.21\%, while only 10 nodes need to be added to improve connectivity, and the network performance has been significantly improved.},

abstract = {The magnitude of data in the sensor is increasing, so how to deal with data fusion technology has become the current research direction. Aiming at the problems of high attribute dimensions and the number of big data objects, it is necessary to study an efficient information fusion algorithm, which can better estimate and understand the surrounding environment and the development trend of things, so as to provide better decision support. In this paper, the feature fusion method of IoT(Internet of things) high attribute dimension data based on partition idea is studied. In order to improve the computational efficiency of feature fusion of high-dimensional IoT data, we present an efficient algorithm. This algorithm is based on the idea of partitioning, which cuts the high attribute dimension data into a number of relatively low attribute dimension data. First, these relatively low attribute dimension data are processed, and then the necessary feature attributes of the original high attribute dimension data are calculated by using these processing results, so as to ensure that the results obtained are the same as those obtained by directly calculating the high attribute dimension data. The research shows that the efficiency of the proposed algorithm is 9.362\% higher than that of the traditional algorithm, which shows that the proposed algorithm is superior to the common data fusion algorithm.},

abstract = {Data imputation is prevalent in crowdsensing, especially for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. On the one hand, data collected from sensors will inevitably be affected or damaged by unpredictability. On the other hand, extending the active time of sensor networks has urgently aspired environmental monitoring. Using neural networks to design a data imputation algorithm can take advantage of the prior information stored in the models. This paper proposes a preprocessing algorithm to extract a subset for training a neural network on an IoT dataset, including time window determination, sensor aggregation, sensor exclusion and data frame shape selection. Moreover, we propose a data imputation algorithm using deep compressed sensing with generative models. It explores novel representation matrices and can impute data in the case of a high missing ratio situation. Finally, we test our subset extraction algorithm and data imputation algorithm on the EPFL SensorScope dataset, respectively, and they effectively improve the accuracy and robustness even with extreme data loss.},

abstract = {Autonomous navigation and formation control of multi-UAV systems pose a significant challenge for the robotic systems that operate in partially observable, dynamic and continuous environments. This paper addresses the problem of multi-UAV cooperative sensing and coverage of a flood-struck region to identify serviceable paths to critical locations for waterborne vehicles (WBV) in real time. A serviceable path is defined as a location that is obstacle free and has adequate water level for possible movement of WBVs. We develop a deep reinforcement learning model to learn a cooperative multi-UAV policy for real-time coverage of a flooded region. The coverage information gathered by the UAVs captures the presence of obstacles present in the path connecting the start and target/critical locations given by the shortest Manhattan distance. This coverage information is utilized by the path planning algorithm, i.e., MEA*, to minimize the number of expansion nodes and identify a serviceable path quickly. To conserve energy, UAVs initially follow a guided path to explore the optimal route. If obstacles are encountered, the UAVs search nearby areas for an alternate path to reach the critical location(s). The proposed approach, MEA* MADDPG, is compared with other prevalent techniques from the literature over real-world inspired simulated flood environments. The results highlight the significance of the proposed model as it outperforms other techniques when compared over various performance metrics.},

abstract = {The present work reports a flexible and stretchable wearable sensing system based on a piezoresistive method inspired by human skin mechanoreceptors and strain gauges. The tactile sensor consists of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as a flexible and stretchable body and liquid metal Eutectic Gallium Indium (EGaIn) as the sensing material. Microchannel fabrication on a PDMS elastomer is an essential step, and we are achieving this by preparing the mold of stainless steel using mechanical micromachining and casting out the PDMS. Microchannel fabrication using a micromachining facility on stretchable and flexible material is a green and economical alternative to commonly known chemical itch and photolithography techniques. In addition, it has advantages over 3D printing techniques in terms of the size limitation fabricating the smallest feature and surface finish. This work focuses on fabricating microchannels using a multipurpose micromachining setup, which can prepare microchannel patterns of different shapes like serpentine and coil and sizes such as 200x200μm2 cross-section. The overall size of the sensor is just 15mm x15mm x1mm with a sensing area of 10mm x 10 mm, which is suitable to wear on human fingers. With this pattern, we have cast out the outer layer of elastomer for the development of the sensor. A strain sensor design has been developed to fabricate these sensors to sense directional forces and bending. Most importantly, creating microchannels on the PDMS is the point of focus where a micromachining facility is being used. Up to 25\% strain, we have achieved a gauge factor of 0.98. It has many applications, such as healthcare, human motion detection, virtual reality gaming, human-robot interaction, etc.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the design and development of a robot for use in environments that require interactive actions and decision-making, such as assistance in hospitals, airports, and hotel lobbies - the 'Shopping Assistance Robot’ or SAR. The core SAR unit consists of a mobile base platform that has sensors for safe navigation in a complex environment along with a humanoid-inspired superstructure designed for friendly interactions with human agents, with in-built electronics, sensor control units, and an arm for manipulation actions such as grasping and pick-and-place tasks. The SAR is then proposed to work in tandem with in-store cameras, integrated with a server, which provide cues to the SAR regarding ‘customers of interest’ and potential coordinates to target locations and navigation guidance. We also describe the design aspects of SAR and provide an analysis of the design of SAR in terms of structural integrity, human-robot interaction comfort, and cost. Finally, we discuss the results obtained from design analysis and describe the final fabrication and assembly of SAR with demonstrations of some of its basic capabilities in a test arena facility built at our laboratory. Subsequent trials demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed robot and help us identify key bottlenecks and directions for further work.},
