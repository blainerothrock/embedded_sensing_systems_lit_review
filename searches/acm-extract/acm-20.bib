abstract = {Although quantum computing has been attracting increasing attention, hardware restrictions are tight in current implementations. Intensive design exploration is therefore essential to match requirements, such as the problem scale and acceptable error rate, with potential designs to combine quantum computing and classical computing. The design decision made in this way is often fragile as it is sensitive to the problem scale as well as still evolving quantum services. We need continuous design decision, or adaptation and evolution, given changes in requirements or environments. In this paper, we present a framework for model-based engineering to support the continuous adaptation and evolution of quantum-classical hybrid systems. Modeling in our framework involves not only potential designs, but also rationale or evidence of design decision, which often requires simulation and experiments. This focus allows for tracing and analyzing whether the past decision is still valid or not, or whether there is uncertainty and we need further simulation and experiments. The usage of the framework is demonstrated with an example problem from steel manufacturing.},

abstract = {Breakthroughs in Wireless Energy Transfer technologies have revitalized Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks. However, how to schedule mobile chargers rationally has been quite a tricky problem. Most of the current work does not consider the variability of scenarios and how many mobile chargers should be scheduled as the most appropriate for each dispatch. At the same time, the focus of most work on the mobile charger scheduling problem has always been on reducing the number of dead nodes, and the most critical metric of network performance, packet arrival rate, is relatively neglected. In this article, we develop a DRL-based Partial Charging algorithm. Based on the number and urgency of charging requests, we classify charging requests into four scenarios. And for each scenario, we design a corresponding request allocation algorithm. Then, a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm is employed to train a decision model using environmental information to select which request allocation algorithm is optimal for the current scenario. After the allocation of charging requests is confirmed, to improve the Quality of Service, i.e., the packet arrival rate of the entire network, a partial charging scheduling algorithm is designed to maximize the total charging duration of nodes in the ideal state while ensuring that all charging requests are completed. In addition, we analyze the traffic information of the nodes and use the Analytic Hierarchy Process to determine the importance of the nodes to compensate for the inaccurate estimation of the node’s remaining lifetime in realistic scenarios. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms regarding the number of alive nodes and packet arrival rate.},

abstract = {Agricultural irrigation is a significant contributor to freshwater consumption. However, the current irrigation systems used in the field are not efficient. They rely mainly on soil moisture sensors and the experience of growers but do not account for future soil moisture loss. Predicting soil moisture loss is challenging because it is influenced by numerous factors, including soil texture, weather conditions, and plant characteristics. This article proposes a solution to improve irrigation efficiency, which is called DRLIC (deep reinforcement learning for irrigation control). DRLIC is a sophisticated irrigation system that uses deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize its performance. The system employs a neural network, known as the DRL control agent, which learns an optimal control policy that considers both the current soil moisture measurement and the future soil moisture loss. We introduce an irrigation reward function that enables our control agent to learn from previous experiences. However, there may be instances in which the output of our DRL control agent is unsafe, such as irrigating too much or too little. To avoid damaging the health of the plants, we implement a safety mechanism that employs a soil moisture predictor to estimate the performance of each action. If the predicted outcome is deemed unsafe, we perform a relatively conservative action instead. To demonstrate the real-world application of our approach, we develop an irrigation system that comprises sprinklers, sensing and control nodes, and a wireless network. We evaluate the performance of DRLIC by deploying it in a testbed consisting of six almond trees. During a 15-day in-field experiment, we compare the water consumption of DRLIC with a widely used irrigation scheme. Our results indicate that DRLIC outperforms the traditional irrigation method by achieving water savings of up to 9.52\%.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate student experiences when using the Pytch programming environment. Pytch is a novel system we are developing to ease the transition from block-based to text-based programming through the preservation of the Scratch-style programming model within a Python programming environment. This paper adds to the literature on the problematic transition from block to text programming by describing and analysing the impact on learners of a platform that is focused specifically on the question of this transition. In the in-person workshops described in this paper, students were introduced to the Pytch platform in a classroom environment. Data were collected from a variety of sources to evaluate the effect of Pytch on students, including pre and post surveys, in-class observations, and focus group data. We found high user satisfaction and engagement with Pytch. We also found an increase in user confidence at programming tasks, with a stronger effect for less-experienced participants. These results indicate the usefulness of Pytch in fostering enthusiasm and a sense of achievement, particularly for intermediate and introductory learners in the context of text-based programming. Evaluation of the qualitative data collected during sessions provided valuable insights as to how Pytch supported learners, and what future refinements to the system would be beneficial.},

abstract = {Although software testing is key to a safe society, the process itself is often perceived by students as boring and stressful. Therefore, only few consider a career in testing. The adverse effect is sub-optimally tested code, with dangerous bugs left undetected. A better understanding of what testers "feel" when learning the skill in class can remedy this situation, by means of personalized, motivating bio-feedback. In order to test our hypothesis, we propose an innovative approach that uses physiological wearable sensors (cardiac activity, respiration, and skin conductance) to monitor in real-time the affective state of testers engaged in a bug-hunting game. This is a work in progress. We present the envisioned methodology and the results of two feasibility experiments. The first experiment created a training dataset, by recording bio-signals and self-reports from eleven participants involved in a mood-induction session followed by a bug-hunting task. The second experiment showed that it is possible to use deep-learning to recognize emotions from a large set of labelled multimodal (ECG, EDA and ICG) physiological data. The classification accuracy using a binary (positive-negative) emotions model was 85\%, higher than the accuracy obtained using a four-emotions (anxious, down, enthusiastic and relaxed) model (57\%). Future work includes optimizing the sensory system, improving the accuracy of automated emotions recognition, increasing the validity of ground-truth emotions labelling, and investigating ways to provide individualized and formative (instead of summative) bio-feedback. The proposed approach can contribute to a more sentiment-aware education, and a more objective evaluation of the effect of teaching interventions.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence-driven Development Environments (AIDEs) offer developers revolutionary computer programming assistance. There is great potential in incorporating AIDEs into Computer Science education; however, the effects of these tools should be fully examined before doing so. Here, a within-subjects study was conducted to compare the programming performance, workload, emotion, and self-efficacy of seventeen novices coding with and without use of the GitHub Copilot AIDE under time pressure. Results showed that using the AIDE significantly increased programming efficiency and reduced effort and mental workload but did not significantly impact emotion or self-efficacy. However, participants' performance improved with more experience using the AI, and their self-efficacy followed. The results suggest that students who try AIDEs will likely be tempted to use them for time-sensitive work. There is no evidence that providing AIDEs will aid struggling students, but there is a clear need for students to practice with AI to become competent and confident using it.},

Human Activity Recognition has emerged as a popular use case for smartwatches, enabling the recognition of activities starting from internal sensors. Data acquisition from sensors is crucial in wearable devices because if not properly implemented can reduce battery life or device responsiveness. The paper presents an energy-efficient programming library for real-time sensor sampling on smartwatches using native Wear OS sensor APIs. The library’s implementation is evaluated on a real smartwatch for code size, memory utilization, and power consumption.

abstract = {Despite of their benefits, existing Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) or enclaves have been criticized for lack of transparency, vulnerabilities, and various restrictions. A significant limitation is that they only provide a static and fixed hardware Trusted Computing Base (TCB) that cannot be customized for different applications. The design violates the principle of least privilege by including unnecessary peripherals in the hardware TCB and buggy peripheral drivers in the software TCB. Additionally, Existing TEEs time-share a processor core with the Rich Execution Environment (REE), making execution less efficient and vulnerable to cache side-channel attacks. Although many previous projects have focused on addressing software issues in TEEs on SGX, TrustZone, or RISC-V, some TEE issues are inherent in the hardware system's design, making them impossible to resolve with software alone.In this paper, we present BYOTee (Build Your Own Trusted Execution Environments), which is an easy-to-use hardware and software co-design infrastructure for building enclaves using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). BYOTee creates enclaves with customized hardware TCBs and establishes a dynamic root of trust that allows untampered execution of Security-Sensitive Applications (SSA) from preexisting software on the hardcore system. Additionally, BYOTee provides mechanisms to attest the integrity of enclaves' hardware and software stacks. We implement a BYOTee system for the Xilinx System-on-Chip (SoC) FPGA. The evaluations on the low-end Zynq-7000 system for four SSAs and 12 benchmark applications demonstrate the usage, security, effectiveness, and performance of the BYOTee framework.},

However, how can we support care systems designers to apply these concepts in practice? This paper presents the Care Spectrums, a set of sensitising concepts for designers to explore and apply to their practice. Developed as a response to a design probe exercise (the CareTree) which was carried out with 14 participants over one month, the Care Spectrums respond to the multiplicity of expressions of care in participants’ everyday lives. Translated into a design resource (the ‘Co-Designing with Care’ card deck), and trialled with 10 designers, the Care Spectrums revealed hidden caring and uncaring practices in designers’ projects, and stimulated opportunities for designing with and for people's complex and entangled care ecologies.},

Our findings support and extend design openings for the development of “pacing technologies”. These include the importance of customization and supporting the user in their recovery if appropriate, applying strategies for mitigating anxiety when tracking, facilitating the sharing of pacing data with friends and family and healthcare providers, and supporting users in identifying the optimal components of rest.},

abstract = {Popular consumer Internet of Things (IoT) devices provide increasingly diverse sensing and actuation capabilities. Despite their benefits, such devices prompt numerous security concerns. Typically, security is attained at device-level granularity, which relies upon device trustworthiness. However, if a device is compromised (e.g., via remote exploits), this approach fails. To this end, we construct SA4P: Sensing and Actuation as a Privilege, a framework that decouples IoT devices from their physical environment. In SA4P, whenever any software on a device wants to access a sensing or actuation peripheral, it must be authorized to do so. This is achieved by the inclusion of an on-board component, Peripheral Guard (PEG), that physically guards peripherals. Besides providing strong security guarantees, SA4P motivates developers to consider sensing and actuation as valuable resources. SA4P' design is modular, lightweight, and formally verified. It also does not require any hardware modifications for trusted execution environment (TEE)-equipped devices, while imposing only modest changes for other devices.},

abstract = {The adoption of wearable technologies, such as smartwatches or wristbands, is rising. End-users expect to use all of their devices in an interconnected and seamless manner to conduct digital transactions, e.g., to pay or identify via their smartwatches, and not only via their smartphones. As sensitive transactions are usually protected by hardware-enforced isolation mechanisms, such as Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), this brings new challenges of interconnecting TEEs to collaboratively conduct such transactions. We therefore propose MultiTEE, a distributed TEE architecture for heterogeneous device clusters, enabling secure data exchange and cooperation between TEEs. MultiTEE relies on lightweight, secure channels between TEEs, combined with remote attestation for the integrity verification of software stacks, as well as a memory-safe implementation. This enables an interface between Trusted Applications (TAs) of the distributed TEE similar to the interfaces of classic, single device TEEs. To demonstrate the feasibility of our solution, we built a Proof of Concept (PoC), partially implementing the upcoming European Digital Identity (EUDI) wallet to show the usage of heterogeneous device clusters for electronic identification. We evaluate our solution regarding performance and security.},

We describe the development of The Life of a Small Town, a portable knitting machine that was adapted to knit rows of stitches in response to sensor data. The machine travelled throughout a small town and "popped up" at local art events to sense and physicalize social gatherings held by an arts organization over the period of one year. Individuals participating in events could also decorate their own "stitch markers" to annotate and pin to the data.

abstract = {Large pre-trained models, also known as foundation models (FMs), are trained in a task-agnostic manner on large-scale data and can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks by fine-tuning, few-shot, or even zero-shot learning. Despite their successes in language and vision tasks, we have not yet seen an attempt to develop foundation models for geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI). In this work, we explore the promises and challenges of developing multimodal foundation models for GeoAI. We first investigate the potential of many existing FMs by testing their performances on seven tasks across multiple geospatial domains, including Geospatial Semantics, Health Geography, Urban Geography, and Remote Sensing. Our results indicate that on several geospatial tasks that only involve text modality, such as toponym recognition, location description recognition, and US state-level/county-level dementia time series forecasting, the task-agnostic large learning models (LLMs) can outperform task-specific fully supervised models in a zero-shot or few-shot learning setting. However, on other geospatial tasks, especially tasks that involve multiple data modalities (e.g., POI-based urban function classification, street view image–based urban noise intensity classification, and remote sensing image scene classification), existing FMs still underperform task-specific models. Based on these observations, we propose that one of the major challenges of developing an FM for GeoAI is to address the multimodal nature of geospatial tasks. After discussing the distinct challenges of each geospatial data modality, we suggest the possibility of a multimodal FM that can reason over various types of geospatial data through geospatial alignments. We conclude this article by discussing the unique risks and challenges to developing such a model for GeoAI.},

abstract = {Metaverse platforms have been on the rise in recent years, offering three-dimensional (3D), immersive virtual worlds while encouraging user-generated content (UGC) in various forms. Roblox, a popular metaverse platform, enables its users to create a holistic virtual world (i.e., develop a 3D game) for other users to interact with. However, complex UGC is also challenging to moderate. Roblox has been notorious for its users’ harmful designs, such as Nazi or terrorist role-playing mechanisms. In this study, we explore how harmful design takes place on Roblox. Through a grounded theory analysis of the ‘r/Robloxgamedev’ subreddit, we conceptualize an ecological view of harmful design, foregrounding three interconnected circumstances, namely sociotechnical risks, socioeconomic precarities, and normative (in)sensitivities, which work together to condition and give rise to harmful designs and bring about unique governance challenges to metaverse platforms. We conclude by laying out implications for design moderation.},

abstract = {Providing timely support and intervention is crucial in mental health settings. As the need to engage youth comfortable with texting increases, mental health providers are exploring and adopting text-based media such as chatbots, community-based forums, online therapies with licensed professionals, and helplines operated by trained responders. To support these text-based media for mental health–particularly for crisis care–we are developing a system to perform passive emotion-sensing using a combination of keystroke dynamics and sentiment analysis. Our early studies of this system posit that the analysis of short text messages and keyboard typing patterns can provide emotion information that may be used to support both clients and responders. We use our preliminary findings to discuss the way forward for applying AI to support mental health providers in providing better care.},

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are new systems designed to support and synthesize sensing, communication, and computing components that interact with physical objects so that the system can sense, monitor, control, and respond to changes occurring in their operating environments. With developing Internet of Things (IoT), edge/cloud computing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), another new paradigm - Digital Twin (DT), as an enabler for realizing the Metaverse of CPS has emerged recently. The DT provides a virtual replica of the physical world, allowing for real-time monitoring, control, and analysis of safety-critical systems like the CPS. Even though many CPS-related problems can be addressed using DT concepts, it is critical to define DT’s integration clearly to leverage its features to the best possible extent. This paper introduces a new layer called the data layer in the CPS layer architecture to support different DT functionalities. Like the layer and abstract design paradigm of modern operation systems and computer networks, the data layer serves as an abstraction layer, providing immense flexibility and interchangeability of various data sources, supporting applications, and adapting to other components and environments. This also accelerates the growth of smart-world systems and their integration in different application domains (smart grid, smart transportation, smart manufacturing, smart cities, smart healthcare, etc.). To this end, this paper presents a new data layer structure to support CPS applications and the integration of multiple CPS. We propose a hierarchical architecture to synthesize DT techniques as an independent layer in our architecture, deeply integrated into existing CPS. We discuss key issues: leveraging the data layer to support applications in various CPS, incorporating the data layer and physical layer, and building a data layer using distributed computing, naming services, etc. Finally, the paper outlines future research directions based on the presented new data layer architecture for CPS.},

In particular, real-time optimization and testing are related to enormous effort and risk. A holistic, flexibly configurable, real-time capable test bench for the entire vehicle is the remedy for this situation. This test system must replicate both the road excitation and the networked traffic environment with sufficient accuracy. In addition, the sensory perceptions of the vehicle must be stimulated.

abstract = {Research on wearable devices and sensors applied to older adults has witnessed significant growth, primarily focusing on health monitoring but also on researching real-world applications of urban walking, specifically, walkability. The use of pedestrians’ bodily responses to the environment, known as the people-centric sensing strategy, has been demonstrated to be more suitable for detecting challenging environmental conditions and enhancing walkability. However, the extent to which such data may accurately pinpoint environmental distress in a particular demographic, such as older adults, has not been thoroughly investigated. The purpose of this in-progress systematic review of the literature is to outline the strategy employed and highlight some preliminary findings on the use of wearable sensors or sensor-based technologies in gathering the bodily responses of older adults and/or their family caregivers to stimuli originating from real urban walking scenarios. Our preliminary findings showed that the current research on using wearable devices to detect bodily responses in older adults (or informal caregivers) population in relation to walkability in outdoor environments tends to exhibit a uniform strategy, that is, collecting physiological and location data from older adults through controlled outdoor walking routes using wrist-wearable and GPS; training supervised classifiers to differentiate between physiological stress and non-stress signals to environmental conditions of external interaction; and finally, using hotspot analysis to group together individual physiological responses in areas with high-stress interactions with the external environment using GIS. Although the body of literature appears to be still in its early stages, using wearable sensors and a GIS-based approach could be a promising method for spatio-temporally capturing people’s direct bodily responses to the environmental stressors, and this offer rooms for potential integration of simulation-based models into Digital Twins environments with GIS-based analysis to further enhance our understanding of older adults mobility in urban settings. However, our preliminary findings indicates a gap in the research regarding the detection of bodily responses to stimuli on outdoor walking paths using wearable sensors, specifically among informal carers.},

abstract = {Video situation monitoring is essential for various applications such as surveillance and monitoring and societal applications (e.g., senior care or Assisted Living (AL) monitoring). Quality of life can be significantly improved in AL environments if various situations (e.g., monitoring community engagement, inactivity for a long time, etc.) can be analyzed automatically. These situations are currently monitored using manual analysis or custom solutions. The manual analysis process uses human-in-the-loop to watch videos exhaustively, and it is not practical and scalable for videos with long duration. On the other hand, custom solutions require each situation to be predefined and typically use sensors, machine learning algorithms, Internet of Things devices, and others. A new algorithm or device must be developed for each situation type. This paper proposes an alternative approach for automated situation monitoring by posing situations as queries. The proposed Querying Video Contents framework avoids or minimizes human-in-the-loop and can eventually support ‘real-time’ analysis. QVC framework extracts video contents once and allows ‘ad-hoc’ queries to be specified as needed and processed. Two alternative representation models (extended relational and graphs) are supported. Primitive operators and algorithms are developed for both models to analyze various situations. This paper discusses only the graph model of the QVC framework. Alternative graph models for representing extracted video contents, their properties for video situation analysis, and primitive algorithms for analyzing extracted contents for situation analysis are proposed in this paper. Additionally, the proposed approach identifies several situations related to the AL domain and approaches to their analysis using the proposed algorithms. The experimental results discuss the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of the proposed approach for analyzing these situations.},

abstract = {The privacy of personal data is paramount in the realm of assisted living and digital healthcare. Federated Learning (FL), with its decentralised model training approach, has emerged as a compelling solution to reconcile the need for personalised models with the requirement to protect sensitive personal information. By allowing model training to occur locally on user devices without centralising raw data, FL is intended to strike a balance between personalisation and privacy. While the potential benefits of FL in assisted living and digital healthcare are substantial, practical implementation poses significant challenges. One of them is the non-Independently and Identically Distributed (non-IID) nature of personal data. Unlike centralised datasets, non-IID data exhibits inherent variability across different individuals, as well as their surrounding contexts. Unfortunately, many research approaches in this domain often overlook the nuances of non-IID data, potentially leading to models that lack robust generalisation across diverse healthcare scenarios. To highlight the importance of this challenge, in this paper, we report on our hands-on experience of building a FL system for drowsiness detection using non-IID data. We compare this federated setup with a traditional, centralised approach to model training by identifying and discussing the associated challenges from multiple perspectives, as well as possible solutions and recommendations for further research.},

In this study wearable devices and artificial intelligence methods are combined to identify tooth brushing. The focus is on utilizing convolutional neural networks to recognize brushing gestures based on short samples of accelerometer data collected from wrist-worn devices. As a benchmarking dataset, we train and test the model with a public database containing signals obtained from a wide set of experimental subjects performing a variety of different manual actions. The results show the high effectiveness of the detector, which achieves quality metrics (sensitivity and specificity) higher than 95\% when it is employed to discriminate brushing actions from other 23 hand movements. This performance is improved if the architecture is refined through a simple low-pass filtering of the classifier's decisions, aimed at correcting the classification of anomalous and isolated mobility patterns.},

While promising to sense and track infants’ well-being, interaction with these devices rarely accommodates parental empathy in its various embodied aspects. This position paper addresses this gap by focusing on their sounds. While baby monitors typically consist of symbolic and abstract cues, embodied sound practices may better attend to the empathic nature of parental care. By juxtaposing empathic phenomena with current interactive sound practices, we highlight two possible design research directions: embodied alerts and empathic sonification. Through their discussion, we wish to contribute to the critical discourse on parenting technologies and the caring ecologies within which they exist, and inspire audible experiments that resonate with the uniquely empathic relationships between parents and their infants.},

abstract = {Currently, waste management is one of the most critical issues in Thailand and globally due to the continuous increase in waste volume and improper waste management practices. According to statistics from the Department of Pollution Control, Thailand's waste volume has been increasing annually. As of the latest data in the year 2022, Thailand's total waste volume reached 25.70 million tons per year. This substantial amount of waste can have various adverse effects on the environment, leading to issues such as disease transmission and pollution. To address this problem, there has been ongoing development of technology for waste management and sorting. This presents an intriguing alternative for tackling waste management challenges. If waste can be managed properly and efficiently, it can have positive economic impacts and contribute to environmental development. Recognizing the significance and benefits of waste segregation and proper management, a system for waste detection and sorting based on image recognition and embedded artificial intelligence has been proposed. The system processes images to identify and classify waste, providing notifications regarding the type of waste detected. The model has been trained using deep learning technology, convolutional neural networks, and computer vision-based artificial intelligence. It is operationalized with a prototype robotic platform utilizing highperformance microcontroller boards for processing. The model has been trained with datasets of various types of waste, enabling it to accurately detect and recognize hazardous waste through sensors and robotic platforms. This system has demonstrated superior performance in waste detection and recognition and can operate effectively in diverse real-world environments. Therefore, the waste detection and sorting system based on image recognition and embedded artificial intelligence can help mitigate the risks associated with waste inspection and promote proper and efficient waste management.},

abstract = {The increased adoption of additive manufacturing (AM) and the acceptance of AM outsourcing created an ecosystem in which the sending and receiving of digital designs by different actors became normal. It has recently been shown that the STL design files---most commonly used in AM---contain steganographic channels. Such channels can allow additional data to be embedded within the STL files without changing the printed model. These factors create a threat of misusing the design files as a covert communication channel to either exfiltrate stolen sensitive digital data from organizations or infiltrate malicious software into a secure environment. This paper addresses this security threat by designing and evaluating a sanitizer that erases hidden content where steganographic channels might exist. The proposed sanitizer takes into account a set of specific constraints imposed by the application domain, such as not affecting the ability to manufacture part of the required quality using the sanitized design.},

abstract = {In today's digital landscape, the ubiquity of mobile devices underscores the urgent need for stringent security protocols in both data transmission and storage. Plausibly deniable encryption (PDE) stands out as a pivotal solution, particularly in jurisdictions marked by rigorous regulations or increased vulnerabilities of personal data. However, the existing PDE systems for mobile platforms have evident limitations. These include vulnerabilities to multi-snapshot attacks over RAM and flash memory, an undue dependence on non-secure operating systems, traceable PDE entry point, and a conspicuous PDE application prone to reverse engineering.  To address these limitations, we have introduced FSPDE, the first Full-Stack mobile PDE system design which can mitigate PDE compromises present at both the execution and the storage layers of mobile stack as well as the cross-layer communication. Utilizing the resilient security features of ARM TrustZone and collaborating multiple storage sub-layers (block device, flash translation layer, etc.), FSPDE offers a suite of improvements. At the heart of our design, the MUTE and MIST protocols serve both as fortifications against emerging threats and as tools to mask sensitive data, including the PDE access point. A real-world prototype of FSPDE was developed using OP-TEE, a leading open-source Trusted Execution Environment, in tandem with an open-sourced NAND flash controller. Security analysis and experimental evaluations justify both the security and the practicality of our design.

When the device is turned on, there may be a certain time deviation which directly affects the subsequent observation accuracy. Researchers collected and analyzed observation data from two batches of Cosmic Watch, and after preprocessing and denoising the data, it was found that there were systematic time differences between different devices. To address this issue, the paper studied and compared various time correction methods. After evaluating the effectiveness and feasibility of different methods, the paper proposes an improved boot time error correction method. This method fully utilizes known signals that repeatedly appear in observations and trains a model to correct time differences through optimization algorithms. This study provides an effective time calibration method for time-sensitive astronomical observations using wearable devices such as Cosmic Watch.},

abstract = {Metaphors enrich language by allowing us to express complex ideas through familiar concepts, enhancing both understanding and creativity in communication. Crossmodal metaphors are metaphors where one sensory modality is understood in terms of another (e.g, a sharp smell). Crossmodality is an integral part of how we make sense of and create meaning about the world. However, there is a lack of research on how children generate crossmodal metaphors and the interpretation of such metaphors. We present Sense-O-Nary, a game we designed to explore how children react when asked to create crossmodal metaphors in a novel environment. Children are presented with one sensory input and then asked to describe it using a different sense, for another team to guess what the original sensory input is. We engaged children (n=65, aged 8-10) to play this crossmodal metaphor generation game. We qualitatively analysed children’s exchange of crossmodal metaphors to define a set of crossmodal association strategies and then use this to categorise the metaphors they created. We discuss how engaging with crossmodal metaphors can enhance children’s linguistic development and how our findings can inform the design of interactions that involve multiple senses.},

Field Programmable Gate Array(FPGA) with their own advantages of high integration and flexibility, are widely used in aerospace systems.However, the space environment is complex, and based on the physical structure of SRAM-type FPGA, the vast majority of FPGA devices will be very sensitive to electromagnetic radiation, which can cause errors in the configuration information of the design circuit, and even cause the system to fail to operate normally, causing incalculable damage. Therefore, it is important to study the configuration refresh technology of FPGA for starboard systems. This paper proposes a Xilinx Kintex-7 series FPGA as the target device, improves the traditional three-mode redundancy technology, and introduces a configuration refresh technology for the on-board memory control system, which corrects the data transmission error caused by SEU.

abstract = {Nowadays, aircraft positioning is mainly based on GNSS, but GNSS signal receiving equipment is difficult to ensure the stability and reliability of the positioning signal in the presence of obstruction or strong electromagnetic interference environments. In recent years, with the development of image matching technology, intelligent positioning technology for aircraft based on remote sensing image feature matching has received widespread attention. This article conducts research on the problem of aircraft positioning based on aerial photography and remote sensing image matching. Firstly, in order to solve the problem of significant differences in style between remote sensing images and aerial images, resulting in poor direct matching results, the CycleGAN style transfer network was used as the basis to study the style transfer of remote sensing images and reduce the differences between different modal images; Secondly, based on the LoFTR matching algorithm, the matching between remote sensing images and aerial images after style transfer was studied; Finally, in order to solve the problem of aircraft positioning based on image matching, the application of homography transformation in remote sensing and aerial image matching mapping was studied, and a method for calculating geographic location after successful image matching was provided. Finally, the method proposed in this paper was validated through experiments.},

abstract = {The publishing of real-time data streams with differential privacy is one of the current research hotspots in the field of privacy protection. The existing data stream publishing mainly revolves around count publishing, while user vital signs data collected under wearable devices often need to be released using mean and variance values. For the release of variance value, this paper proposes a differentially private variance value release method based on Kalman filtering and adaptive sampling under wearable devices. This method combines Kalman filtering and adaptive sampling technology to dynamically allocate a privacy budget according to the fluctuation characteristics of the data stream. By introducing the global sensitivity of the variance value that adapts to the data fluctuation characteristics of wearable devices, it reduces the amount of added noise and improves the accuracy of published data. Experimental results show that compared with the filtering and adaptive sampling (FAST) algorithm for differential privacy time series monitoring, the algorithm proposed in this paper has higher availability of published data under the condition of meeting the same privacy budget.},

abstract = {In the midst of the widespread adoption of technology, particularly among younger generations, the increasing prevalence of hate speech online has become a pressing global concern. This research paper aims to address this urgent issue by conducting a thorough investigation into hate speech detection in Hindi-English code-mixed data. Existing research has largely approached hate speech recognition as a text classification problem, focusing on predicting the class of a message based solely on its textual content. Our task, however, delves into the classification of hateful content disseminated through tweets, comments, and replies on Twitter, taking into account the contextual intricacies inherent in social media communication. In this context, contextual nuances play a crucial role in understanding communication dynamics. By employing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques tailored to the unique linguistic characteristics of each language, this research makes a significant contribution to the development of robust and culturally sensitive hate speech detection systems. Such systems are essential for creating safer online environments and promoting cross-cultural understanding.

abstract = {Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are widely researched in the field of security because of their unique, robust, and reliable nature, PUFs are considered device-specific root keys that are hard to duplicate. There are many variants of PUFs that are being studied and implemented including hardware and software PUFs. Though PUFs are believed to be secure and reliable, they are not without challenges of their own. The efficient performance of PUF depends on various environmental factors, which leads to inefficiency. Bit flipping is one such problem that can bring down the reliability of the PUF. Memory-based PUFs are prone to unavoidable bit flips occurring in the hardware, similarly, sensor-based PUFs are prone to bit flips occurring due to temperature variation. The number of errors in the PUF response must be minimized to improve the reliability of the PUF in security applications. In this research we explore the Machine Learning (ML) model based on K-mer sequencing to detect and correct the bit flips in the PUFs, hence fortifying the PUF-based secure authentication system for authentication and authorization of Edge Data Centers (EDC) in a Collaborative Edge Computing (CEC) Environment.},

abstract = {In the social and organizational sciences, accountability has been linked to the efficient operation of organizations. However, it has received limited attention in software engineering (SE) research, in spite of its central role in the most popular software development methods (e.g., Scrum). In this article, we explore the mechanisms of accountability in SE environments. We investigate the factors that foster software engineers' individual accountability within their teams through an interview study with 12 people. Our findings recognize two primary forms of accountability shaping software engineers individual senses of accountability: institutionalized and grassroots. While the former is directed by formal processes and mechanisms, like performance reviews, grassroots accountability arises organically within teams, driven by factors such as peers' expectations and intrinsic motivation. This organic form cultivates a shared sense of collective responsibility, emanating from shared team standards and individual engineers' inner commitment to their personal, professional values, and self-set standards. While institutionalized accountability relies on traditional "carrot and stick" approaches, such as financial incentives or denial of promotions, grassroots accountability operates on reciprocity with peers and intrinsic motivations, like maintaining one's reputation in the team.},

However, the security perimeter of existing TEEs is limited to a single centralized machine, which contradicts with the growing trend of employing disaggregated computing resources (e.g., disaggregated memory) to achieve high performance and resource utilization. To address this limitation, we develop DM-TEE, a customized trusted execution environment supporting the emerging disaggregated memory architecture. DM-TEE extends the traditional TEEs from local memory to remote disaggregated memory, which is achieved by a newly designed secure memory allocation and access workflow to ensure the data confidentiality and integrity in the disaggregated memory. We implement DM-TEE on real hardware using Intel SGX and a state-of-the-art memory disaggregation system. Our evaluations on memory allocation, read/write operations, and benchmark program executions indicate that DM-TEE achieves the desired disaggregated memory security with minimal performance overhead.},

abstract = {The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing devices has become an essential aspect of our daily routines. Particularly, the rise of wearable technology like smartwatches, health trackers, and smart glasses has contributed significantly to their popularity. These gadgets are equipped with diverse sensors that enable researchers and manufacturers to collect user data. Subsequently, this data undergoes processing through on-device Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, enhancing user interactions. However, implementing ML algorithms on these compact IoTs and edge devices consumes substantial power and energy. It’s crucial to recognize that these devices operate within strict energy and power constraints. Thus, optimizing battery usage is paramount for prolonging a device’s lifespan. Therefore, we propose a Processing-In-Memory (PIM) architecture utilizing Look-up-Table (LUT) based processing for improved performance and energy efficiency. To further enhance energy efficiency in this work we introduce a framework that efficiently utilizes kinetic energy harvesting to intermittently support ML computations/tasks, thereby alleviating the load on the device’s built-in battery. By offloading ML computations to the PIM architecture, the framework reduces the reliance on the device’s internal battery power, optimizing the use of harvested kinetic energy and extending battery life. Furthermore, PIM architecture facilitates seamless integration of harvested kinetic energy, ensuring efficient ML computations with minimal energy consumption. This integrated approach presents a compelling solution for energy management in IoT and edge-based applications, as evidenced by experiments and analysis showing significant reductions in overall energy usage. We evaluated the proposed Energy Harvesting-assisted PIM architecture on various CNN architectures, such as LeNet, AlexNet, ResNet -18, -34, -50.},

Orthogonal to existing approximate computing mechanisms, this work proposes a Feature-Driven Approximation (FDApx) method to address the pressing need for fast data processing and a limited storage budget in wearable health monitoring devices. The proposed FDApx method reverses the features interested in high-level applications to derive approximation thresholds to retain feature-critical information, rather than aimlessly storing and transmitting all raw data. Case studies in an insole sensing system for fall risk assessment show that FDApx can reduce the data size by up to 87\% over raw data and up to 85\% over 2-bit precision reduction-based approximation. The approximation from FDApx only results in up to a 2\% deviation in swing time; in contrast, the approximation based on precision reduction causes a 30\% deviation in the same gait feature1.},

In general, the number of antennas deployed on WiFi sensors is no more than three and the multipath effect is aggravated in indoor environments. Without increasing the time overhead, spatial and temporal resources are scarce, which makes it difficult to satisfy the uniqueness of tensor decomposition. To address this problem, we design a new tensor reconstruction scheme by utilizing the abundant frequency resource in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Based on the reconstructed tensor model, we develop iterative and non-iterative estimation algorithms to recover the accuracy sensing parameters. Then, the estimated sensing parameters related to the line-of-sight (LOS) path are used for indoor positioning. We also derive the Cram\'{e}r Rao bound (CRB) as a performance benchmark. Simulation results show that the proposed method provides better estimation and positioning performance with lower complexity than the existing advanced methods.},

To address the imperative of environmentally responsible ML, we present in this paper a novel ML pipeline, named CEMAI, designed to monitor and analyze carbon emissions across the entire lifecycle of ML model development, from data preparation to training and deployment. Our endeavor involves an exhaustive evaluation process underpinned by three industrial case studies. These case studies are structured around the application of ML models to predict tool wear, estimate remaining useful lifetimes, and detect anomalies in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Leveraging sensor data originating from CNC machining and broaching operations, our research shows empirically the efficacy of carbon emissions as a dependable metric guiding the configuration of an ML development process. The essence of our approach lies in striking a balance between superior performance and minimal carbon emissions. Our findings reveal the potential to optimize pipeline configurations for ML models in a manner that not only enhances performance but also drastically reduces carbon emissions, thereby underlining the significance of adopting ecologically responsible engineering practices.},

abstract = {The correlation analysis between socioeconomic factors and environmental impact is essential for policy making to ensure sustainability and economic development simultaneously. With the development of Internet of Things (IoT), citizen science IoT monitoring provides valuable environmental measurements, such as PM 2.5 for air quality monitoring. However, socioeconomic factors are usually interconnected and confound each other, making accurate correlation analysis challenging. To isolate this information on an individual socioeconomic factor, we need to mitigate the confounding effect (e.g., propensity score matching) of other factors on the environmental sensing data. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in data reasoning, making us wonder if they can conduct causal reasoning and answer questions like "What is the most important socioeconomic factor that impacts regional air quality?"In this paper, we present a new evaluation framework named "Order-of-Thought" based on Bloom's Taxonomy pedagogical framework to quantify the LLMs' ability for causal reasoning. We apply this evaluation framework with both natural language-based and program-based prompting strategies. Our evaluation uncovers the exceptional potentials of LLMs in causal reasoning for sensing data analysis, offering valuable insights regarding their capabilities and limitations, and providing useful directions to further achieve a higher-order thought.},

abstract = {Digital twins, which are increasingly adopted in industry, are model-centric systems used to improve the behavior of a twinned physical system. Seen as a whole, this system has several layers of self-adaptation: first, the digital twin manages its physical counterpart and maintains its models through a feedback loop to, e.g., fine-tune model parameters. Second, the digital twin needs to deal with unforeseen changes in the composition of the physical system, which require models to be partly replaced or recomposed. To facilitate research on self-adaptive digital twins, without requiring access to industrial production systems, this paper presents GreenhouseDT, an exemplar that explicitly separates these layers of self-adaptation. GreenhouseDT provides an extensible software architecture for a digital twin of a simple, low-cost greenhouse, in which plants, sensors and water pumps constitute the physical system. GreenhouseDT includes an asset model in the digital twin's knowledge base and uses reflection to lift twinned configurations into the knowledge base. We discuss how GreenhouseDT can be extended with different digital twin capabilities, demonstrated by the addition of plant health monitoring and model-based control.},

The multiple unified models have been developed for multiple tasks such as multi-focus (MF), multi-exposure (ME), and multi-modal (MM) image fusion. The careful tuning of such models is required to get optimal results, which are still not applicable to diverse applications. We propose an automatic machine learning (AML) based multi-tasking image fusion approach to overcome this problem. Initially, we evaluate source images with AML and feed them to the task-based models. Then, the source images are fused with the pre-trained and fine-tuned models.

abstract = {Context. Women remain significantly underrepresented in software engineering, leading to a lasting gender gap in the software industry. This disparity starts in education and extends into the industry, causing challenges such as hostile work environments and unequal opportunities. Addressing these issues is crucial for fostering an inclusive and diverse software engineering workforce. Aim. This study aims to enhance the literature on women in software engineering, exploring their journey from academia to industry and discussing perspectives, challenges, and support. We focus on Brazilian women to extend existing research, which has largely focused on North American and European contexts. Method. In this study, we conducted a cross-sectional survey, collecting both quantitative and qualitative data, focusing on women's experiences in software engineering to explore their journey from university to the software industry. Findings. Our findings highlight persistent challenges faced by women in software engineering, including gender bias, harassment, work-life imbalance, undervaluation, low sense of belonging, and impostor syndrome. These difficulties commonly emerge from university experiences and continue to affect women throughout their entire careers. Conclusion. In summary, our study identifies systemic challenges in women's software engineering journey, emphasizing the need for organizational commitment to address these issues. We provide actionable recommendations for practitioners.LAY ABSTRACT. Women in software engineering confront enduring underrepresentation, creating a gender gap evident from education to industry. Increasing the participation of women in the software industry is essential for the development of systems that reflect the diversity of our society. This study explores women's journey within software engineering, highlighting challenges and proposing strategies for software companies to address gender imbalance effectively.},

abstract = {This paper explores the use of federated learning in a realistic household employing existing infrastructure to add new devices and locations by rotating the role of the transmitter among smart devices in a multi-person scenario. Current solutions employ channel state information-based sensing for health care monitoring in various ways to propagate knowledge efficiently; however, these solutions often consider (i) ideally placed devices in (ii) single-participant scenarios and (iii) do not consider the different roles of these devices in a network. Data is collected from four smart devices in a household, assuming three participants, one of which is monitored and the other two function as noise, are assigned to perform activities to replicate a realistic household scenario. Insights are provided on using federated learning in realistic at-home health care when adding a new activity location and client devices, both transmitter-only and full communication devices. Results indicate new devices and locations can quickly be adopted with less data by the federated model without intensive retraining, even in multi-person environments, when doing extensive pre-training.},

abstract = {Memory Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) allows attackers to manipulate the DRAM of infiltrated systems to leak sensitive secret information. Although most of the existing works have demonstrated its feasibility, practical concerns, such as the ideal electromagnetic environment and stationary attacking layout, make the covert channel attack less convincing, especially in vulnerable sites such as offices and data centers. This work removes the above impractical assumptions to uncover the potential of memory EMR by proposing the first parallel EMR covert communication protocol. Our design reshapes the current "1-to-1" covert communication mode to "n-to-1" mode via a novel pattern-based 2-dimensional symbol encoding scheme, allowing multiple victim computers to simultaneously perform data exfiltration to one attacker (the receiver) without mutual interference. Meanwhile, this novel scheme design also enables the very first mobile attacker, i.e., a smartphone connected to a software-defined radio (SDR) dongle, to capture parallel memory EMR signals in a volatile environment. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the performance in a volatile environment with different parameter configurations, distances, motion modes, shielding materials, orientations, hardware configurations, and SDR platforms. Our experimental results demonstrate that FreeEM can support up to 4 parallel memory EMR transmissions to achieve an overall throughput of 625Kbps and a decoding accuracy of 96.88\%. The maximum communication distance can reach up to 20 meters.},

abstract = {Privacy concerns over the security of personal information have grown in tandem with the spread of smartwatches. However, effective methods for protecting private data on smartwatches are very limited. Personal identity number (PIN) input is the only privacy protection method on off-the-shelf smartwatches, which requires tedious user effort. This is ineffective at securing information such as notifications and attention-grabbing alerts, which may leak personal data to passersby and adversaries, causing embarrassment or revealing sensitive communications. In this work, we propose a novel privacy protection system, TouchTone, that verifies users and secure personal data in a convenient and low-effort manner. Our system employs a challenge-response process to passively capture finger biometrics from an unobtrusive touch gesture using only microphones, speakers, and accelerometer sensors already built in smartwatches. To address smartwatch incompatibility with traditional high-frequency sensing techniques, we develop non-intrusive low-frequency challenge signals and cross-domain sensing techniques (i.e., measuring acoustic signals in the vibration domain) to capture robust and effective features specific to user fingers. A low-cost profile matching-based classifier is designed to enable stand-alone privacy protection on smartwatches. We conduct extensive experiments with 54 participants using varied hardware, environments, noise levels, user motions, and other impact factors, achieving around 97\% true positive rate and 2\% false positive rate in recognizing participants' identities for privacy protection.},
