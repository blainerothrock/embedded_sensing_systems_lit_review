abstract = {Perceiving and altering the sensation of internal physiological states, such as heartbeats, is key for biofeedback and interoception. Yet, wearable devices used for this purpose can feel intrusive and typically fail to deliver stimuli aligned with the heart’s location in the chest. To address this, we introduce Heartbeat Resonance, which uses low-frequency sound waves to create non-contact haptic sensations in the chest cavity, mimicking heartbeats. We conduct two experiments to evaluate the system’s effectiveness. The first experiment shows that the system created realistic heartbeat sensations in the chest, with 78.05 Hz being the most effective frequency. In the second experiment, we evaluate the effects of entrainment by simulating faster and slower heart rates. Participants perceived the intended changes and reported high confidence in their perceptions for +15\% and -30\% heart rates. This system offers a non-intrusive solution for biofeedback while creating new possibilities for immersive VR environments.},

abstract = {We introduce Power-on-Touch, a novel method for powering devices during interaction. Power-on-Touch comprises two main components: (1) a wearable-transmitter attached to the user's body (e.g., fingernail, back of the hand, feet) with wireless power-coils and a battery; and (2) receiver-tags embedded in interactive devices, making them battery-free. Many devices only require power during interaction (e.g., TV remotes, digital calipers). We leverage this interactive opportunity by inductively transferring energy from the user's coil to the device's coil when in close proximity. To achieve this, we engineered receiver-tags and coils, including thin pancake-coils best-suited for wearables and spherical-coils that receive power omnidirectionally. To understand which coils best support a wide range of interactions (e.g., grasping, touching, hovering), we performed technical characterizations, including impedance and 3D efficiency analysis. We believe our technical approach can inspire ubiquitous computing with new ways to scale up the number and diversity of battery-free devices, not just sensors (µWatts) but also actuators (Watts).},

abstract = {Viscous materials such as inks, gels, pastes, and slurries are ubiquitous across domains like food science, smart materials, digital fabrication, and the arts. However, their dynamic and unpredictable behavior—shifting over time and in response to environmental factors—poses challenges, often requiring costly equipment for accurate rheological analysis. This paper presents a low-cost, accessible sensing routine that retracts and extrudes viscous materials through an air tube, generating sensor vectors rich in rheological data. By embedding data from 26 rheologically diverse materials into a two-dimensional space, we create RheoMaps that allow for tracking material changes over time, distinguishing concentrations, and tuning rheological behaviors. These maps offer practical benefits for detecting preparation errors, guiding material design and documentation, and providing tutorial waypoints. We further discuss how this approach can be extended to extract relational insights from sensor data, improving material literacy and manipulation across a range of applications.},

By imitating auditory localization processes, we enable vibrotactile localization abilities similar to those of some spiders, elephants, and other species. We evaluated this concept in virtual reality by modulating the vibration amplitude of two controllers depending on relative locations to a target. We developed two implementations applying this method using either ear or hand locations. A proof-of-concept study assessed localization performance and user experience, achieving under 30° differentiation between horizontal targets with no prior training. This unique approach enables localization by using only two actuators, requires low computational power, and could potentially assist users in gaining spatial awareness in challenging environments. We compare the implementations and discuss the use of hands as ears in motion, a novel technique not previously explored in the sensory substitution literature.},

abstract = {We present BioTube, a sustainable and highly accessible DIY fabrication approach for creating hollow tubular alginate, and demonstrate its potential for making biodegradable transient devices. This technique involves extruding alginate into a calcium solution, initiating a progressive crosslinking process that starts from the outer shell and progresses inward. This controlled process removes the uncrosslinked core before complete gelation, yielding hollow alginate fibers. To further enhance the capabilities of BioTube, we explored three further crosslinking strategies to customize the fiber shape, local cross-sectional geometry, and stiffness. The versatility of this method is demonstrated through three key functional primitives: shape, morphing, and sensing. These capabilities are further illustrated through five application examples, including transient wearables, edible shape-changing interfaces, experimental gastronomy, underwater grippers, and sacrificial casting molds. We believe that BioTube will expand the design possibilities for alginate, enabling the creation of innovative biodegradable devices.},

abstract = {What if our clothes could capture our body motion accurately? This paper introduces Flexible Inertial Poser (FIP), a novel motion-capturing system using daily garments with two elbow-attached flex sensors and four Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). To address the inevitable sensor displacements in loose wearables which degrade joint tracking accuracy significantly, we identify the distinct characteristics of the flex and inertial sensor displacements and develop a Displacement Latent Diffusion Model and a Physics-informed Calibrator to compensate for sensor displacements based on such observations, resulting in a substantial improvement in motion capture accuracy. We also introduce a Pose Fusion Predictor to enhance multimodal sensor fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves robust performance across varying body shapes and motions, significantly outperforming SOTA IMU approaches with a 19.5\% improvement in angular error, a 26.4\% improvement in elbow angular error, and a 30.1\% improvement in positional error. FIP opens up opportunities for ubiquitous human-computer interactions and diverse interactive applications such as Metaverse, rehabilitation, and fitness analysis.

abstract = {As HCI research turns to women’s reproductive health as a topic of interest, an increasing number of female-oriented technologies (FemTech) are being marketed to consumers. This opens up a space for better management and understanding of intimate health but is not without risk. Reproductive health data collected by FemTech devices is highly sensitive and politicized. Breaches of privacy can cause or exacerbate discrimination and gender inequality, and negatively impact users’ safety and well-being. It is therefore important that users are well informed about how their data is collected, handled, used and stored. This work contributes insights into whether and to what extent this is achieved by current FemTech. We conduct a structured content analysis of 18 in-effect privacy policies. Applying an empirically-grounded taxonomy, we identify challenges in policy wording, content and presentation. We conclude with recommendations for improving transparency and supporting users in providing informed consent and claiming data authority.},

abstract = {While users could embody virtual avatars that mirror their physical movements in Virtual Reality, these avatars’ motions can be redirected to enable novel interactions. Excessive redirection, however, could break the user’s sense of embodiment due to perceptual conflicts between vision and proprioception. While prior work focused on avatar-related factors influencing the noticeability of redirection, we investigate how the visual stimuli in the surrounding virtual environment affect user behavior and, in turn, the noticeability of redirection. Given the wide variety of different types of visual stimuli and their tendency to elicit varying individual reactions, we propose to use users’ gaze behavior as an indicator of their response to the stimuli and model the noticeability of redirection. We conducted two user studies to collect users’ gaze behavior and noticeability, investigating the relationship between them and identifying the most effective gaze behavior features for predicting noticeability. Based on the data, we developed a regression model that takes users’ gaze behavior as input and outputs the noticeability of redirection. We then conducted an evaluation study to test our model on unseen visual stimuli, achieving an accuracy of 0.012 MSE. We further implemented an adaptive redirection technique and conducted a preliminary study to evaluate its effectiveness with complex visual stimuli in two applications. The results indicated that participants experienced less physical demanding and a stronger sense of body ownership when using our adaptive technique, demonstrating the potential of our model to support real-world use cases.},

For privacy reasons, this data must remain inaccessible to unauthorized parties, and cloud providers can also not derive any information from the stored sensitive data. To address these challenges, attribute-based public key searchable encryption (ABSE) technology enables secure retrieval and fine-grained access control over encrypted data. Nevertheless, most existing ABSE schemes lack flexibility and efficiency, which limits their practical applications. In this paper, we present a secure and efficient fine-grained encrypted keyword search scheme for the Internet of Things, named SPEKS. Our scheme leverages subset predicate encryption to achieve highly adaptable and flexible access control policies in multi-user environments. The security analysis demonstrates that SPEKS is secure against chosen keyword attacks. Additionally, by contrasting with other related schemes, it is evident that our proposed scheme offers flexible access control while reducing computation and communication costs.},

abstract = {Bio-inspired event sensors are gaining popularity at the edge, such as in robots and wearable electronics. This trend necessitates learning vast amounts of sensory data on the edge, often in few-shot or even zero-shot scenarios, posing challenges in both software and hardware. This paper presents a novel software-hardware co-design to address these issues. Software-wise, we develop an SNN-ANN model, where the SNN encoder is a liquid state machine (LSM) that naturally processes events and significantly reduces learning complexity at the edge due to fixed random weights. The lightweight trainable ANN projection heads are optimized through contrastive learning, enabling zero-shot learning of multimodal events. Hardware-wise, we propose a hybrid analog (RRAM)-digital (CMOS) accelerator - LSMR. The analog in-memory computing core physically implements the LSM by leveraging RRAM stochasticity to generate fixed random weights. The digital core utilizes innovative reconfigurable systolic arrays to accelerate the contrastive learning of ANN projection heads. Extensive experimental outcomes from six neuromorphic datasets, encompassing visual, tactile, and auditory modalities, demonstrate that LSMR considerably improves energy efficiency by a range of 1.65\texttimes{} to 23.70\texttimes{}, in comparison to state-of-the-art edge devices. Simultaneously, it reduces training complexity by a range of 152.83\texttimes{} to 20,587.77\texttimes{} across various edge learning tasks.},

However, the substantial computational overhead associated with homomorphic evaluations restricts the practical application of FHE schemes. To deal with the performance challenges, this paper proposes a hardware/software pipeline framework with a three-level cache architecture to accelerate the costly Key-Switching operation in FHE. This framework supports the dynamically reconfigurable processing mode, two parallelism strategies, and flexible control flow, effectively breaking the compute-bound and the memory-bound limitations.

abstract = {In machine learning (ML), near-sensor AI is transforming edge computing by reducing response times and data transmission, ultimately saving energy and bandwidth. Despite challenges like limited computational resources and the need for transparent decision-making, this approach aims to enhance the intelligence and autonomy of edge devices. Our research presents a novel framework that adds a layer of abstract intelligence to sensors, boosting system efficiency and accuracy through transparent, interpretable sub-symbolic AI. We combine Bayesian algorithms with hyperdimensional computing (HDC), inspired by the human brain's operational efficiency, to deliver an energy-efficient solution matching the accuracy of traditional cloud systems without constant server dependence. This framework uses a binary classifier with Bayesian insights to choose the best data processing location---locally or in the cloud---adapting to data environments. Our method ensures cloud-level performance while significantly reducing energy consumption, improving the sustainability of sensor-based systems. It also enables continual adaptation and learning directly at the sensor level, enriching cloud models with fresh edge insights. Our results have shown to bridge the gap from around 38\% quality loss between the standalone near-sensor HDC model and the SOTA cloud-based model to improve the quality loss to only 9\% while simultaneously saving 45.34\% of energy by not using the cloud. This framework paves the way for more sustainable, efficient, and accurate edge computing in the ML landscape by bridging the gap between simple near-sensor models and their advanced cloud-based counterparts.},

abstract = {This study presents the development of a student-centric framework for utilizing virtual reality (VR) technologies in education, specifically focusing on enhancing computational thinking skills. While numerous frameworks exist in this domain, they often lack consideration of student preferences, which are integral for fostering learner autonomy. Our proposed framework, with components developed from the constructivist learning theory, emphasises creating knowledge through interaction with the environment, focusing on autonomy, mastery and purpose as drivers of intrinsic outcomes. Through a survey administered to hundred and fifty-seven participants, we sought to identify student-preferred strategies for learning computational thinking skills via VR interventions. Results highlighted key challenges students face when working on computational tasks are related to algorithmic and abstraction thinking. To ease the aforementioned challenges, our findings suggest a preference among students for situated-based learning approaches within VR environments. Additionally, participants recognized the importance of motivational outcomes in improving autonomy and mastery within VR-based learning tasks. Students also preferred tasks that enhanced self-efficacy, contributing to a greater sense of purpose in their learning endeavours. Overall, this investigation sets a foundation for more student-centric, constructivist and intrinsically-based VR frameworks in education.},

abstract = {The rapid expansion of multi-cloud environments and the growing prevalence of collaborative data ownership present significant challenges in ensuring the verifiable deletion of co-owned data. Current approaches predominantly address individual ownership and often rely on simplistic one-bit result protocols where a deletion command merely outputs success or failure, turning the deletion into a black box without proper verification. This paper tackles the problem of secure processing and verifiable deletion of shared outsourced data in multi-cloud environments. We design a framework that enables a data owner to outsource encrypted data to multiple co-owners, who perform computations directly within their respective cloud providers---ensuring that sensitive data never leaves the cloud. Our system leverages readily available cloud Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) to manage cryptographic keys from generation to controlled destruction---ensuring data remains inaccessible beyond its intended use. Secure Enclaves enforce on-cloud data computation, eliminating local copies and preventing unauthorized exposure. Encrypted data is structured within a fixed storage model, ensuring controlled allocation and strict storage constraints. When data expires or must be deleted to meet regulatory requirements, our framework triggers zero-residual permuted overwriting to remove the data traces irreversibly. Verifiability is achieved at two levels: Bounded Merkle Hash Tree (BMHT) ensures bounded storage and verifiable deletion within each cloud provider. In contrast, Global Merkle Forest (GMF) aggregates BMHT roots across providers, enabling consistent global verification. The data owner maintains a log of these BMHT roots, allowing independent verification of secure deletion across the multi-cloud environment.},

abstract = {Rivers constitute a crucial element of the natural environment, playing an indispensable role in ecosystem dynamics. Investigating river systems not only facilitates the sustainable management of water resources but also advances ecological preservation, alongside social and economic development. Considering escalating global challenges such as climate change, population pressures, and environmental degradation, acquiring a comprehensive understanding of river resources is imperative for addressing both current and future ecological dilemmas. This study employs high-spatial-resolution remote sensing imagery Gaofen-2 (GF-2) alongside two deep learning models: k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Decision Tree (DT), to conduct river segmentation within the context of Zhuhai, a city characterized by abundant river resources. The research utilizes a 10-fold cross-validation approach and the grid search method to ascertain the optimal parameters for each model, aiming to enhance training accuracy. Comparative analysis indicates that the kNN model outperforms the DT model across various evaluation metrics and segmentation outcomes. The findings of this research contribute valuable theoretical insights and technical support for effective river management strategies, enabling governmental bodies to formulate more scientifically grounded and rational policies and measures for sustainable development.},

abstract = {In recent years, the deployment of deep learning models has extended beyond typical cloud environments to resource-constrained devices such as edge devices and smartphones. This shift is driven by their success in learning and detecting patterns in data. However, deep models are often excessively large and lack robustness to minor input transformations. To solve the challenge, deep learning models are often trained with data augmentation, which requires an even larger model to accommodate the additional knowledge. In this paper, we study ways to mitigate these problems by leveraging additional sensing modalities to a) adapt the input data and b) adapt the model for typical transformations. We show that both approaches increase the accuracy of deep learning models by up to 6.21\% and 7.57\% respectively, while using roughly the same number of parameters or even less at inference time. We furthermore study how well these approaches can handle noisy sensor readings.},

abstract = {The integration of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) sensors and devices into traditional manufacturing environments offers significant benefits in terms of efficiency, adaptability, and data-driven decision-making. However, the transition from traditional manufacturing systems to smart manufacturing systems, often achieved through retrofitting legacy systems, introduces new security risks that must be carefully addressed to ensure operational resilience. This paper explores the vulnerabilities and threats associated with retrofitting legacy systems with modern Industrial IoT technologies. By examining recent case studies and industry incidents, critical security gaps that emerge from the coexistence of legacy systems and contemporary IoT solutions are identified. These gaps include unauthorized access, data breaches, system manipulation. The research emphasizes the necessity of adopting a proactive cybersecurity approach that is well-suited to the specific vulnerabilities and risks associated with retrofitting traditional manufacturing systems. These measures include updated security protocols, enhanced device management practices, secure software updates, and ongoing system monitoring. By implementing these strategies, manufacturers can mitigate risks, protect their intellectual property, and maintain operational continuity. Outcome of the paper provide manufacturers with strategic insights and practical recommendations to safeguard the integrity and reliability of their smart manufacturing environments against evolving cyber threats. By addressing these security challenges proactively, organizations can realize the full potential of IIoT technologies while minimizing risks to their operations.},

abstract = {Cooperative embodied systems, where multiple agents collaborate through integrated perception, planning, action, and advanced reasoning powered by large language models (LLMs), show great potential for tackling complex, long-horizon, multi-objective tasks in real-world environments. Despite these algorithmic advancements, deploying embodied agents on current systems remains challenging due to prolonged planning and communication latency, limited scalability, and heightened sensitivity in low-level execution, all of which lead to significant system inefficiencies. This work proposes ReCA, a characterization and co-design framework dedicated to cooperative embodied agent system acceleration, aiming to enhance both task efficiency and system scalability. On the algorithm level, ReCA enables efficient local model processing to alleviate the substantial model costs. On the system level, ReCA presents a dual-memory structure with integrated long-term and short-term memory, hierarchical cooperative planning scheme with centralized and decentralized cooperation, and planning-guided multi-step execution for highly efficient and scalable cooperative embodied agent computation. On the hardware level, ReCA employs a heterogeneous hardware system with high-level planning GPU subsystem and low-level planning accelerator subsystem to ensure efficient and robust task execution. Evaluated across long-horizon multi-objective tasks, ReCA generalizes across application scenarios and system scales, achieving a 4.3\% increase in successful missions with 10.2\texttimes{} speedup compared to the state-of-the-art cooperative embodied autonomous agent systems.},

abstract = {Mixture of Experts (MoE), with its distinctive sparse structure, enables the scaling of language models up to trillions of parameters without significantly increasing computational costs. However, the substantial parameter size presents a challenge for inference, as the expansion in GPU memory cannot keep pace with the growth in parameters. Although offloading techniques utilise memory from the CPU and disk and parallelise the I/O and computation for efficiency, the computation for each expert in MoE models is often less than the I/O, resulting in numerous bubbles in the pipeline.Therefore, we propose Klotski, an efficient MoE inference engine that significantly reduces pipeline bubbles through a novel expert-aware multi-batch pipeline paradigm. The proposed paradigm uses batch processing to extend the computation time of the current layer to overlap with the loading time of the next layer. Although this idea has been effectively applied to dense models, more batches may activate more experts in the MoE, leading to longer loading times and more bubbles. Thus, unlike traditional approaches, we balance computation and I/O time and minimise bubbles by orchestrating their inference orders based on their heterogeneous computation and I/O requirements and activation patterns under different batch numbers. Moreover, to adapt to different hardware environments and models, we design a constraint-sensitive I/O-compute planner and a correlation-aware expert prefetcher for a schedule that minimises pipeline bubbles. Experimental results demonstrate that Klotski achieves a superior throughput-latency trade-off compared to state-of-the-art techniques, with throughput improvements of up to 85.12x.},

abstract = {Learning a skill is a complex cognitive task that requires processing multiple sensorimotor information. To help the skill learners, in this study, we explored and compared how to exploit AI wisely to teach skills. We set an initial target skill of engraving implemented on a haptic-audio-visual (HAV) VR environment. As the haptic device, we used a desktop force-feedback device to render the movement and force profile of the tooltip.To build teaching AI for engraving, we gathered experts’ motion and force profile data. Then, we designed an Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based AI model that discriminates the user’s behavior and status of the tooltip using the data. With the VR environment and the AI model, we compared and evaluated three teaching strategies for haptic dexterous skill transfer– Guidance, Disturbance, and Hybrid Assistance. Hybrid Assistance alters its force between Guidance and Disturbance based on the user’s performance. We conducted a user experiment with seven sessions: one pre-test, three main training, one immediate retention, and two delayed retention sessions. In the results, we found: 1) Guidance showed a steep learning curve during the training sessions, but the participants lost the learning effect in the retention sessions, and 2) the learning with Hybrid Assistance was the slowest but remained longer, even showed a better performance in delayed retention tests. These results seem to follow a guidance hypothesis in learning, which suggests how to design the AI model to determine its policy to provide the best performance for the user’s training.},

abstract = {Affordances, a foundational concept in human-computer interaction and design, have traditionally been explained by direct-perception theories, which assume that individuals perceive action possibilities directly from the environment. However, these theories fall short of explaining how affordances are perceived, learned, refined, or misperceived, and how users choose between multiple affordances in dynamic contexts. This paper introduces a novel affordance theory grounded in Computational Rationality, positing that humans construct internal representations of the world based on bounded sensory inputs. Within these internal models, affordances are inferred through two core mechanisms: feature recognition and hypothetical motion trajectories. Our theory redefines affordance perception as a decision-making process, driven by two components: confidence (the perceived likelihood of successfully executing an action) and predicted utility (the expected value of the outcome). By balancing these factors, individuals make informed decisions about which actions to take. Our theory frames affordances perception as dynamic, continuously learned, and refined through reinforcement and feedback. We validate the theory via thought experiments and demonstrate its applicability across diverse types of affordances (e.g., physical, digital, social). Beyond clarifying and generalizing the understanding of affordances across contexts, our theory serves as a foundation for improving design communication and guiding the development of more adaptive and intuitive systems that evolve with user capabilities.},

An accurate propagation model is essential for efficiently deploying a LoRa network in orchards, e.g., determining gateway coverage and sensor placement. Although some propagation models have been studied for LoRa networks, they are not suitable for orchard environments, because they do not consider the shadowing effect on wireless propagation caused by the ground and tree canopies. This article presents FLog, a propagation model for LoRa signals in orchard environments. FLog leverages a unique feature of orchards, i.e., all trees have similar shapes and are planted regularly in space. We develop a three-dimensional model of orchards. Once we have the location of a sensor and a gateway, we know the media that the wireless signal traverses. Based on this knowledge, we generate the First Fresnel Zone (FFZ) between the sender and the receiver. The intrinsic path loss exponents of all media can be combined into a classic Log-Normal Shadowing model in the FFZ. Extensive experiments in almond orchards show that FLog reduces the link quality estimation error by 42.7\% and improves gateway coverage estimation accuracy by 70.3\%, compared with a widely used propagation model.

By leveraging manufacturing variations in a device one can generate unique signatures that can be used for authentication and generation of secret keys. However, PUF implementation can be costly, taking up FPGA resources and requiring long design times.

We provide detailed implementation guidelines and evaluate the PUF’s signature quality and stability under different environmental variations using a set of testbench circuits.

abstract = {Wireless systems are entering the arena of time-critical applications, including industrial controls. This makes clock synchronisation vital. A relevant source of synchronisation errors, especially in heavy-duty applications and harsh environments, is given by temperature variations that affect the quartz oscillators. This article takes a control theory-based approach and proposes to augment clock synchronisation schemes—that are typically feedback-based—with a feedforward compensation path using temperature measurements to quickly react to temperature change. Unlike previous approaches relying on per-device data, our solution takes advantage of the combined feedforward-feedback nature of the control scheme to perform compensation using only nominal crystal parameters. When implemented in conjunction with the FLOPSYNC-2 feedback-based clock synchronisation scheme and tested both in simulation and experimentally, the approach resulted in a greatly reduced synchronisation error during temperature transients. In detail, Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed solution can reduce the peak clock synchronisation error on average by 5.3 (times)  and in the worst case by 2.2 (times) , thus proving applicable and effective without the need for a costly per-device calibration. When tested experimentally on a network of sensor nodes, a 3.3 (times)  peak clock synchronisation error improvement was observed, confirming the simulation predictions.},

abstract = {In IoT-enabled smart home scenarios, heterogeneous communication devices such as Bluetooth (BT) and Wi-Fi are widely used in applications such as home automation, remote monitoring, and intelligent device interconnection. However, in such a multi-device coexistence environment, efficiently allocating limited time-frequency resources to mitigate communication interference and enhance system performance has become a critical challenge. To address these issues, this article proposes a comprehensive solution that integrates master selection, resource allocation, and task scheduling to optimize resource utilization and service quality in smart home IoT systems. For device management, we propose a hierarchical entropy weight method (HEWM), considering factors such as device parameters, sensing capabilities, communication performance, and device interoperability. This method ensures efficient and stable selection of the primary device, optimizing network topology and communication efficiency. For resource allocation, we introduce a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm that dynamically adjusts time-frequency resource allocation based on the varying device usage, network load, and communication condition. This adaptive strategy reduces interference between devices and improves system throughput. For task scheduling, we develop a task urgency-based queueing (TUQ) mechanism that prioritizes tasks based on urgency. A task preemption mechanism ensures that high-urgency tasks are processed with minimal delay, enhancing scheduling efficiency and service responsiveness. Simulation results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms traditional methods in smart home IoT scenarios, achieving higher primary device scores, a 3\%–22\% improvement in system throughput, and a 5\%–36\% reduction in task delay.},

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a promising technique for decentralized privacy-preserving Machine Learning (ML) with a diverse pool of participating devices with varying device capabilities. However, existing approaches to handle such heterogeneous environments do not consider “fairness” in model aggregation, resulting in significant performance variation among devices. Meanwhile, prior works on FL fairness remain hardware-oblivious and cannot be applied directly without severe performance penalties. To address this issue, we propose a novel hardware-sensitive FL method called  (mathsf {FairHetero}) that promotes fairness among heterogeneous federated clients. Our approach offers tunable fairness within a group of devices with the same ML architecture as well as across different groups with heterogeneous models. Our evaluation under MNIST, FEMNIST, CIFAR10, and SHAKESPEARE datasets demonstrates that  (mathsf {FairHetero})  can reduce variance among participating clients’ test loss compared to the existing state-of-the-art techniques, resulting in increased overall performance.},

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) has gained attention across various industries for its capability to train machine learning models without centralizing sensitive data. While this approach offers significant benefits such as privacy preservation and decreased communication overhead, it presents several challenges, including deployment complexity and interoperability issues, particularly in heterogeneous scenarios or resource-constrained environments. Over-the-air (OTA) FL was introduced to tackle these challenges by disseminating model updates without necessitating direct device-to-device connections or centralized servers. However, OTA-FL brought forth limitations associated with heightened energy consumption and network latency. In this article, we propose a multi-attribute client selection framework employing the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) to strategically control the number of participants in each round and optimize the OTA-FL process while considering accuracy, energy, delay, reliability, and fairness constraints of participating devices. We evaluate the performance of our multi-attribute client selection approach in terms of model loss minimization, convergence time reduction, and energy efficiency. In our experimental evaluation, we assessed and compared the performance of our approach against the existing state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate that the proposed GWO-based client selection outperforms these baselines across various metrics. Specifically, our approach achieves a notable reduction in model loss, accelerates convergence time, and enhances energy efficiency while maintaining high fairness and reliability indicators.},

abstract = {In this paper, the performance of Low-Cost Sensors (LCS) for Air Quality (AQ) monitoring is analyzed. These sensors are unstable, unreliable and cannot replace the official ones. They suffer from deviations, drifts and errors that make them invalid for direct use, but through Machine Learning (ML) techniques, they can increase their overall accuracy. These sensors can be used in smart cities, increasing the sampling density of the AQ monitoring network, which could enable the development of new applications for citizens to plan healthy routes. After a review of the different AQ LCS, we focused on the Winsen’s ZPHS01B multisensor module because it embeds 11 different sensors in the same module. Since the information and the experimental data from field tests for this module is limited, we carry out different experiments and perform a thorough analysis, evaluating the sensor reading differences that could appear in a batch of them. We note that some of the integrated sensors are more reliable than others, but in practice they can improve their reading by using the ML models mentioned above, as they show correlation. Of all the modules tested, we observed that most of the sensors showed similar performance. However, a certain percentage of sensors in certain modules performed worse than their counterparts, which shows that at least 80\% of the tested multi-sensor modules had similar levels of performance.},

This paper introduces a novel TEE system, Dep-TEE, which decouples memory protection (to segments) from address translation (to page tables). This design improves communication performance by dynamically adjusting memory protection capabilities, without sacrificing application compatibility, and enhances security by safeguarding against attacks on page tables. We have built a prototype of Dep-TEE based on FPGA, incorporating hardware extensions and software support. The evaluation demonstrates that Dep-TEE significantly surpasses existing TEE solutions, achieving three orders of magnitude lower communication latency and 10x greater scalability while maintaining robust security guarantees.},

Bespoke research devices have shown the unique sensing capabilities of the earable platform; however, they are hard to replicate and require expertise to develop in the first place. In this paper, we present OpenEarable 2.0 - an open source, unified platform that integrates a larger number of sensors for conducting comprehensive earable research. OpenEarable 2.0 works as regular binaural Bluetooth earphones and features two ultrasound capable microphones (inward/outward), a 3-axis ear canal accelerometer/bone microphone, a 9-axis head inertial measurement unit, pulse oximeter, optical temperature sensor, ear canal pressure sensor, and microSD card. These capabilities allow for the detection and measurement of 30+ phenomena on the ear that can be used across a wide range of applications in health monitoring, activity tracking, human-computer-interaction and authentication. We describe the design and development of OpenEarable 2.0 which follows best open hardware practices and achieves commercial-level wearability. We provide justification for the selection and placement of integrated sensors and include in-depth descriptions of the extensible, open source firmware and hardware that are implemented using free to use tools and frameworks. For real-time sensor control and data recording we also contribute a web-based dashboard and mobile smartphone app. The wearability and ability to sense different phenomena are validated in four studies which showcases how OpenEarable 2.0 provides accurate measurements in comparison to established gold-standard measurements. We further demonstrate that OpenEarable 2.0 can be assembled by inexperienced users, and that undergraduate students can build applications using the OpenEarable platform.},

abstract = {Understanding everyday life behavior of young adults through personal devices, e.g., smartphones and smartwatches, is key for various applications, from enhancing the user experience in mobile apps to enabling appropriate interventions in digital health apps. Towards this goal, previous studies have relied on datasets combining passive sensor data with human-provided annotations or self-reports. However, many existing datasets are limited in scope, often focusing on specific countries primarily in the Global North, involving a small number of participants, or using a limited range of pre-processed sensors. These limitations restrict the ability to capture cross-country variations of human behavior, including the possibility of studying model generalization, and robustness. To address this gap, we introduce DiversityOne, a dataset which spans eight countries (China, Denmark, India, Italy, Mexico, Mongolia, Paraguay, and the United Kingdom) and includes data from 782 college students over four weeks. DiversityOne contains data from 26 smartphone sensor modalities and 350K+ self-reports. As of today, it is one of the largest and most diverse publicly available datasets, while featuring extensive demographic and psychosocial survey data. DiversityOne opens the possibility of studying important research problems in ubiquitous computing, particularly in domain adaptation and generalization across countries, all research areas so far largely underexplored because of the lack of adequate datasets.},

abstract = {Human activity recognition (HAR) using ambient sensors in smart homes has numerous applications for human healthcare and wellness. However, building general-purpose HAR models that can be deployed to new smart home environments requires a significant amount of annotated sensor data and training overhead. Most smart homes vary significantly in their layouts, i.e., floor plans and the specifics of sensors embedded, resulting in low generalizability of HAR models trained for specific homes. We address this limitation by introducing a novel, layout-agnostic modeling approach for HAR systems in smart homes that utilizes the transferrable representational capacity of natural language descriptions of raw sensor data. To this end, we generate Textual Descriptions Of Sensor Triggers (TDOST) that encapsulate the surrounding trigger conditions and provide cues for underlying activities to the activity recognition models. Leveraging textual embeddings, rather than raw sensor data, we create activity recognition systems that predict standard activities across homes without (re-)training or adaptation to target homes. Through an extensive evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TDOST-based models in unseen smart homes through experiments on benchmark Orange4Home and CASAS datasets. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of how the individual components of our approach affect downstream activity recognition performance.},

abstract = {Flexible capacitive pressure sensors are promising in applications of robotics, healthcare, and wearables, and are typically organized in array to realize large-area multi-point sensing. Specifically, the crossbar structure is the dominant form owing to its simple fabrication process. However, the crosstalk problem is induced, which is almost impossible to resolve using conventional methods. In this work, we analyze the structural characteristics of capacitive crossbar array. Based on that, we design a module that utilizes Multi-scale Asymmetric Convolution Block (MACB) for feature extraction and subsequently construct a lightweight neural network model named CAR-Net to remove capacitive crosstalk from measured value. To address the inherent error within the model, we develop an outlier removal method to enhance the accuracy of sensor calibration. Both simulation and measurement prove the effectiveness of the proposed model. Specifically, the capacitance recovery accuracy for 8\texttimes{}8, 16\texttimes{}16, and 32\texttimes{}32 array achieves 98.17\%, 97.7\%, and 95.74\%, respectively. Besides, we also validate with classification experiments that the crosstalk removal is beneficial to subsequent tasks in sensing system.},

This study also proposes Spatial Haptic Equalization (SHE), a method that computationally compensates spatial disuniformity in vibration intensity at haptic points using a data-driven approach for high-quality experiences. Additionally, our approach enables Indirect object actuation on furniture through propagated vibration. Our system requires only floor-installed pressure sensors and vibrotactile actuators. It also offers reconfigurability for spatial vibrotactile patterns, supporting diverse applications in entertainment and lifestyle.},

abstract = {The ever-evolving computing landscape gets more complex in every moment and the need for heterogeneous compute systems becomes more relevant. As the usability of such systems grew, finding methods for securing them became more relevant. Commercial vendors already introduced Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for those systems. TEEs serve the need for isolation, where sensitive data are processed in a secure world, and non-trusted applications are executed in the normal world. In this paper, we introduce Through Fabric: a novel attack against TEE-enhanced FPGA-MPSoCs. We show that existing benign hardware accelerators can be manipulated from the secure world to implement a temperature-based covert channel. We successfully run this attack on a commercial FPGA-MPSoC within the OP-TEE environment without additional access rights. We use an open-source implementation of AES for the accelerator and we reach a transmission speed of 2 bits per second with bit error rate of 1.9\% and packet error rate of 4.3\%. We are the first to show that a TEE can be bypassed on FPGA-MPSoCs via temperature-based covert channel communication.},

abstract = {Enabling computing systems to detect the objects that people hold and interact with provides valuable contextual information that has the potential to support a wide variety of mobile applications. However, existing approaches either directly instrument users' hands, which can reduce tactile sensation, or are limited in the types of objects and interactions they can detect. This work introduces HandSAW, a wireless wrist-worn device incorporating a Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) sensor with enhanced bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio while rejecting through-air sounds. The device features a sealed mass-spring diaphragm positioned on top of the sound port of a MEMS microphone, enabling it to capture SAWs generated by objects and through touch interaction events. This custom-designed wearable platform, paired with a real-time ML pipeline, can distinguish 20 passive object events with &gt;99\% per-user accuracy and a 91.6\% unseen-user accuracy, as validated through a 16-participant user study. For devices that do not emit SAWs, our active tags enable HandSAW to detect those objects and transmit encoded data using ultrasonic signals. Ultimately, HandSAW provides an easy-to-implement, robust, and cost-effective means for enabling user-object interaction and activity detection.},

abstract = {Flexible Electronics (FE) offer distinct advantages, including mechanical flexibility and low process temperatures, enabling extremely low-cost production. To address the demands of applications such as smart sensors and wearables, flexible devices must be small and operate at low supply voltages. Additionally, target applications often require classifiers to operate directly on analog sensory input, necessitating the use of Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs) to process the sensory data. However, ADCs present serious challenges, particularly in terms of high area and power consumption, especially when considering stringent area and energy budget. In this work, we target common classifiers in this domain such as MLPs and SVMs and present a holistic approach to mitigate the elevated overhead of analog to digital interfacing in FE. First, we propose a novel design for Binary Search ADC that reduces area overhead 2\texttimes{} compared with the state-of-the-art Binary design and up to 5.4\texttimes{} compared with Flash ADC. Next, we present an in-training ADC optimization in which we keep the bare-minimum representations required and simplifying ADCs by removing unnecessary components. Our in-training optimization further reduces on average the area in terms of transistor count of the required ADCs by 5\texttimes{} for less than 1\% accuracy loss.},
