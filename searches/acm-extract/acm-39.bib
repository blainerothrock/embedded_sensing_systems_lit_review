abstract = {As cameras and Wi-Fi access points are widely deployed in public places, new mobile applications and services can be developed by connecting live video analytics to the mobile Wi-Fi-enabled devices of the relevant users. To achieve this, a critical challenge is to identify the person who carries a device in the video with the mobile device's network ID, e.g., MAC address. To address this issue, we propose RFCam, a system for human identification with a fusion of Wi-Fi and camera data. RFCam uses a multi-antenna Wi-Fi radio to collect CSI of Wi-Fi packets sent by mobile devices, and a camera to monitor users in the area. With low sampling rate CSI data, RFCam derives heterogeneous embedding features on location, motion, and user activity for each device over time, and fuses them with visual user features generated from video analytics to find the best matches. To mitigate the impacts of multi-user environments on wireless sensing, we develop video-assisted learning models for different features and quantify their uncertainties, and incorporate them with video analytics to rank moments and features for robust and efficient fusion. RFCam is implemented and tested in indoor environments for over 800 minutes with 25 volunteers, and extensive evaluation results demonstrate that RFCam achieves real-time identification average accuracy of 97.01\% in all experiments with up to ten users, significantly outperforming existing solutions.},

abstract = {Collecting large-scale mobile and wearable sensor datasets from daily contexts is essential in developing machine learning models for enabling everyday affective computing applications. However, there is a lack of knowledge on data contributors' perceived benefits and risks in participating in open dataset collection projects. To bridge this gap, we conducted an in-situ study on building an open dataset with mobile and wearable devices for affective computing research (N = 100, 4 weeks). Our study results showed that a mixture of financial and altruistic benefits was important in eliciting data contribution. Sensor-specific risks were largely associated with the revelation of personal traits and social behaviors. However, most of the participants were less concerned with open dataset collection and their perceived sensitivity of each sensor data did not change over time. We further discuss alternative approaches to promote data contributors' motivations and suggest design guidelines to alleviate potential privacy concerns in mobile open dataset collection.},

abstract = {Automatically recognizing a broad spectrum of human activities is key to realizing many compelling applications in health, personal assistance, human-computer interaction and smart environments. However, in real-world settings, approaches to human action perception have been largely constrained to detecting mobility states, e.g., walking, running, standing. In this work, we explore the use of inertial-acoustic sensing provided by off-the-shelf commodity smartwatches for detecting activities of daily living (ADLs). We conduct a semi-naturalistic study with a diverse set of 15 participants in their own homes and show that acoustic and inertial sensor data can be combined to recognize 23 activities such as writing, cooking, and cleaning with high accuracy. We further conduct a completely in-the-wild study with 5 participants to better evaluate the feasibility of our system in practical unconstrained scenarios. We comprehensively studied various baseline machine learning and deep learning models with three different fusion strategies, demonstrating the benefit of combining inertial and acoustic data for ADL recognition. Our analysis underscores the feasibility of high-performing recognition of daily activities using inertial-acoustic data from practical off-the-shelf wrist-worn devices while also uncovering challenges faced in unconstrained settings. We encourage researchers to use our public dataset to further push the boundary of ADL recognition in-the-wild.},

In contrast to prior systems that need specialized hardware or dedicated sensors, our system does not require a user to wear or carry any sensors and can reuse the WiFi devices that already exist in a home environment for mass adoption. To realize such a system, we leverage the 2D AoA spectrum of the signals reflected from the human body and the deep learning techniques. In particular, the 2D AoA spectrum is proposed to locate different parts of the human body as well as to enable environment-independent pose estimation. Deep learning is incorporated to model the complex relationship between the 2D AoA spectrums and the 3D skeletons of the human body for pose tracking. Our evaluation results show GoPose achieves around 4.7cm of accuracy under various scenarios including tracking unseen activities and under NLoS scenarios.},

abstract = {Modern smartwatches or wrist wearables having multiple physiological sensing modalities have emerged as a subtle way to detect different mental health conditions, such as anxiety, emotions, and stress. However, affect detection models depending on wrist sensors data often provide poor performance due to inconsistent or inaccurate signals and scarcity of labeled data representing a condition. Although learning representations based on the physiological similarities of the affective tasks offer a possibility to solve this problem, existing approaches fail to effectively generate representations that will work across these multiple tasks. Moreover, the problem becomes more challenging due to the large domain gap among these affective applications and the discrepancies among the multiple sensing modalities. We present M3Sense, a multi-task, multimodal representation learning framework that effectively learns the affect-agnostic physiological representations from limited labeled data and uses a novel domain alignment technique to utilize the unlabeled data from the other affective tasks to accurately detect these mental health conditions using wrist sensors only. We apply M3Sense to 3 mental health applications, and quantify the achieved performance boost compared to the state-of-the-art using extensive evaluations and ablation studies on publicly available and collected datasets. Moreover, we extensively investigate what combination of tasks and modalities aids in developing a robust Multitask Learning model for affect recognition. Our analysis shows that incorporating emotion detection in the learning models degrades the performance of anxiety and stress detection, whereas stress detection helps to boost the emotion detection performance. Our results also show that M3Sense provides consistent performance across all affective tasks and available modalities and also improves the performance of representation learning models on unseen affective tasks by 5\% - 60\%.},

abstract = {Recently, the spy cameras spotted in private rental places have raised immense privacy concerns. The existing solutions for detecting them require additional support from synchronous external sensing or stimulus hardware such as on/off LED circuits, which require extra obligations from the user. For example, a user needs to carry a smartphone and laboriously perform preset motions (e.g., jumping, waving, and preplanned walking pattern) for synchronous sensing of acceleration signals. These requirements cause considerable discomfort to the user and limit the practicability of prevalent solutions. To cope with this, we propose CSI:DeSpy, an efficient and painless method by leveraging video bitrate fluctuations of the WiFi camera and the passively obtained Channel States Information (CSI) from user motion. CSI:DeSpy includes a self-adaptive feature that makes it robust to detect motion efficiently in multipath-rich environments. We implemented CSI:DeSpy on the Android platform and assessed its performance in diverse real-life scenarios, namely; (1) its reliability with the intensities of physical activities in diverse multipath-rich environments, (2) its practicability with activities of daily living, (3) its unobtrusiveness with passive sensing, and (4) its robustness to different network loads. CSI:DeSpy attained average detection rates of 96.6\%, 96.2\%, 98.5\%, and 93.6\% respectively.},

abstract = {Driver maneuver identification (DMI), i.e., the task of predicting the driver maneuver classes given sensor measurements (such as IMU sensors from mobile devices), can serve as a key enabler for many ubiquitous driver behavior analysis applications. Despite the prior studies, two major technical challenges remain before an effective DMI system can be deployed: (i) latent complex maneuver behavior feature relations for accuracy enhancement, and (ii) inconsistency and uncertainty in model adaptation given dynamic data collection settings (e.g., given different urban environments, drivers, and mobile devices). To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose MetaDMI, a novel and adaptive driver maneuver identification framework based on multi-representation learning and meta model update, with the case study on the inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor measurements (i.e., accelerometer and gyroscope). Specifically, we first extract multiple feature representations for each driver maneuver record in the forms of graph, spectral, and time sequence. Next, MetaDMI processes them with a novel multi-representation learning network, extracting complex patterns and feature relations from the driver maneuvers. Finally, to further enhance the adaptivity of our DMI model to external impacts with dynamic data collection, we have designed a regularized meta learning-based training method to regularize the knowledge transfers across the source and target datasets (e.g., across cities/devices, and few-shot initialization) for consistent and robust identification performance. We have conducted extensive experimental studies upon our MetaDMI prototype based on two datasets (one is collected on our own) and shown that our approach outperforms other baseline approaches for DMI in terms of accuracy and adaptivity.},

abstract = {This paper presents EarIO, an AI-powered acoustic sensing technology that allows an earable (e.g., earphone) to continuously track facial expressions using two pairs of microphone and speaker (one on each side), which are widely available in commodity earphones. It emits acoustic signals from a speaker on an earable towards the face. Depending on facial expressions, the muscles, tissues, and skin around the ear would deform differently, resulting in unique echo profiles in the reflected signals captured by an on-device microphone. These received acoustic signals are processed and learned by a customized deep learning pipeline to continuously infer the full facial expressions represented by 52 parameters captured using a TruthDepth camera. Compared to similar technologies, it has significantly lower power consumption, as it can sample at 86 Hz with a power signature of 154 mW. A user study with 16 participants under three different scenarios, showed that EarIO can reliably estimate the detailed facial movements when the participants were sitting, walking or after remounting the device. Based on the encouraging results, we further discuss the potential opportunities and challenges on applying EarIO on future ear-mounted wearables.},

abstract = {Fuzzing is one of the most effective approaches to finding software flaws. However, applying it to microcontroller firmware incurs many challenges. For example, rehosting-based solutions cannot accurately model peripheral behaviors and thus cannot be used to fuzz the corresponding driver code. In this work, we present μAFL, a hardware-in-the-loop approach to fuzzing microcontroller firmware. It leverages debugging tools in existing embedded system development to construct an AFL-compatible fuzzing framework. Specifically, we use the debug dongle to bridge the fuzzing environment on the PC and the target firmware on the microcontroller device. To collect code coverage information without costly code instrumentation, μAFL relies on the ARM ETM hardware debugging feature, which transparently collects the instruction trace and streams the results to the PC. However, the raw ETM data is obscure and needs enormous computing resources to recover the actual instruction flow. We therefore propose an alternative representation of code coverage, which retains the same path sensitivity as the original AFL algorithm, but can directly work on the raw ETM data without matching them with disassembled instructions. To further reduce the workload, we use the DWT hardware feature to selectively collect runtime information of interest. We evaluated μAFL on two real evaluation boards from two major vendors: NXP and STMicroelectronics. With our prototype, we discovered ten zero-day bugs in the driver code shipped with the SDK of STMicroelectronics and three zero-day bugs in the SDK of NXP. Eight CVEs have been allocated for them. Considering the wide adoption of vendor SDKs in real products, our results are alarming.},

The fundamental problem of determining the robustness of a DNN with respect to its energy consumption (energy robustness) is relatively unexplored compared to accuracy-based robustness. This work investigates the energy robustness of Adaptive Neural Networks (AdNNs), a type of energy-saving DNNs proposed for many energy-sensitive domains and have recently gained traction. We propose EREBA, the first black-box testing method for determining the energy robustness of an AdNN. EREBA explores and infers the relationship between inputs and the energy consumption of AdNNs to generate energy surging samples. Extensive implementation and evaluation using three state-of-the-art AdNNs demonstrate that test inputs generated by EREBA could degrade the performance of the system substantially. The test inputs generated by EREBA can increase the energy consumption of AdNNs by 2,000\% compared to the original inputs. Our results also show that test inputs generated via EREBA are valuable in detecting energy surging inputs.},

abstract = {Many people with dementia residing in long-term care may face barriers in accessing experiences beyond their physical premises; this may be due to location, mobility constraints, legal act and/or mental health restrictions. Previous research has suggested that institutionalization increases the co-existing symptoms of dementia, such as aggression, depression, apathy, lack of motivation and loss of interest in oneself and others. Despite the importance of supporting the mental well-being of people with dementia, in many cases, it remains undertreated. In recent years, there has been growing research interest in designing non-pharmacological interventions aiming to improve the Health-Related Quality of Life for people with dementia within long-term care. With computer technology and especially Virtual Reality offering endless opportunities for mental support, we must consider how Virtual Reality for people with dementia can be sensitively designed to provide comfortable, enriching out-world experiences. Working closely with 24 dementia patients and 51 medical and paramedical personnel, we co-designed an intelligent and personalized Virtual Reality system to enhance symptom management of dementia patients residing in long-term care. Through this paper, we thoroughly explain the screening process and analysis we run to identify which environments patients would like to receive as a Virtual Reality intervention to minimize the aforementioned co-existing symptoms of dementia, and the development of an intelligent system using the selected environments, that adapts the content of the Virtual Reality experience based on physiological and eye-tracking data from the patients and their personal preferences.},

abstract = {Sense of agency (SoA) is the subjective experience that one’s own volitional action caused an event to happen. This experience has cast light to understanding fundamental aspects of human behavior, which includes regulating actions during goal pursuit. Due to its many facets, investigating SoA has proved to be a strong challenge, compelling theorists and experimentalists to develop various paradigms to analyze it. While investigations on SoA have primarily focused on simple tasks that probe basic self-agency capacity awareness, and were carried out mostly under controlled laboratory settings over short experiment durations, we investigated this feeling of control in a complex, natural setting where participants performed daily their goal-directed tasks. More importantly, however, we investigated the SoA construct in a multidimensional way, i.e., simultaneously investigating its pre-reflective and reflective, local and general, and dynamic nature, as well as how individual differences moderated its influence on goal pursuit. We collected over 5,000 data points from 43 participants on their daily perceptions of self-agency and pursuance of healthy eating for more than a month outside the confines of a lab using a smartphone app that we designed. We present our analyses and insights that emerged from our empirical results on how the many facets of SoA impacted in various ways the pursuance of the goal. To our knowledge, we are the first to study the SoA construct in this manner, and we posit our method can be used for an intelligent system to enhance a human counterpart’s SoA for self-driven persuasion to follow through the goal.},

abstract = {Mobile devices are augmented with advanced computing and sensing capabilities. Due to mobility, they are surrounded by dynamically changing environmental conditions. The immense context information flowing from their environment has paved the way for improved user experience. As users are central to the mobile computing paradigm, context information typically contains sensitive personal data, including user location. Users may need varying levels of privacy at different places and times. Since, as human beings, we are not capable of handling continuously flowing data, it is essential to automatically configure device privacy settings across changing contexts. In this paper, we propose a Context-Adaptive and Personalized Privacy-Preserving System (CAPPPS). It adapts to the changes in location, date, and time as the user context. The system adjusts privacy parameters for mobile device location concerning user privacy requirements while using a location-based system (LBS). We adopt a differential privacy approach to perturb user locations. We evaluated the effectiveness of CAPPPS using actual user trajectories. Results show that CAPPPS is effective for providing adaptive and personalized location privacy based on privacy parameters for changing user context.},

abstract = {Developing countries are home to the most polluted cities in the world. Particulate Matter (PM), one of the most serious air pollutants, needs to be measured at scale across urban areas in such countries. Factors potentially affecting PM like road traffic, green cover, industrial emissions etc., also need to be quantified, to enable fine-grained correlation analyses among PM and its causes. This paper presents an IoT platform with multiple sensors, latest deep neural network based edge-computing, local storage and communication support – to measure PM and its associated factors. Through real world deployments, the first in depth empirical analysis of a government enforced traffic control policy for pollution control, is presented as a use case of our IoT platform. We demonstrate the potential of IoT and edge computing in urban sustainability questions in this paper, especially in a developing region context. At the same time, we show how complex a real system like Particulate Matter’s factor analyses can be, and urge environmentalists to use sensors networks and fine-grained empirical datasets as ours in future, for more nuanced and data-driven policy discussions.},

abstract = {Low-latency I/O services are essential for latency-sensitive workloads when they co-run with throughput-oriented workloads in cloud data centers. Although advanced SSDs such as Intel Optane SSDs can offer ultra-low latency at the device layer, I/O interference among various workloads through the I/O stack can still significantly enlarge I/O latency. It is still an open problem to best utilize ultra-low latency SSDs in cloud computing environments.In this paper, we analyze the entire I/O stack and reveal that I/O interference is mainly attributed to resource contention in the SSD device, transactions commit in the file system, and costly process scheduling. To address these problems, we propose FastResponse, a holistic approach to use ultra-low latency SSDs for latency-sensitive workloads. First, we propose a new I/O scheduler at the block layer to throttle I/O requests of throughput-oriented workloads, and thus reduce the resource contention in the SSD device. Second, we develop a fine-grained journaling scheme to reduce the latency of transaction at the file system layer. Third, we redesign Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) to promote the priority of latency-sensitive processes. We implement FastResponse in Linux kernel and evaluate it with several mixed workloads. Compared with the vanilla Linux and the state-of-the-art SelectISR, FastResponse can reduce the average response time of latency-sensitive workloads by 18--70\% and 10--67\%, respectively, and reduce the 99.9th percentile response time by 58--80\% and 52--78\%, respectively. Meanwhile, the performance degradation for throughput-oriented workloads is less than 6\%.},

abstract = {The application of reinforcement learning to the optimal control of building systems has gained traction in recent years as it can cut the building energy consumption and improve human comfort. Despite using sample-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms, most related work requires several months of sensor data and operational parameters of the building to train an agent that outperforms existing rule-based controllers in a large multi-zone building. Moreover, exploring the large state and action spaces can result in poor indoor environmental quality for occupants. In this paper, we propose to reduce the training cost of a policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm by learning a library of control policies on a training building and taking advantage of both environmental and policy diversity. To transfer these policies to a target building, which can be different from the training building, we develop a simple method to assign the best pretrained policy in the library to each zone of the target building. We show that even without retraining the transferred policies on the target building, they can reduce the HVAC energy consumption by 40.4\% compared to a fixed-schedule baseline and by 48.97\% compared to agents trained on the target building for 5,000 months. The plausibility of our results underscores the importance of using diversity and transfer learning in multi-agent reinforcement learning settings and could pave the way for the adoption of reinforcement-learning based controllers in real buildings.},

abstract = {The growth of smart devices is making typical homes more intelligent. In this work, in collaboration with therapists, we introduce a home-based AI therapist that takes advantage of the smart home environment to screen the day-to-day functioning and infer mental wellness of an occupant. Unlike existing “chatbot” works that identify the mental status of users through conversation, our AI therapist additionally leverages smart devices and sensors throughout the home to infer mental well-being and assesses a user's daily functioning. We propose a series of 37 dimensions of daily functioning, that our system observes through conversing with the user and detecting daily activity events using sensors and smart sensors throughout the home. Our system utilizes these 37 dimensions in conjunction with novel natural language processing architectures to detect abnormalities in mental status (e.g., angry or depressed), well-being, and daily functioning and generate responses to console users when abnormalities are detected. Through a series of user studies, we demonstrate that our system can converse with a user naturally, accurately detect abnormalities in well-being, and provide appropriate responses consoling users.},

abstract = {Wearable devices have been widely utilized by the general public for tracking physical activities. Many complex machine learning models leverage wearable devices to address application problems, such as predicting pedestrian behaviors and health management. These models often incur heavy computing load and energy cost, which is challenging for wearable devices. However, aggregating the data from different wearable devices to a central server introduces privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose an architecture, CloudyFL, by deploying cloudlets close to wearable devices. In CloudyFL, each cloudlet forms a trusted zone covering a subset of nearby wearable devices. Models are trained in this trusted zone, and then, only the model parameters are transmitted to a centralized aggregator using a federated learning framework. We additionally propose an LSTM-based model for user behavior sensing, with a neural network design to adjust to the non-IID data distribution on multiple cloudlets. Experimental results show that our training model within the CloudyFL architecture can achieve a performance better than existing methodologies.},

abstract = {Recognising and monitoring emotional states play a crucial role in mental health and well-being management. Importantly, with the widespread adoption of smart mobile and wearable devices, it has become easier to collect long-term and granular emotion-related physiological data passively, continuously, and remotely. This creates new opportunities to help individuals manage their emotions and well-being in a less intrusive manner using off-the-shelf low-cost devices. Pervasive emotion recognition based on physiological signals is, however, still challenging due to the difficulty to efficiently extract high-order correlations between physiological signals and users' emotional states. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end emotion recognition system based on a convolution-augmented transformer architecture. Specifically, it can recognise users' emotions on the dimensions of arousal and valence by learning both the global and local fine-grained associations and dependencies within and across multimodal physiological data (including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, heart rate, and skin temperature). We extensively evaluated the performance of our model using the K-EmoCon dataset, which is acquired in naturalistic conversations using off-the-shelf devices and contains spontaneous emotion data. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baselines and achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance. We also demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our system on another affective dataset which used affect inducement and commercial physiological sensors.},

We propose an unsupervised representation learning method that yields low-dimensional latent state descriptors, that mitigates the sensitivity to perceptual aliasing, and works on power-efficient, embedded hardware.

Drones operating BVLOS include a variety of highly sensitive assets and information that could be subject to unintentional or intentional security vulnerabilities. As a solution, blockchain-based services could enable secure and trustworthy exchange and storage of related data. They also allow for traceability of exchanges and synchronization with other nodes in the network. In this context, we develop simulation models to evaluate different blockchain-based solutions before implementing them in real systems. However, most of these blockchain-based approaches focus on the network and the protocol aspects of drone systems. Few studies focus on the architectural level of on-chip compute platforms of drones. Based on this observation, the contribution of this paper is twofold : (1) a generic blockchain-based service architecture for on-chip compute platforms of drones in a simulated environment, and (2) an illustration of the proposed generic architecture in a simulated environment for authentication.},

We designed a hardware accelerator, called an Intelligence Boost Engine (IBE), for low-power smart edge devices to enable the real-time processing of emerging intelligent applications with energy efficiency and limited programmability. The measurement results confirm that the proposed IBE can reduce the power consumption of the edge node device by 75\% and achieve performance improvement in processing the kernel operations of applications such as motion recognition by 69.9 times.},

However, existing iteration based signal recovery methods have high latency, while the deep learning based method have a shortcoming that large increase in parameters makes training more difficult as the signal length increases. In this paper, we combine compressed sensing and generative adversarial networks to propose a signal recovery method based on dilated convolution. The proposed model can accept more prior information from compressed long signal without increasing parameters and achieve feature domain self-adaptation by fitting the distribution of reconstructed and original signals. Experiments result on MIT-BIH and PTB datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable or better results in reconstruction accuracy and reconstruction time when compared to some existing iteration-based methods and some deep learning based methods. For example, reconstructing a 2s signal takes only 0.013s, which is a 50\% improvement over other deep learning methods.},

We conducted a study with 16 participants testing the sharing of either heart rate or breathing rate through haptic or audio sensations. Participants experienced these sensations while watching videos of narrators describing personal experiences. We assessed the subjects’ feelings of affiliation and synchrony toward a narrator through surveys, interviews, and correlated physiological data. Our findings show that sensory devices that transfer interoceptive sensations, especially those below the level of conscious perception, can have a positive impact on feelings of connectedness. This has implications for the application of physiological channels in remote interactions to improve social connection.},

While this shift is often approached from a broad ecological level, there is opportunity for a more local shift in understanding our day to day meeting with the material world. Drawing on the posthuman theories of Karen Barad, we explore the creation of a digital interactive system as a material-discursive practice in which matter and culture are inseparably entangled. We seek a fresh look at the process rather than the outcome of interactive system design through a diffractive reading of four traditional woodworking practices and an auto-ethnographic account of the development of a digital sensor and actuator apparatus as a way to find alternative ways of attending to materials in HCI.},

abstract = {We present LedgerView -- a system that adds access control views to permissioned blockchains. The approach is motivated by an AT&amp;T application of tracking refurbished devices. A blockchain is a decentralized tamper-resistant ledger managed by a group of peers. It is used in many applications for storing and sharing sensitive information, e.g., monetary transactions, health records, personal documents, etc. But in blockchain, all the peers see all the stored transactions, while in some applications, access to sensitive information should be limited, that is, concealed from peers and users who do not have proper access permissions. In database management systems, sets of records that are visible to some users and concealed from others are defined by views, but existing blockchain systems lack such access-control capabilities. Thus, in this paper, we introduce access-control views for Hyperledger Fabric. We present two types of views -- irrevocable and revocable, according to whether access to sensitive information can or cannot be revoked. We explain how to implement the two types of view by using cryptographic hash functions and encryption keys, and we show how to support Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Experiments with supply chain transactions illustrate the incurred costs of the views in LedgerView, including latency, transaction rate and storage overhead.},

abstract = {Data privacy and security are currently an important societal topic that rightfully garners much attention. In an effort to make people the owners of their personal data, the Bubl platform will provide its users with a secure personal data vault. This platform will have a focus on medical and healthcare data, because of its sensitive nature. Gathering important insights from users’ data could be useful, but due to the high privacy and security standards required by Bubl, it becomes impossible to deploy standard Machine Learning (ML) techniques. These methods require centralization of all training data, which is not allowed. This problem can be solved using techniques from the research field of Privacy Preserving Machine Learning (PPML). Therefore, a system to facilitate PPML within the Bubl platform is developed. More specifically, we employ a technique called Federated Learning (FL). In our FL implementation in the Bubl platform, we focus on minimizing Random-Access Memory (RAM) usage to adhere to the constraints posed by the small computational budgets of the data vaults. Challenges that arise are non-Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) data and the fact that patient vaults contain very few data samples. The latter is the main focus of this research as it is underdeveloped in the FL literature. Currently, we are still working on acquiring the results which are expected in the coming months. At this moment, only preliminary results are discussed that reflect on the effect of the number of clients and the distribution of non-IID data on the ML performance.},

abstract = {Resource disaggregation has gained much traction as an emerging datacenter architecture, as it improves resource utilization and simplifies hardware adoption. Under resource disaggregation, different types of resources (memory, CPUs, etc.) are disaggregated into dedicated servers connected by high-speed network fabrics. Memory disaggregation brings efficiency challenges to concurrent garbage collection (GC), which is widely used for latency-sensitive cloud applications, because GC and mutator threads simultaneously run and constantly compete for memory and swap resources. Mako is a new concurrent and distributed GC designed for memory-disaggregated environments. Key to Mako’s success is its ability to offload both tracing and evacuation onto memory servers and run these tasks concurrently when the CPU server executes mutator threads. A major challenge is how to let servers efficiently synchronize as they do not share memory. We tackle this challenge with a set of novel techniques centered around the heap indirection table (HIT), where entries provide one-hop indirection for heap pointers. Our evaluation shows that Mako achieves 12 ms at the 90th-percentile pause time and outperforms Shenandoah by an average of 3\texttimes{} in throughput.},

abstract = {Trustworthy sensor data is important for IoT sensing systems. As such, these systems need to guarantee that the sensor data is acquired by the correct device and has not been tampered with. However, IoT sensing systems can be quite complex and are often composed of multiple components, i.e., a main device and subordinate sensors. The main device is responsible for gathering and processing the data from the subordinate sensor and reports the result to a server. In order to guarantee data correctness, we introduce two types of physically unclonable function (PUF): one for the main device and one for the subordinate sensor. The main device has a trusted execution environment (TEE) for critical processing, and the correctness of the TEE is guaranteed by remote attestation based on a PUF. The subordinate sensor sends the sensor data to the main device with a message authentication code (MAC) based on a PUF. We implemented a trusted IoT sensing system using a RISC-V Keystone with a PRINCE Glitch PUF for the main device and a Raspberry Pi that simulates a CMOS image sensor PUF for the subordinate sensor.},

The sense gloves were integrated into Unity and SteamVR for the interaction and motion tracking of virtual objects. To ensure real time interaction when capturing and manipulating virtual objects, effective communication was required between the designed objects and layers making up the sense glove.

Examples are machining processes where different tools are used for cutting, shearing, bending etc., but further analysis can be done using vibration sensors or acoustic sensors fitted on the tool or placed on the workbench, not directly connected to it. Such a disjoint scenario would require an integration scheme where data acquisition entities and production objects along with other data sources such as databases can be synchronized and used for effective analysis. This paper proposes the use of a middle-ware entity such as Open Platform Communication Unified Automation (OPC UA) standard as a communication and trigger mechanism for the onset of multiple functions such as device recognition, data acquisition and control switches for these separate devices into a common web service space. The implemented demonstration focuses on the use of custom interoperability solutions as a means to explore the possibility of advanced analyses using sensors and devices not already integrated into the systems, and hence are detachable, portable and reusable as a subsystem to any production floor equipment.},

abstract = {Side-channel attacks that leak sensitive information through a computing device's interaction with its physical environment have proven to be a severe threat to devices' security, particularly when adversaries have unfettered physical access to the device. Traditional approaches for leakage detection measure the physical properties of the device. Hence, they cannot be used during the design process and fail to provide root cause analysis. An alternative approach that is gaining traction is to automate leakage detection by modeling the device. The demand to understand the scope, benefits, and limitations of the proposed tools intensifies with the increase in the number of proposals. In this SoK, we classify approaches to automated leakage detection based on the model's source of truth. We classify the existing tools on two main parameters: whether the model includes measurements from a concrete device and the abstraction level of the device specification used for constructing the model. We survey the proposed tools to determine the current knowledge level across the domain and identify open problems. In particular, we highlight the absence of evaluation methodologies and metrics that would compare proposals' effectiveness from across the domain. We believe that our results help practitioners who want to use automated leakage detection and researchers interested in advancing the knowledge and improving automated leakage detection.},

To manage the data collected and sampled by medical devices, traditional centralized data management will lead to attacks such as single point of failure, which pose a security threat. Aiming at the problems of low data trust and uncontrolled data sharing in telemedicine, we proposed blockchain-based secure medical data management and disease prediction. To securely manage healthcare data, we carefully designed three-tier architecture. Specifically, in the user sensor layer, medical sensors monitor the patient status in real-time. In the storage layer, to protect the privacy of patients, we stored their data in blocks and quantified the medical data by using information entropy technology. In addition, in the blockchain layer, we also used smart contracts for application, authorization, and access control of health data to eliminate privacy leaks caused by internal and external security risks. The information summary is recorded on the blockchain to ensure the integrity of backtracking and anti-repudiation. We designed an extensible machine learning algorithm to predict disease types using a disease prediction model algorithm based on transfer learning. Security analysis and numerical results showed that the proposed scheme can effectively manage the safety data of telemedicine and predict the patient's future condition.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of cloud computing, an increasing number of companies are adopting cloud storage technology to reduce overhead. However, to ensure the privacy of sensitive data, the uploaded data need to be encrypted before being outsourced to the cloud. The concept of public-key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) was introduced by Boneh et al. to provide flexible usage of the encrypted data. Unfortunately, most of the PEKS schemes are not secure against inside keyword guessing attacks (IKGA), so the keyword information of the trapdoor may be leaked to the adversary. To solve this issue, Huang and Li presented public key authenticated encryption with keyword search (PAEKS) in which the trapdoor generated by the receiver is only valid for authenticated ciphertexts. With their seminal work, many PAEKS schemes have been introduced for the enhanced security of PAEKS. Some of them further consider the upcoming quantum attacks. However, our cryptanalysis indicated that in fact, these schemes could not withstand IKGA. To fight against the attacks from quantum adversaries and support the privacy-preserving search functionality, we first introduce a novel generic PAEKS construction in this work. Then, we further present the first quantum-resistant PAEKS instantiation based on lattices. The security proofs show that our instantiation not only satisfies the basic requirements but also achieves enhanced security models, namely the multi-ciphertext indistinguishability and multi-trapdoor privacy. Furthermore, the comparative results indicate that with only some additional expenditure, the proposed instantiation provides more secure properties, making it suitable for more diverse application environments.},

abstract = {The proliferation of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) and the advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have led to explosive digitization of the industrial sector. It offers promising perspectives for high reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety production process, but also makes the systems more complex and challenging for health assessment. To deal with these challenges, one needs to develop a robust approach to monitor and assess the system’s health state. In this article, a practical and effective hybrid deep learning multi-task framework integrating the advantages of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to reflect the relatedness of remaining useful life prediction with health status detection process for complex multi-object systems in CPS environment is developed. The CNN is used as a feature extractor to compress condition monitoring data and directly extract significant spatiotemporal features from raw multi-sensory input data. The LSTM is used to capture long-term temporary dependency features. The advantages of the proposed hybrid deep learning framework have been verified on the popular NASA’s C-MAPSS dataset. The experimental study compares this approach to the existing methods using the same dataset. The results suggest that the proposed hybrid CNN-LSTM model is superior to existing methods, including traditional machine learning and deep learning-based methods. The proposed framework can provide strong support for the health management and maintenance strategy development of complex multi-object systems.},

abstract = {Under the guidance of the National Development and Reform Commission of China, the Ministry of Natural Resources, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the National Energy Administration and other departments responded positively, and finally proposed "green storage" as one of the contents of "green upgrade of infrastructure" in the notice of "Green Industry Guidance Directory". Thus, more and more attention has been paid to energy saving in the storage industry at the national level. In this paper, through reading the domestic and foreign research theories and relevant practical information about intelligent lighting system, we understand the brightness requirements of logistics warehouse for lighting system, and comprehensively consider the operational lighting requirements of logistics warehouse personnel. On how to optimize the normal logistics warehouse space lighting design strategy is put forward, this design with zigbee technology as the core of logistics warehouse wireless lighting control, and through the sensing function of unmanned in warehouse and a period of time without homework personnel to return to the lighting system will automatically enter a dormant state in order to reduce unnecessary power consumption, Achieve the effect of energy saving and environmental protection. This paper hopes to lay a foundation for the improvement of the lighting system of logistics warehousing by optimizing the intelligent lighting system of green warehousing, and make a contribution to the realization of green warehousing as soon as possible.},

abstract = {Smartwatches have the potential to provide glanceable, always-available sound feedback to people who are deaf or hard of hearing (DHH). We present SoundWatch, a smartwatch-based deep learning application to sense, classify, and provide feedback about sounds occurring in the environment. To design SoundWatch, we first examined four low-resource sound classification models across four device architectures: watch-only, watch+phone, watch+phone+cloud, and watch+cloud. We found that the best model, VGG-lite, performed similar to the state of the art for nonportable devices although requiring substantially less memory (∼1/3rd) and that the watch+phone architecture provided the best balance among CPU, memory, network usage, and latency. Based on these results, we built and conducted a lab evaluation of our smartwatch app with eight DHH participants. We found support for our sound classification app but also uncovered concerns with misclassifications, latency, and privacy.},

abstract = {Nosework dogs have important roles in our everyday safety and security, from search and rescue to bomb detection. However, it takes many years for a dog handler to learn to recognize and understand the subtle cues from their canine partner. In this pilot study, we try to bridge the communication gap between nosework dogs and their handlers by developing a wearable device for dogs that collects audio and IMU data fed into machine learning algorithms to classify and predict nosework behaviors. The wearable device we developed uses a cardioid mic and two IMU sensors with the following design goals in mind: (1) dog comfort (2) ease of use for the handler and (3) reducing noise and issues due to the environment. We collected and labeled 20 minutes of audio and IMU data from a nosework dog performing searches while wearing our sensors. In this preliminary phase of the study, we focused our analysis on the audio data only, and we were able to classify sniffing audio events (idle vs sniffing) with 94.4\% accuracy, which is a promising start for future work in this area. Our hope is that this pilot study will provide a proof of concept for more advanced systems that can provide finer granularity of behavior that may, for instance, take into account the sniffing frequency and sequence of movement patterns from the IMU sensors in order to better understand the changes in the dog's behavior while searching.},
