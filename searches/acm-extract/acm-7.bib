abstract = {Buttons are vital in user interfaces, and their tactile qualities significantly influence user experience, yet mechanical versions are often absent from compact and wearable devices due to space constraints. Existing haptic solutions, mainly vibrotactile actuators, lack the spatial resolution to reproduce their nuanced feel. We present ElectroClick, a thin, flexible electrotactile interface that simulates button sensations---such as click, keystroke, frequency, and spatial patterns---linked to pressing force. We address the challenges of rendering fine-grained button feedback, maintaining click reliability alongside other electrotactile cues, and comparing performance with physical buttons. User studies show that parameter adjustments can produce varied, realistic button sensations. Our contributions include the ElectroClick method, hardware and algorithms, design guidelines, and application examples across platforms.},

abstract = {Chronic respiratory conditions such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and asthma often progress insidiously, making early detection vital for effective intervention. Current gold-standard Pulmonary Function Testing (PFT) methods, such as spirometry, evaluate lung function by measuring airflow rates to detect potential obstructions. But, their cost, often several hundred dollars or more, limits their accessibility for regular at-home monitoring. In this paper, we present SpiroSense, a novel system that transforms a smartphone into a portable, low-cost, and accurate PFT device for everyday use by integrating a custom 3D-printed attachment costing just a dozen dollars. However, a critical limitation arises from the smartphone's inherent audio sampling rate (typically 48kHz), which constrains the airflow resolution to 11.9L/s when using conventional cross-correlation-based time delay estimation. This coarse resolution is insufficient to capture key pulmonary metrics, such as a Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) of 10 L/s, with high fidelity. To address this, we propose SonicFlow, which establishes a foundational airflow rate sensing model based on ultrasonic phase features and improves the airflow rate resolution to 0.148L/s. Furthermore, airflow-induced high-frequency harmonic noise within the 3D-printed model, combined with ambient environmental noise, further complicates accurate sensing. To mitigate this, we introduce NoiseClear, an end-to-end ultrasonic signal enhancement model designed to effectively suppress noise while preserving critical airflow velocity information. We prototype SpiroSense and evaluate its performance on a cohort of 59 participants, including 29 healthy individuals and 30 patients. Experimental results show that SpiroSense achieves average estimation error of 6.44\% for Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), 7.42\% for Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1), and 3.01\% for the FEV1/FVC ratio.},

abstract = {Recent work has begun to leverage commercial headphones for ear canal health monitoring. However, existing solutions are limited to detecting coarse abnormalities using single-frequency probe tones and specialized hardware. Detecting fine-grained conditions---such as tympanic membrane retraction---remains a significant challenge due to anatomical variability, the limitations of low-sensitivity microphones, and the uncontrolled nature of real-world audio. We present EarCSI, a reconstruction-driven framework that enables precise ear-canal sensing from passive broadband audio using commodity headphones. The core of our system is a lightweight frequency-domain Channel Reconstruction Module, which models the ear canal geometry by analyzing spectral features such as peak spacing and angular propagation behavior. To achieve this, we design a set of novel estimation techniques, including peak-trough-based coarse length inference, spectral angle-based shortest path estimation, and a reflection-aware transfer matrix model that captures cumulative impedance effects. These methods allow the system to reconstruct user-specific ear canal profiles without per-user training or access to invasive scans. Through modeling and experimentation, we uncover a critical constraint: reliable reconstruction requires signal duration, even for short ear canals. To ensure robustness in daily scenarios, we further introduce signal-level and distribution-level interference mitigation strategies that compensate for background noise, headphone misalignment, nonlinearity, and environmental drift. Ultimately, a low-latency classifier extracts health-related features from the reconstructed frequency response and accurately detects tympanic retraction.EarCSI achieves over 95\% classification accuracy and under 5\% reconstruction error across 88 ears using multiple commercial headphones, operating in real-time (168 ms latency). It enables passive and continuous monitoring of tympanic responses during everyday listening, offering a new pathway for personalized auditory health sensing.},

abstract = {The proliferation of commodity devices for gathering health data has led to multimodal health trackers that provide increasingly holistic views of people's well-being. As these trackers become more complex, it becomes harder for users to interpret how different signals interrelate in order to derive actionable insights and make informed health decisions. Addressing this challenge first requires understanding the cognitive and behavioral processes through which users interpret and make sense of multimodal data. In this paper, we use menstrual health tracking as a case study for investigating how individuals interpret multimodal health data. We conducted a 100-day longitudinal study with 20 participants who used a variety of health trackers to monitor signals relevant to menstrual health (e.g., hormones, sleep, mood). Through surveys and interviews, we identified that participants aligned their health goals with each device's perceived scope and approached multimodal data with hypotheses that involved pairs of signals. Our findings shed light on how a person's confidence in the sensemaking processes shapes their engagement with multimodality, leading to design recommendations that scaffold trust between users and their devices while encouraging exploration and staying true to users' evolving health goals.},

abstract = {Human locomotion is a fundamental aspect of daily life and a critical indicator of overall health. This study proposes a cross-modal learning framework based on inertial measurement units (IMUs) to infer plantar pressure distribution, ground reaction force (GRF), and center of pressure (COP). Traditional methods for pressure measurement rely on expensive and complex laboratory equipment, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. By integrating IMU data with deep learning techniques, this research achieves real-time, cost-effective, and accurate pressure estimation. The proposed method leverages IMU sensors to reconstruct foot pressure distribution in real-time, with high precision and adaptability to individual characteristics. A robust data pipeline and pretrained model enable accurate inference of GRF and COP using minimal IMU data, validated through case studies. Furthermore, The study builds a high-quality training dataset and optimizes the system for lightweight deployment, enhancing suitability for low-resource environments. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach across multiple evaluation metrics, particularly in individual adaptability, spatiotemporal feature capture, and deployment in resource-constrained settings. This work provides a novel and practical solution for clinical gait analysis, sports training, and health monitoring, while paving the way for advanced applications of intelligent devices in motion analysis.},

abstract = {Frequent blood pressure (BP) monitoring is crucial for helping patients and clinicians assess the risk of cardiovascular disease. The current oscillometric method needs to occlude peripheral arteries and the repeated inflation can cause discomfort, leading to reduced compliance. Although several cuffless BP monitoring systems have been proposed, they often either lack sufficient accuracy or impose a significant calibration burden, rendering them impractical. To address this gap, we introduce PracticalBP, a cuffless wrist-worn system that requires only a single BP reading for calibration to achieve accurate BP measurements. We identify the main issue of current cuffless devices is that the key user-specific hemodynamic information cannot be obtained with a low effort. Our key insight is that these individual BP-related information can be obtained effortlessly by physiology-based methods. To facilitate this, we propose a physiology-based pseudo-label generation mechanism to create an individual data distribution based on the principles of tonometry and hydrostatic pressure in arteries. During it, the user only needs to simply stay calm and tilt the arm. Furthermore, we observe that BP-related features exhibit different patterns across individuals. Therefore, we propose an effective feature extraction approach that combines a general feature extractor with a feature-wise attention module to assess the importance of each feature for different subjects. Additionally, in order to improve robustness, we design a channel-based data augmentation mechanism to cope with the signal distortion caused by the sensor position changes during each wear. PracticalBP is implemented in the real system with our developed wristband. We collect a dataset from 25 healthy subjects and 18 hypertension patients and conduct both rest tests and BP intervention experiments. The evaluation demonstrates that PracticalBP achieves an overall systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) estimated error (mean ± standard deviation) of (-1.49 ± 7.89) mmHg and (-0.83 ± 6.23) mmHg, respectively, which meets the requirement of AAMI standard. Notably, our system achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art solutions while reducing the calibration time by a factor of five and eliminating the need for complex BP intervention tasks.},

The top layer comprises conductive fabrics for sensing electrocardiogram (ECG) and surface electromyogram (sEMG), while the bottom layer features pressure-sensitive fabrics to monitor sleep location and movement. The system processes ECG and sEMG signals sequentially to infer multiple sleep variables and incorporates an adversarial neural network to enhance posture classification accuracy. We fabricate prototypes using off-the-shelf hardware and conduct both lab-based and in-the-wild longitudinal user studies to evaluate the system's effectiveness. Across 151 nights and 912.2 hours of real-world sleep data, the system achieves an F1 score of 88\% for classifying seven sleep postures, and clinically-acceptable accuracy in vital sign monitoring.

abstract = {High-quality environment lighting is essential for creating immersive mobile augmented reality (AR) experiences. However, achieving visually coherent estimation for mobile AR is challenging due to several key limitations in AR device sensing capabilities, including low camera FoV and limited pixel dynamic ranges. Recent advancements in generative AI, which can generate high-quality images from different types of prompts, including texts and images, present a potential solution for high-quality lighting estimation. Still, to effectively use generative image diffusion models, we must address two key limitations of content quality and slow inference. In this work, we design and implement a generative lighting estimation system called CleAR that can produce high-quality, diverse environment maps in the format of 360° HDR images. Specifically, we design a two-step generation pipeline guided by AR environment context data to ensure the output aligns with the physical environment's visual context and color appearance. To improve the estimation robustness under different lighting conditions, we design a real-time refinement component to adjust lighting estimation results on AR devices. To train and test our generative models, we curate a large-scale environment lighting estimation dataset with diverse lighting conditions. Through a combination of quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that CleAR outperforms state-of-the-art lighting estimation methods on both estimation accuracy, latency, and robustness, and is rated by 31 participants as producing better renderings for most virtual objects. For example, CleAR achieves 51\% to 56\% accuracy improvement on virtual object renderings across objects of three distinctive types of materials and reflective properties. CleAR produces lighting estimates of comparable or better quality in just 3.2 seconds---over 110X faster than state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, CleAR supports real-time refinement of lighting estimation results, ensuring robust and timely updates for AR applications.},

In this paper, we introduce Grab-n-Go, the first wearable device that leverages active acoustic sensing to recognize subtle hand microgestures while holding various objects. Unlike prior systems that focus solely on free-hand gestures or basic hand-object activity recognition, Grab-n-Go simultaneously captures information about hand microgestures, grasping poses, and object geometries using a single wristband, enabling the recognition of fine-grained hand movements occurring within activities involving occupied hands. A deep learning framework processes these complex signals to identify 30 distinct microgestures, with 6 microgestures for each of the 5 grasping poses.

A follow-up study further validated Grab-n-Go's robustness against 10 more challenging, deformable objects. These results underscore the potential of Grab-n-Go to provide seamless, unobtrusive interactions without requiring modifications to existing objects.

abstract = {With the rapid advancement of wireless technologies, in-air handwriting recognition based on radio frequency (RF) signals emerges as a promising solution for human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often constrain writing gestures to predefined planes, impose strict requirements on writing order and direction, and limit recognition tasks to a small set of digits or letters. To overcome these limitations, we propose m2VLMs, a modality mapping architecture, which serves as a bridge between the millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar sensing technologies and large vision-language models (VLMs). Based on the proposed architecture, a three-dimensional (3D) in-air handwriting word recognition system named mmPencil is developed. Specifically, we design a multi-stage spatial trajectory reconstruction algorithm that extracts frequency-domain features to identify handwriting regions and achieve high-precision reconstruction of 3D word trajectories. Furthermore, we introduce a novel spatial-to-visual mapping algorithm, which bridges the gap between spatial trajectory information captured by mmWave radar and vision-language representations, providing a foundation for cross-modality understanding in the large vision-language model. As a result, mmPencil tackles the limitations of current solutions that are heavily reliant on handwriting styles and environmental factors, expanding RF-based in-air handwriting recognition to more complex word-level scenarios.We collect and release a 3D mmWave handwriting dataset comprising 200 distinct words (ranging from 2 to 9 letters), contributions from 12 users, and 22 different writing scenarios, totaling 7,664 samples with an overall size of 31.66 GB. Extensive experiments demonstrate that mmPencil achieves accurate and robust word recognition in real-world scenarios, remaining unaffected by variations in word categories, length, as well as writing position, range, angle, speed, size, direction, and user movement. Specifically, for 4 seen users, mmPencil achieves a recognition accuracy of approximately 97.60\% across 200 word classes. Moreover, benefiting from the generalization capability of VLMs, the zero-shot recognition accuracy for 4 unseen users can also reach 92.50\% across 50 word classes using training data from only 8 users, which outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.},

We develop a smartphone's accelerometer-based respiration tracking algorithm, eliminating the need for additional wearables.

Additionally, we introduce the first quantitative framework to estimate mindfulness skills---concentration, sensory clarity, and equanimity---based on accelerometer-derived respiration data. We develop and test our algorithms on 261 mindfulness sessions in both controlled and real-world settings. A user study comparing an experimental group receiving biosignal feedback with a control group using a standard app shows that respiration feedback enhances system usability. Our respiration tracking model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.6 breaths per minute, closely aligning with ground truth data, while our mindfulness skill estimation attains F1 scores of 80-84\% in tracking skill progression. By integrating respiration tracking and mindfulness estimation into a commercial app, we demonstrate the potential of smartphone sensors to enhance digital mindfulness training.},

So far, the most widely used device in digital olfaction is the electronic nose, but direct contact with samples limits it applicability for widespread usage. In this paper, we bridge the gap by proposing Digital Olfactory Mucosa (DOM), which utilizes terahertz signals for contactless sensing and classifying odorant molecules by exploiting the molecular absorption properties of terahertz. Unlike recent wireless gas detecting works that focus on major molecules in the air, DOM specifically focuses on the rare odorant molecules in the air, usually less than 1ppm. To meet the challenge, we custom-design a unique signal processing model based on a hybrid neural network that can perform odorant feature sampling and fusion over time-domain and frequency-domain signals, so as to extract rare odorant molecular features. Furthermore, in order to better accommodate the diversity of odors, we design a dual granularity contrastive learning schema to optimize the spatial distribution of extracted olfactory features, which enhances the scalability of DOM.

abstract = {Wireless medical sensor networks can be used to examine patients in healthcare applications, which are well-considered as fascinating domains for WSN. The requirement for constant monitoring of vital bodily functions and assistance with patient mobility is alluring in hospital or extended care settings. Current studies focus on patient mobility, energy-efficient routing, and dependable communication. On the other hand, in healthcare applications it is important to address specific security concerns due to the deployment of novel knowledge, which is vital for the deployment of wireless patient monitoring devices. Wireless sensor networks (WSN) is widely developed in the healthcare domain. Currently, there are a number of applications such as endoscopic capsules, blood pressure monitors and heart rate monitors. Wireless  body area networks, abbreviated to BANs, is a recent challenge that has risen due to the wide use of sensor technologies in this domain. Security and privacy concerns are significant due to the prevalence of wireless devices and their applications. The necessity for personal data collection from individuals or patients raises the risk of privacy violations, particularly as human interaction can amplify sensitivity to these issues.},

abstract = {The impact of nature on human health is of great concern in the twentieth century, especially, pre and post covid duration. Consequently, health information is important for policymakers, medical institutions, and governments for the promotion of social well-being. In this regard, the Earth Observation (EO) data, especially from Sentinel-2 plays a prominent role in various conditions of climate change, floods, and infrastructure development. This information may not represent the entire set of population. So, to maintain the correctness of the remote sensing data, based on the geographical division, various sociodemographic measures are derived from different surveys which are relevant to health, social status, and ethnicity. This work mainly focuses on the potential of the integrated dataset to improve the machine-learning (ML) algorithms in deriving the health outcomes of diverse regions such as anxiety. The various outcomes of the target variables are divided into various categories such as diabetes and hypertension, depression and anxiety, asthma, opioids, and so on. Further, with the outcomes, prescriptions can be anticipated with the combination of the Drug Bank dataset. The second objective is to understand the factors that influence the health outcomes of individuals using multiple data exploratory analysis for predicting anxiety. Finally, this study creates a dataset that addresses the prospective challenges in the field of EO and Artificial Intelligence.

abstract = {Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is powering Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM), which is changing healthcare by letting data be collected, analysed, and decisions made in real time. This essay looks at how IoT-based RPM systems improve care for patients, lower the number of times they have to go back to the hospital, and make the best use of healthcare resources. RPM systems constantly check important health indicators like heart rate, blood pressure, glucose levels, and oxygen saturation by using personal sensors, smart devices, and cloud computing. They send real-time data to healthcare providers. A lot of data about patients is processed by advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms find insights that can be used to take action and predict possible health risks before they become problems. The study focusses on how edge and fog computing can help ensure low-latency data handling, which makes the system more reliable and efficient. Blockchain technology and standardised standards help solve problems like data security, portability, and scaling. This makes patient data more private and helps systems work together better. Case studies show that RPM works well for controlling chronic diseases, recovering from surgery, and caring for the old, showing big changes in patient results and cost saves. In addition, using AI allows for predictive analytics, which makes treatment plans more personalised and gives doctors the power to make decisions based on data.},

Its range of visualization, however, is limited by the length of the stick while surfaces at closer range are better sensed by hands. The availability of sensors may extend the navigation range of assistive devices. In this paper, we describe the design of an assistive device that utilizes ultrasonic sensors in providing both distance and solidity measurements that may enable the visually impaired to better assess their immediate surrounding environment, thereby facilitating ease of navigation and enhanced safety. Experiments in navigating an a 150 meter indoor-outdoor course showed that the device had comparable performance with the white cane (average of 0.75 vs 1.13 collisions per participant, respectively, and a slightly quicker course navigation time (394 vs. 433 seconds). Findings revealed the potential utilization of sensors as a technology-based alternative to white cane in assisting visually impaired individuals estimate the presence and solidity of objects that may be obstructing their path.},

abstract = {The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is profoundly transforming the training, competition strategies, and overall athletic performance of professional athletes. With the widespread application of AI technology, the path to success for professional athletes is undergoing unprecedented changes. AI provides athletes with more precise and personalized training programs through data analysis and prediction. Utilizing advanced sensors and wearable devices, AI can monitor athletes' physiological indicators, movement patterns, and athletic performance in real-time, thereby tailoring training plans for them. This personalized training approach not only improves training efficiency but also helps avoid overtraining and injury risks, laying a solid foundation for athletes' long-term success. In terms of competition strategies, AI analyzes historical data and opponent intelligence to provide scientific decision support for coaching teams. This aids athletes in better coping with various situations in competitions, enhancing their athletic performance. Additionally, AI can simulate competition scenarios, helping athletes engage in targeted training to improve their actual combat abilities. Furthermore, AI plays a significant role in athletes' physical recovery and psychological adjustment. By monitoring athletes' sleep quality, muscle fatigue levels, and other factors through intelligent devices, AI can provide scientific recovery suggestions to accelerate their physical and mental recovery. In summary, artificial intelligence has a profound impact on the success of professional athletes. It not only enhances training efficiency and the scientific nature of competition strategies but also provides strong support for athletes' physical recovery and psychological adjustment. In the future, with the continuous advancement of AI technology, we have reason to believe that professional athletes' athletic performance will reach unprecedented heights. We take Tennis as an example, established a GBP-radar judgment AI model, which combined with radar chart and GBP score model which is accumulated with base score, hold score, break score and score in a raw. The higher the GBP score, the better the performance. And the GBP score results of both players are calculated on a per set basis. Bringing the data of the 2023-wimbledon-1701 match, we found out that Carlos Alcaraz had a higher GBP score in the second set, the third set and the fifth set, and performed better, which is closely matched with the actual win/loss results, as well as plotted a radar chart to analyze the degree of good performance of the players who performed well.},

abstract = {In recent years, with the acceleration of the aging process in China, the normalization of chronic diseases, and the increasing demand for “Internet + Healthcare” services, the combination of wireless communication technology and electronic sensor technology in the field of healthcare has attracted more and more attention. This field not only contains great commercial potential, but also has important scientific research value. In wireless body area network (WBAN) data security research, traditional encryption algorithms have problems in WBAN applicability. Its high computational complexity consumes a lot of energy and computational resources, which leads to the shortening of node life; the encryption and decryption time is long, which cannot meet the real-time requirements. Moreover, early research focused on a single security mechanism, ignoring the complex security requirements, and some of the programs are difficult to land. This paper combines biometric encryption with ECC algorithm. Utilizing the uniqueness of biometrics and the advantages of ECC algorithm for resource-constrained environments, a dual encryption mechanism is constructed, where biometric encryption is used as the initial processing, and then ECC is used as the secondary encryption, which improves security. At the same time, it reduces resource consumption, extends node life, and has good scalability and compatibility, and can be integrated with existing architecture devices.},

However, traditional artificial Moschus berezovskii breeding relies on empirical management, and there are problems such as frequent occurrence of diseases resulting in low production efficiency . In recent years, Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been widely utilized in animal husbandry, and its application in animal husbandry provides a new technical route for the intelligent transformation of Moschus berezovskii breeding. In this paper, a set of intelligent Moschus berezovskii breeding management system with voice control capability based on Niagara framework is designed and realized by combining the current situation of forest musk breeding in Feng County, Baoji City, Shaanxi Province. For the first time, the system combines the hardware of voice interaction control with Niagara framework, monitors the environmental parameters of the enclosure in real time through multiple sensors, and utilizes the edge calculator and voice controller to control the operation of the equipment collaboratively, which realizes the functions of accurate monitoring of the environment of the enclosure as well as the automatic adjustment of the environmental parameters in the enclosure. The simulated data show that the system significantly improves the accuracy of the user's monitoring of the environmental data of the enclosure, makes the daily feeding of Moschus berezovskii more convenient, and provides a technical route for the digital transformation of the breeding of Muschus berezovskii.},

While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown better results in several remote sensing tasks, they are unable to capture long-range dependencies and global spatial relationships. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become popular because they can represent local and global features more accurately. However, ViTs face challenges such as spatial information handling and overfitting. We propose a ViT-based architecture integrating hierarchical feature extraction and spatial encoding to improve the performance of the remote sensing scene classification. Additionally, we systematically analyze dropout regularization at critical layers—patch embedding, spatial encoding, and multi-head attention—to mitigate overfitting. The proposed approach is evaluated on two public datasets—NWPU-RESISC45 and UCM. Experimental results shows our methods are effectiveness in remote sensing image classification.},

abstract = {The unrelenting growth in the memory demands of datacenter applications, combined with DRAM’s volatile prices and ever-increasing costs, has made DRAM a major infrastructure expense. Alternative technologies, such as NVMe SSDs and emerging NVM devices, offer higher capacity than DRAM at a fraction of the cost and power. A promising approach is to transparently offload colder memory to cheaper memory technologies via kernel or hypervisor techniques. The key challenge, however, is to develop a datacenter-scale solution that is robust in dealing with diverse workloads and large performance variance of different offload devices, such as compressed memory, SSD, and NVM. This paper presents TMO, Meta’s transparent memory offloading solution for heterogeneous datacenter environments. TMO introduces a new Linux kernel mechanism that directly measures, in realtime, process stalls due to resource shortages across CPU, memory, and I/O. Guided by this information and without any prior application knowledge, TMO automatically adjusts how much memory to offload to heterogeneous devices (e.g., compressed memory or SSD) according to the device’s performance characteristics and the application’s sensitivity to memory-access slowdown. To maximize memory savings, TMO targets both anonymous memory and file cache, balancing the swap-in rate of anonymous memory and the reload rate of file pages that were recently evicted from the file cache. Moreover, it identifies offloading opportunities not only from the application containers but also from the sidecar containers that provide infrastructure-level functions. TMO has been in production since 2021, saving 20–32\% of total memory across millions of servers in our hyperscale datacenter fleet. We have successfully upstreamed TMO into the Linux kernel.},

abstract = {Real-world decision-making problems often exhibit partial observability, shifting dynamics, and potentially high-stakes outcomes. In Internet of Things (IoT) deployments, these issues become even more pronounced due to noisy sensor data, intermittent connectivity, and the sheer scale of distributed devices. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods may fail to safely generalize in these environments because they rely on correlational patterns rather than causal mechanisms. In this work, we propose a novel Causally-Aware Safe Reinforcement Learning (CAS-RL) framework that integrates causal structure learning with robust policy optimization. Our approach discovers latent causal factors and enforces safety constraints at every decision step, resulting in policies that are more interpretable, safer under distribution shifts, and scalable to long-horizon tasks. Empirical results on both synthetic benchmarks and a healthcare-oriented partially observable domain show that CAS-RL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of robustness, safety compliance, and sample efficiency.},

abstract = {Sleep bruxism (SB) is a sleep-related movement disorder characterized by involuntary masticatory muscle activities during sleep, which may lead to tooth wear, temporomandibular joint disorders, and orofacial pain. Although polysomnography (PSG) is the diagnostic gold standard, its high cost and complexity limit its accessibility. Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have enabled wearable, intelligent, and non-invasive solutions for remote SB detection and personalized treatment. This paper reviews the current progress in AI-based SB diagnosis and therapy. We present an overview of machine learning models such as Convolutional Neural Network (SVM), Support Vector Machine (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) applied to electroencephalogram (EMG), electromyogram (EEG), and audio signals, and compare their suitability for real-time edge computing using Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML). A system architecture integrating wearable sensors, wireless transmission, and cloud or edge AI modules is proposed for automated SB monitoring. In terms of treatment, we highlight AI-driven approaches including adaptive biofeedback systems, emotion-aware cognitive-behavioral therapy, and model-informed precision dosing.},

abstract = {Human Activity Recognition (HAR) stands as a pivotal technique in the pattern recognition community, devoted to deciphering human movements and actions by one or multiple sensory inputs. Given the ubiquitous and unobtrusive nature of WiFi signals, the use of Channel State Information (CSI) for invisible HAR perception has recently emerged as a significant research focus. In this paper, we introduce a attentional multi-scale dilated convolutional network(AMDCN) designed to facilitate non-line-of-sight WiFi-only action sensing from coarse to fine granularity by capturing continuous action sequences with corresponding localization across temporal and spatial streams. Acknowledging that the efficacy of WiFi signals can be significantly affected by environmental changes and varies across different sub-carriers, we develop an Action Temporal Decoder (ATD) aimed at interpreting actions based on contextual information derived from temporal channels. Furthermore, we construct an Action Spatial Decoder (ASD) tasked with identifying action positions informed by context from spatial channels. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations have been conducted to validate our proposed methodologies.},

abstract = {The widespread application of chemical fertilizers and broad-spectrum pesticides has also led to soil erosion, nutrient loss, and agricultural productivity has continued to decline, meeting the economic needs of single-handedly formed large fields. To reveal the dynamics of such agroecosystems, a set of coupled nonlinear differential equation systems were introduced, integrating the interactions of microorganisms in the soil substrate in the primary producers (the so-called primary consumers of the crops (another insect trainer ally of the grass pests) and the soil substrate. This model reflects the stability of local and landscape scales through embedding parameters, reflecting the competition for light, water, nutrients and the functional response of enslaved prey. Clear indications of marginal habitats provide further insight into how fragmented habitats can facilitate the re-establishment of native flora and fauna, thereby enhancing the ability of ecosystems to recover disturbed habitats that have already been broken. Through branch analysis and sensitivity testing, the framework identifies strategies to optimize biodiversity enrichment and natural enemy release rates to maximise crop yields while preserving ecosystem integrity. These achievements provide a solid quantitative foundation for the agricultural system, which balances productivity and long-term ecological health.},

abstract = {The agricultural system in the mountainous areas of North China is rather complex. Here, there exists the phenomenon of fragmented cultivated land and various ecological conflict situations. Therefore, this study proposes a dynamic farming planning model of multiple plot types, hoping to achieve the synergistic improvement effect of the farming plan in terms of time and space from 2024 to 2030. This model comprehensively considers the different characteristics of the plots, involving types such as flat dry land, terraced fields, irrigated land and intelligent greenhouses. Moreover, it combines the requirements of the three-year rotation period of leguminous crops and the restriction of not allowing continuous cropping, thereby forming a decision-making model relying on 0-1 integer programming. The mixed solution was carried out using MATLAB and Python and spatial visualization processing was performed. The research results show that due to the off-season production of the intelligent greenhouse and the traditional open-air plots forming a complementary collaborative mechanism in time, the total revenue of the system expanded to 227,842.5 yuan, which was 8.8\% higher than the average distribution scheme. Moreover, the dynamic rotation strategy of leguminous crops has significantly reduced the application of chemical fertilizers by 15\%, which effectively confirms the technical approach that can simultaneously improve ecological and economic benefits. This model innovatively combines the spatio-temporal allocation mechanism of facility agriculture with the comprehensive plot constraint system, breaking through the technical bottlenecks such as the shortage in quantifying the spatial heterogeneity of plots and the lack of combination of dynamic crop rotation sequences in the existing agricultural planning models. It creates an extensible farming decision-making framework for resource-constrained areas. To promote the advancement of climate-smart agriculture and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, future research will employ dynamic market response mechanisms and integrate remote sensing monitoring and Internet of Things data streams to enhance the stability of models when making decisions in non-steady-state environments.},

abstract = {Industrial Control Systems (ICS) manage critical infrastructures like power grids and water treatment plants. Cyberattacks on ICSs can disrupt operations, causing severe economic, environmental, and safety issues. For example, undetected pollution in a water plant can put the lives of thousands at stake. ICS researchers have increasingly turned to honeypots---decoy systems designed to attract attackers, study their behaviors, and eventually improve defensive mechanisms. However, existing ICS honeypots struggle to replicate the ICS physical process, making them susceptible to detection. Accurately simulating the noise in ICS physical processes is challenging because different factors produce it, including sensor imperfections and external interferences.In this paper, we propose SimProcess, a novel framework to rank the fidelity of ICS simulations by evaluating how closely they resemble real-world and noisy physical processes. It measures the simulation distance from a target system by estimating the noise distribution with machine learning models like Random Forest. Unlike existing solutions that require detailed mathematical models or are limited to simple systems, SimProcess operates with only a timeseries of measurements from the real system, making it applicable to a broader range of complex dynamic systems. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through a case study using real-world power grid data from the EPIC testbed. We compare the performance of various simulation methods, including static and generative noise techniques. Our model correctly classifies real samples with a recall of up to 1.0. It also identifies Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture as the best distribution to simulate our power systems, together with a generative solution provided by an autoencoder, thereby helping developers to improve honeypot fidelity. Additionally, we make our code, dataset, and experimental results publicly available to foster research and collaboration.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the current hot global topic-Overtourism, which has become one of the greatest challenges facing many international tourist cities. Aimed at the sustainable development of Juneau, Alaska, a multi-objective program model with the maximum economic benefit and the minimum social cost and environmental damage realized the purpose of sustainable tourism is constructed based on NSGAII intelligent optimizing algorithm, and takes the number of tourists in Juneau, the proportion of tourists in rainforest areas, the amount spent by each visitor, and the contribution ratio of tax revenue used for building and environment construction as decision variables. The research results show that when Juneau expects to achieve sustainable tourism, the total number of visitors should be 12335, of which about 49.54\% will go to the rainforest; For tourists, the average amount of money they spend every day should be $512.45; Among the tax collected from tourists' consumption, only 27.54\% of the money received should be used to build and protect the environment. Through sensitive experiments, it is found that the increase of tourists has the greatest impact on social cost, and the share of the proportion of tourists entering the rainforest has a greater impact on the degree of damage to the environment. At the same time, in order to further verify the adaptability and effect of the above model under other situations, an experiment was carried out on another famous touristic city-Venice, and the original parameters and formular of the previous model were adjusted according to the characteristics of this area, so as to obtain an effective solution for the overtourism of Venetian.},

abstract = {Juneau, Alaska, USA is an important tourist city. Along with the growth of the number of tourists, the development of local tourism has created certain problems. There is an urgent need to carry out sustainable development and nature protection for local tourism. Therefore, it is of great significance to establish a sustainable mathematical model of tourism and predict the local economic returns, adjust the relevant factors, and give the corresponding optimization scheme. In this study, a multi-objective dynamic planning model is established to integrate the elements of tourism economic returns, tourist scale, environmental quality, and construction investment. Based on the instantaneous prediction technology of state vector, the state transition equation is constructed with the constraints of tourist volume, profit and ticket price. The analytic hierarchy process-entropy weight combination method is used to determine the weight of factors and predict the evolution trend of the system in the future years. The sensitivity analysis is carried out by combining with Monte Carlo algorithm to assess the impact of fluctuations of key parameters on the stability of the system, to reduce the deviation between theoretical prediction and actual demand effectively.},

abstract = {With the rapid growth of global tourism, some cities face challenges in balancing economic benefits, environmental protection, and social stability. This study develops a self-adaptive multi-objective optimization model to help govern- ments achieve sustainable tourism development. Taking Juneau (USA) as case studies, a four- dimensional evaluation system covering economic revenue, carbon emissions, infrastructure pressure, and resident satisfaction was constructed. The model integrates a feedback mechanism and genetic algorithm for iterative optimization. Results show that Juneau achieves optimal balance at 8,200 tourists with an expenditure ratio of 1:5:4. Sensitivity analysis identifies economic and resident satisfaction weights as primary determinants, while carbon emissions and infrastructure pressure act as negative factors.Extended applications include dynamic weight adjustment and pricing strategies for undervisited attractions. Projections based on Juneau's statistical data indicate that without intervention, tourist volume will reach 3.75 million in five years, accompanied by 20\% higher carbon emissions and 10\% lower resident satisfaction. The proposed model provides a flexible, self-regulating framework for policy-makers to optimize visitor management and investment allocation, offering significant strategic value for sustainable urban tourism development.},

abstract = {Since the selection of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization algorithms, research on integrating PQC into security protocols such as TLS/SSL, IPSec, and DNSSEC has been actively pursued. However, PQC migration for Internet of Things (IoT) communication protocols remains largely unexplored. Embedded devices in IoT environments have limited computational power and memory, making it crucial to optimize PQC algorithms for efficient computation and minimal memory usage when deploying them on low-spec IoT devices. In this paper, we introduce KEM-MQTT, a lightweight and efficient Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) for the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, widely used in IoT environments. Our approach applies the NIST KEM algorithm Crystals-Kyber (Kyber) while leveraging MQTT’s characteristics and sensor node constraints. To enhance efficiency, we address certificate verification issues and adopt KEMTLS&nbsp;[72] to eliminate the need for Post-Quantum Digital Signatures Algorithm (PQC-DSA) in mutual authentication. As a result, KEM-MQTT retains its lightweight properties while maintaining the security guarantees of TLS 1.3. We identify inefficiencies in existing Kyber implementations on 8-bit AVR microcontrollers (MCUs), which are highly resource-constrained. To address this, we propose novel implementation techniques that optimize Kyber for AVR, focusing on high-speed execution, reduced memory consumption, and secure implementation, including Signed LookUp-Table (LUT) Reduction. Our optimized Kyber achieves performance gains of 81\%,75\%, and 85\% in the KeyGen, Encaps, and DeCaps processes, respectively, compared to the reference implementation. With approximately 3 KB of stack usage, our Kyber implementation surpasses all state-of-the-art Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) implementations. Finally, in KEM-MQTT using Kyber-512, an 8-bit AVR device completes the handshake preparation process in 4.32 seconds, excluding the physical transmission and reception times.},

abstract = {While gaze data brings benefits like allowing hands-free interaction, it can also reveal sensitive information about people, such as their gender, age, and geographical origin. Privacy leakage and safeguards have been explored for gaze data collected through headsets and stationary eye trackers, but never for gaze data collected through handheld mobile devices, like smartphones. Eye tracking on handheld mobile devices has the potential to be ubiquitous, but gaze data is typically of lower quality, compounded by additional noise and instability due to less controlled environments and screen size constraints. To address this gap, we provide the first evidence of privacy leakage through gaze data collected on handheld mobile devices. In a user study (N=35), we collected our novel SmartEyePhone dataset of gaze data using a smartphone’s front-facing camera. Second, we present the first evaluation and comparison of three Differential Privacy (DP) techniques against our dataset and the T\"{u}EyeQ dataset, which was collected in prior work using a stationary remote eye tracker. We found that SmartEyePhone dataset leaks on average 65.5\% of private data. DP mechanisms reduce privacy leakage in our data by 22.33\% using Laplace mechanism, 10.43\% using Exponential mechanism, 22.60\% using Gaussian mechanism, and 28.34\% using AI model perturbation. However, this also reduces the accuracy of the main task prediction, and is impacted by the choice of privacy parameter values. We present insights on the tradeoff between privacy preservation and the practical usefulness of gaze data. Our insights advance the understanding of privacy in mobile settings and pave the way for privacy preserving gaze-enabled handheld mobile devices.},

abstract = {Human image datasets used to develop and evaluate technology should represent the variation in human phenotypes, including skin tone. Datasets that include skin tone information frequently rely on manual skin tone ratings based on the Fitzpatrick Skin Type (FST) or the Monk Skin Tone (MST) scales in lieu of the actual measured skin tone of the image dataset subjects. However, perceived skin tone is subject to known perceptual errors and skin tone appearance in digital images can vary substantially depending on the capture camera and environment, confounding manual ratings. Surprisingly, the relationship between skin tone ratings and measured skin tone has not been explored. To close this research gap, we measured the relationship between skin tone ratings from existing scales (FST, MST) and skin tone values measured by a calibrated colorimeter. We also propose and assess a novel Colorimetric Skin Tone (CST) scale developed based on prior colorimetric measurements. Using experiments requiring humans to rate their own skin tone and the skin tone of subjects in images, we show that the new CST scale is more sensitive, consistent, and colorimetrically accurate. While skin tone ratings appeared to correct for some color variation across images, they introduced perceptual errors related to race and other factors. These perceptual errors must be considered before using manual skin-tone ratings in technology evaluations or for engineering decisions.},

This study investigates the challenges of adopting immersive devices in transit, particularly when passengers encounter asymmetric experiences using disparate devices. These situations arise as co-located passengers adopt devices with varying levels of immersion, environmental information, and interactive capabilities. Using an enactment methodology in a transit scenario involving disparate devices, our study (N = 21) reveals that asymmetric passenger experiences create a sense of disconnection among passengers, especially with varying device immersion capabilities. When interactions require more than a basic response, for example complex verbal exchanges relying on social cues like gaze, adoption is further hindered. The incorporation of cues from reality addresses safety concerns but requires further refinement to support interactions that require complex or extended user involvement. This research advances the understanding of asymmetric passenger dynamics, contributing to the design of immersive technologies for transit settings.},

The review aimed to: (1) examine how researchers have involved AwDS in the design and evaluation of technologies; (2) identify the types of technologies explored and the motivations driving their use; (3) assess how these technologies support abilities across life domains; and (4) analyze the reported benefits, challenges, and design implications. Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we searched six academic databases (ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Compendex, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and SpringerLink), resulting in 1,944 articles. After applying the inclusion criteria, we identified 20 studies for in-depth analysis. Methods ranged from experimental to participatory design, with inclusive strategies such as caregiver involvement, visual aids, and personalized supports frequently reported. Technologies identified included computers and web platforms, mobile applications, AAC systems, smart home tools, and social robots, supporting areas like daily living, communication, learning, navigation, and health. Reported benefits included increased independence and digital inclusion, enhanced communication, expanded social connection, greater confidence and engagement, and enhanced skill development. Common challenges included interface complexity, lack of context-aware interaction, environmental and sensory constraints, and uneven impact across users. Based on these findings and paper analysis, we outline five design recommendations: reduce interaction complexity, support engagement through feedback and flexible pacing, enable personalization and long-term adaptability, provide accessible pathways to secure system access, and embed technology within everyday routines. This review emphasizes the importance of inclusive, user-centered systems that align with the goals, contexts, and lived experiences of AwDS.},

abstract = {The illegal wildlife trade is among the major threats to the global environment, with at least $26.5 billion lost annually and extreme impacts on biodiversity and ecological sustainability. In response, Sustainable Development Alternative Project (SDAP) will be implemented to serve as an integrated conservation approach. It targets the reduction of fully reported incidents of wildlife trafficking by at least 50\% within five years. We have developed Client Suitability System (CSS) that is hybrid, for we combined two models Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the enhanced Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) methods in selecting the best implementer. The highest-ranking institution that emerged was Brazil's Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renov\'{a}veis (IBAMA). The most effective intervention in reducing the level of illegal wildlife trade is educational intervention on the Crime Index. Predictive analysis based on the Gray Model (GM(1,1)) estimates a reduction of 60\% in wildlife trafficking incidents: this over and above what was originally planned with an 83.57\% probability of attaining success. Sensitivity analysis has proven, which shines the light very strongly on legal enforcement, in an area where more surveillance is needed. Our integrated computational framework leads to pragmatic recommendations on the optimization of interventions for conserving wildlife.},

abstract = {Real-time oxygen uptake is a crucial indicator in the field of high-altitude medicine. With the development of tiny wearable sensors and machine learning, oxygen uptake estimation via multi-physiological parameter fusion has drawn attention. However, existing methods mainly target the plain environment. Considering the significant impact of high-altitude hypoxia on oxygen uptake and the difficulty of collecting hypoxic data, we propose an enhanced Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) network with domain adaptation. The proposed method is capable of constructing the general oxygen uptake estimation model for different environments by only using a few data from the target hypoxic environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, the proposed method surpasses the state-of-the-art data-driven methods in terms of prediction accuracy and stability. The MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of GRU - DA under the four exercise states of rest, walking, climbing, and running are 1.79, 2.64, 3.2, and 3.95 ml/(kg·min) respectively. The comprehensive error is 3.14 ml/(kg·min), representing a 29.28\% improvement compared to the original model.},

abstract = {Cutting down once-thriving forests for agricultural development destroys the natural ecosystems of the forests. That had led to the loss of biodiversity and weakened ecosystems, making them more vulnerable to pests and diseases. Depletion of soil nutrients through monoculture and the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides by farmers have harmed the environment and species. As time goes on, a new food web is formed as agriculture grows, which includes species that help control pests and pollinate crops, such as birds, bats, and insects. For sustainable agriculture, the aim is to restore balance by promoting soil health, biodiversity and natural processes. For the purpose of this study, a food web was created based on the Lotka-Volterra equation. Then, a logistic growth model was integrated to create a function that captures the effects of cyclical changes over time. Next, we explored the potential immigration or re-emergence of various species. In addition, a profit maximization model was refined to determine the most efficient fertilization strategy. Finally, sensitivity analyses were conducted to estimate the effects of different parameters on model stability and accuracy.},

abstract = {High-precision time synchronization is a vital prerequisite for many modern applications and technologies, including Smart Grids, Time-sensitive Networking (TSN), and 5G networks. Although the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) can accomplish this requirement in trusted environments, it becomes unreliable in the presence of specific cyber attacks. Mainly, time delay attacks pose the highest threat to the protocol, enabling attackers to diverge targeted clocks undetected. With the increasing danger of cyber attacks, especially against critical infrastructure, there is a great demand for effective countermeasures to secure both time synchronization and the applications that depend on it. However, current solutions are not sufficiently capable of mitigating sophisticated delay attacks. For example, they lack proper integration into the PTP protocol, scalability, or sound evaluation with the required microsecond-level accuracy. This work proposes an approach to detect and counteract delay attacks against PTP, which is based on cyclic path asymmetry measurements over redundant paths. We leverage Software-defined Networking (SDN) capabilities to dynamically find these redundant paths in arbitrary networks, recommend new links to increase the network’s security, and ensure deterministic routing. Furthermore, we show how path redundancy can be utilized to reveal and mitigate undesirable asymmetries on the synchronization path that cause the malicious clock divergence. Moreover, we propose PTPsec, a secure PTP protocol, and its implementation based on the latest IEEE 1588-2019 standard. With PTPsec, we advance the conventional PTP to support reliable delay attack detection and mitigation. We validate our approach in software simulations and on a hardware testbed, which includes an attacker capable of performing static and incremental delay attacks at a microsecond precision. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach is scalable, and all attack scenarios can be reliably detected and mitigated with minimal detection time.},

abstract = {Path planning is a critical challenge for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) due to complex underwater environments, including ocean currents, dynamic obstacles, and limited sensing capabilities. The lack of a standardized benchmarking framework has hindered direct comparisons between algorithms, slowing progress in the field. To address this, we introduce an open-source benchmarking platform for underwater AUV path planning, designed to provide a unified evaluation environment, automated performance assessment, and reproducible experiments. Built on the HoloOcean simulation platform, our benchmark incorporates realistic underwater dynamics, such as ocean currents, static and dynamic obstacles, and sensor models. It supports a range of path planning tasks, from basic obstacle avoidance to complex scenarios with current disturbances. The platform is compatible with classical algorithms (e.g., A*, RRT), evolutionary methods (e.g., GA, ACO), and deep reinforcement learning (e.g., Soft Actor-Critic, SAC). We define key evaluation metrics, including path efficiency (length, smoothness, energy consumption), task success rate, collision rate, and computational cost. Automated tools enable systematic algorithm comparisons across scenarios, generating standardized performance results and visualizations. This open-source, extensible framework aims to advance underwater path planning research by enabling fair comparisons and guiding future algorithm development. It provides a scalable foundation for evaluating AUV path planning methods under simulated real-world conditions, fostering innovation in the field. All source code and experimental configurations will be available on the GitHub Page: https://github.com/IoET-y/UP-bench.},
