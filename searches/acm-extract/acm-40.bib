abstract = {In this paper, we present a data analysis pipeline to use inertial measurement systems and neural network models to track physiological signals relevant to sleep and resting state of dogs. We used accelerometer signals to assess the heart rate and respiratory rate and evaluated various sensor orientations on the neck. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of reconstructing electrocardiography (ECG) and respiration signals from an accelerometer signal collected from a resting or sleeping dog through a machine learning approach. We used a custom developed wireless heart rate sensor system to synchronously collect inertial measurement (IMU) signals on the neck and reference ground-truth ECG signals. We combined this with ground-truth respiration signals obtained from a commercial strain sensor. IMU signals from twelve different orientations on the collar were collected. We trained machine learning models to determine the collar position of the IMU sensor and select corresponding models to reconstruct ECG and respiration. Across twelve positions, our pipeline achieved, on average, 0.8671 F1 score and a 0.9131 heart rate estimation accuracy from reconstructed ECG, and a 0.7256 F1 score and a 0.8932 respiration rate accuracy from reconstructed respiration signals. These physiological measurements complement an on-going larger study where we use a smart collar with environmental and behavioral sensors to evaluate guide dog puppies being raised by volunteer raisers. With data collection from a larger set of animals and proper labeling, IMU based heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration rate, and body movement during rest and sleep offer a compelling solution to characterize sleep and resting states of working dogs to assess their performance, quality of life, health and welfare.},

abstract = {Head-worn wearables, such as consumer-grade EEG headsets deployed in Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI), are getting popularity in the gaming and entertainment industry, and for people with certain disabilities. However, the increasing popularity of these wearables creates a significant privacy risk. For instance, tech companies are intending to use brainwave devices to detect workers' emotional state and mental condition. There are AI techniques that can learn what people are looking at in real-time. Silently conversing with the computing system is now possible using neuromuscular signals, for instance, untold digit recognition with higher accuracy is possible, which can retrieve untold PIN or password. These applications can reveal more private information than designated benign purpose, such as, while detecting performance of worker, sensitive information like Parkinson's disease, substance abuse disorder, heart disease, can be revealed from brainwave. The consequences of these privacy leakages may be potentially devastating, such as tracking users for targeted advertisements and launching targeted attacks against users. In this paper, we analyze current devices, explore previously studied attacks, research efforts to extract information from brainwave and analyze and synthesize potential future attacks from the current deployment. This systematization will provide right direction towards ensuring privacy risk of BCI devices, which is a pre-requisite to building future defense mechanisms against the attacks.},

abstract = {Deploying machine learning models on-board edge devices allows for low latency model inference and data privacy by keeping sensor data local to the computation rather than at a central server. However, typical TinyML systems train a single global model which is duplicated across all edge devices. This leads to a model that is generalized to the training data, but not specialized to the unique physical environment where the device is deployed. In this work, we evaluate how we can train machine learning models on-board low-memory edge devices with streams of incoming data. When using these low-memory devices, storage space is at a minimum and as such, representative data samples from the data stream must be captured to ensure that the models can improve even with a limited set of available training samples. We propose the Variable Low/High Loss sampling method for selecting representative data samples from a data stream and demonstrate that our methods are able to increase the accuracy of the machine learning model compared to state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed method for WiFi sensing based human activity detection, where WiFi signals are used to predict human activities in a given environment without requiring sensors on their bodies.},

abstract = {We propose Breathe-to-Pair (B2P), a protocol for pairing and shared-key generation for wearable devices that leverages the wearer's respiration activity to ensure that the devices are part of the same body-area network. We assume that the devices exploit different types of sensors to extract and process the respiration signal. We illustrate B2P for the case of two devices that use respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) and accelerometer sensors, respectively. Allowing for different types of sensors in pairing allows us to include wearable devices that use a variety of different sensors. In practice, this form of sensor variety creates a number of challenges that limit the ability of the shared-key establishment algorithm to generate matching keys. The two main obstacles are the lack of synchronization across the devices and the need for correct noise-induced mismatches between the generated key bit-strings.B2P addresses the synchronization challenge by utilizing Change Point Detection (CPD) to detect abrupt changes in the respiration signal and consider their occurrences as synchronizing points. Any potential mismatches are handled by optimal quantization and encoding of the respiration signal in order to maximize the mismatch correction rate and minimize the message overheads. Extensive evaluation on a dataset collected from 30 volunteers demonstrates that our protocol can generate a secure 256-bit key every 2.85 seconds (around one breathing cycle). Particular attention is given to secure B2P against device impersonation attacks.},

We address whether eye gaze can be passively, reliably, and privately recorded in real-world environments across extended timeframes using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) sensors. We recorded eye gaze data from a COTS tracker embedded in participants (N=20) work environments at pseudorandom intervals across a two-week period. We found that valid samples were recorded approximately 30\% of the time despite calibrating the eye tracker only once and without placing any other restrictions on participants. The number of valid samples decreased over days with the degree of decrease dependent on contextual variables (i.e., frequency of video conferencing) and individual difference attributes (e.g., sleep quality and multitasking ability). Participants reported that sensors did not change or impact their work. Our findings suggest the potential for the collection of eye-gaze in authentic environments.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has strong potential to improve the accessibility and usability of our daily lives and industries, and various related technologies are being developed. In particular, IoT platforms are the role of middleware in IoT environments and are software that connects multiple devices such as various sensors, access points, and data networks. In addition, the open authorization (OAuth) 2.0 is an authorization framework standard for delegating authority to a third party and is widely used to protect APIs in IoT platforms and the existing web environments. However, interoperability and security are barriers that hinder the potential. Technologies have often been developed without adequate considerations for interoperability and security, such as the OAuth 2.0 framework widely used in IoT domains. Furthermore, most studies did not consider interoperability, even though interoperability among heterogeneous domains is critical for the IoT to share resources. No study addressed the limitation of the conventional OAuth 2.0 framework to support interoperability, and the studies did not comprehensively discuss the security of the OAuth 2.0 framework. Therefore, based on the well-known threats of the conventional OAuth 2.0 framework, we identify possible threats and proper countermeasures for the interoperable OAuth 2.0 framework (IOAF) to achieve security interoperability. In addition, we propose a new authorization code for multiple domains (ACMD) grant flow using a proof key for code exchange (PKCE), which is more secure than the current ACMD flow.},

abstract = {One of the most distinctive characteristics in biological evolution is to not only learn and reinforce knowledge from prior experience, but also develop a solution in (pseudo) real-time for future events by studying the past choices. Inspired by this observation, we aim at developing a systematic methodology of dynamically learning effective control policy for robotic manipulators that deftly avoid dynamic obstacles in fast-changing environments. Unfortunately, dynamical obstacles present time-varying statistical sensory irregularities, making learning based on prior experience much less productive. Furthermore, off-the-shelf policy gradient methods often become computationally expensive, and sometimes intractable, to adapt existing policy for dynamically changing environments. In this paper, to mitigate both of these challenges, we propose to use vector-valued kernel embedding (instead of parameter vectors) to represent policy distribution as features in non-decreasing Euclidean space. Furthermore, we develop policy search algorithm over Bayesian posterior estimation derived from inner-product of a priori Gaussian kernels, allowing the search space to be defined as high (possibly infinite) dimensional Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS).Our empirical results have shown that our proposed method performs optimally in a collaborative multi-robot setting, where two robot arms can manipulate in dynamic real-world environment, incrementally modifying their motion plan, to maintain a smooth, collision-free manipulation. In particular, comparing against a state-of-the-art DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)-based obstacle avoidance scheme as the baseline, our DRL (Developmental Reinforcement Learning) agent can not only effectively avoid dynamically generated obstacles while achieving its control objective, but do so with ~ 25 times faster in learning performance.

abstract = {For intelligent home IoT services with sensors and machine learning, we need to upload IoT data to the cloud server which cannot share private data for training. A recent machine learning approach, called federated learning, keeps user data on the device in the distributed computing environment. Though federated learning is useful for protecting privacy, it experiences poor performance in terms of the end-to-end response time in home IoT services, because IoT devices are usually controlled by remote servers in the cloud. In addition, it is difficult to achieve the high accuracy of federated learning models due to insufficient data problems and model inversion attacks. In this paper, we propose a local IoT control method for a federated learning home service that recognizes the user behavior in the home network quickly and accurately. We present a federated learning client with transfer learning and differential privacy to solve data scarcity and data model inversion attack problems. From experiments, we show that the local control of home IoT devices for user authentication and control message transmission by the federated learning clients improves the response time to less than 1 second. Moreover, we demonstrate that federated learning with transfer learning achieves 97\% of accuracy under 9,000 samples, which is only 2\% of the difference from centralized learning.},

abstract = {The single-board computer (SBC) is a compact, powerful and cost-effective system on chip (SOC) that can perform all complex tasks that may be executed by the desktop computer. Further, with the development of the SBCs having a powerful processor and high RAM support–they are already deployed in many applications such as in agriculture, home security, automation, drones, unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) and like-wise. However, each SBC has a unique capability and therefore some SBC may perform better than others depending upon the application. Further, some SBC has high processing power but they are either costly or support fewer I/O pins. Similarly, some SBC are cost-effective, has a high number of I/O pins but they have quite less processing power for executing complex instructions and tasks. In addition, for some SBC there is no dedicated integrated development environment (IDE) available that can be used to program SBC according to the user-specific need. Due to these above-mentioned problems, the user has to either invest in the high processing power SBC (having high price) but compromise with less I/O pins or invest in the SBC (having low price) that has the high number of I/O pins but compromise with low processing power (although there are some SBCs available in the market that has high processing power along with the high number of I/O pins. But they are available at a quite high price so we are not considering these SBCs). In both cases, the user is not able to integrate intelligent high processing sensors and equip the system in which SBC is used with new features over time. To over this problem, we are introducing a smart and highly intelligent hybrid implementation of Raspberry pi model 3b+ with Arduino UNO board for controlling UGV. During testing, we have found that our developed hybrid SBC system for UGV work quite impressively. The CPU utilization and CPU temperature readings of the hybrid system are noted while performing various complex tasks on the UGV. Further during the evaluation process, it is observed that UGV consumed a maximum of 80\% of system CPU utilization to perform all the allocated tasks efficiently. The rest 20\% of the CPU usage as well as some of the GPIO pins of Raspberry pi are reserved and can be used to implement various complex applications in the UGV based on the user requirement.},

Personal Informatics (PI) systems augmented by algorithms and sensors have become popular ways to help users collect and reflect on data about stress. While prediction algorithms in the PI systems are mainly for diagnostic purposes, few studies examine how the explainability of algorithmic prediction can support user-driven self-insight. To this end, we developed MindScope, an algorithm-assisted stress management system that determines user stress levels and explains how the stress level was computed based on the user’s everyday activities captured by a smartphone. In a 25-day field study conducted with 36 college students, the prediction and explanation supported self-reflection, a process to re-establish preconceptions about stress by identifying stress patterns and recalling past stress levels and patterns that led to coping planning. We discuss the implications of exploiting prediction algorithms that facilitate user-driven retrospection in PI systems.},

abstract = {Teleportation, which instantly moves users from their current location to the target location, has become the most popular locomotion technique in VR games. It enables fast navigation with reduced VR sickness but results in significantly reduced immersion. We present HeadWind, a novel approach to improve the experience of teleportation by simulating the haptic sensation of air drag when rapidly moving through the air in real life. Specifically, HeadWind modulates bursts of compressed air to the face and uses multiple nozzles to provide directional cues. To design the wearable device and to model airflow speed and duration for teleportation, we conducted three formative studies and a design session. User experience evaluation with 24 participants showed that HeadWind significantly improved realism, immersion, and enjoyment of teleportation in VR (p&lt;.01) with large effect sizes (r&gt;0.5), and was preferred by 96\% of participants.},

abstract = {Despite the advent of touchscreens, typing on physical keyboards remains most efficient for entering text, because users can leverage all fingers across a full-size keyboard for convenient typing. As users increasingly type on the go, text input on mobile and wearable devices has had to compromise on full-size typing. In this paper, we present TapType, a mobile text entry system for full-size typing on passive surfaces—without an actual keyboard. From the inertial sensors inside a band on either wrist, TapType decodes and relates surface taps to a traditional QWERTY keyboard layout. The key novelty of our method is to predict the most likely character sequences by fusing the finger probabilities from our Bayesian neural network classifier with the characters’ prior probabilities from an n-gram language model. In our online evaluation, participants on average typed 19 words per minute with a character error rate of 0.6\% after 30 minutes of training. Expert typists thereby consistently achieved more than 25&nbsp;WPM at a similar error rate. We demonstrate applications of TapType in mobile use around smartphones and tablets, as a complement to interaction in situated Mixed Reality outside visual control, and as an eyes-free mobile text input method using an audio feedback-only interface.},

abstract = {Haptic Feedback is essential for lifelike Virtual Reality (VR) experiences. To provide a wide range of matching sensations of being touched or stroked, current approaches typically need large numbers of different physical textures. However, even advanced devices can only accommodate a limited number of textures to remain wearable. Therefore, a better understanding is necessary of how expectations elicited by different visualizations affect haptic perception, to achieve a balance between physical constraints and great variety of matching physical textures. In this work, we conducted an experiment (N=31) assessing how the perception of roughness is affected within VR. We designed a prototype for arm stroking and compared the effects of different visualizations on the perception of physical textures with distinct roughnesses. Additionally, we used the visualizations’ real-world materials, no-haptics and vibrotactile feedback as baselines. As one result, we found that two levels of roughness can be sufficient to convey a realistic illusion.},

abstract = {Soft actuators with integrated sensing have shown utility in a variety of applications such as assistive wearables, robotics, and interactive input devices. Despite their promise, these actuators can be difficult to both design and fabricate. As a solution, we present a workflow for computationally designing and digitally fabricating soft pneumatic actuators via a machine knitting process. Machine knitting is attractive as a fabrication process because it is fast, digital (programmable), and provides access to a rich material library of functional yarns for specified mechanical behavior and integrated sensing. Our method uses elastic stitches to construct non-homogeneous knitting structures, which program the bending of actuators when inflated. Our method also integrates pressure and swept frequency capacitive sensing structures using conductive yarns. The entire knitted structure is fabricated automatically in a single machine run. We further provide a computational design interface for the user to interactively preview actuators’ quasi-static shape when authoring elastic stitches. Our sensing-integrated actuators are cost-effective, easy to design, robust to large actuation, and require minimal manual post-processing. We demonstrate five use-cases of our actuators in relevant application settings.},

abstract = {Over the last few years, there has been an increased proliferation of IoT systems for smart homes, enabling owners to remotely manage a variety of devices and gadgets installed on their properties. This growth was made possible due to several innovative contributions from the industry in device \&amp; sensor technology, efficient networking protocols, as well as extensive deployment of cloud infrastructure, and the development of user-friendly smartphone applications. However, the security of such systems, especially controlled access to the devices and their functionality, is still lagging. There were some recent attempts to develop access control methods for smart home IoTs. While the solutions appear to be interesting, they either ignore the practical issues faced during real-world deployment in IoT systems or do not support fine-grained access control as required by such applications. In this paper, we show how the security of smart home IoT systems can be strengthened through the use of attribute-based access control, which has been considered due to its several distinct advantages including the ability to specify fine-grained security policies and consideration of environmental conditions for making access decisions. A prototype implementation of the proposed framework has been done in the SmartThings IoT platform. An extensive set of experiments show that the approach is quite promising.},

abstract = {The development of industrial automation is closely related to the evolution of mobile robot positioning and navigation mode. In this paper, we introduce ASL-SLAM, the first line-based SLAM system operating directly on robots using the event sensor only. This approach maximizes the advantages of the event information generated by a bio-inspired sensor. We estimate the local Surface of Active Events (SAE) to get the planes for each incoming event in the event stream. Then the edges and their motion are recovered by our line extraction algorithm. We show how the inclusion of event-based line tracking significantly improves performance compared to state-of-the-art frame-based SLAM systems. The approach is evaluated on publicly available datasets. The results show that our approach is particularly effective with poorly textured frames when the robot faces simple or low texture environments. We also experimented with challenging illumination situations to order to be suitable for various industrial environments, including low-light and high motion blur scenarios. We show that our approach with the event-based camera has natural advantages and provides up to 85\% reduction in error when performing SLAM under these conditions compared to the traditional approach.},

abstract = {The brain computer interface (BCI) is one of the technologies that has a lot of potential for helping people with physiological and physical difficulties. This technology could be used to treat disabled individuals or assist them with daily duties that they are unable to perform owing to their ailments. By fooling the brain to redirect the senses and discomfort, this could also help chronic pain patients forget about their pain. When a person is immersed in a virtual environment, this technology and Virtual Reality (VR) can both be used to teach patients or influence the brain. The users are immersed in a reality that does not exist, but the brain accepts it and allows them to experience things that are not yet possible for a human to do. By combining these two technologies to develop an application and conduct study into how these two technologies, for example, can assist patients suffering from pain in any region of their body. These strategies can aid recovery while also making the process less tedious than traditional ways. An interactive simulation that patients can engage with or a brain-controlled robot that can help patients will be effective and useful. This application also can be used to create a computer and mechanical interface which a user can control a machine or device with, or even a mouse pointer by only thinking about it. A paralyzed person might not be able to move his/her arm, but the signal from the brain is constantly sending to the arm from brain, allows them to control a mechanical arm instead. We can enable people with disabilities do things that are impossible for them to do by taking those signals and allowing a mechanical arm to do what an actual arm would do.The possibilities and application for these technologies are vast, brain to brain communication is nothing new to discuss, but it will be possible to create such a device that two people from two side of the planet can feel each other's feeling and communicate via their brain. In this research, we studied how we can utilize this system to manipulate the brain to help patients recover faster. Our focus in this study is development of BCI and VR applications that can be useful to help chronic patients and disable people. Furthermore, we studied how we could develop a gamified interactive environment for patients to aid in their recovery as they are enjoying their time interacting with these tools in a virtual world.},

abstract = {The particularity of the marine underwater environment has brought many challenges to the development of underwater sensor networks (UWSNs). This research realized the effective monitoring of targets by UWSNs and achieved higher quality of service in various applications such as communication, monitoring, and data transmission in the marine environment. After analysis of the architecture, the marine integrated communication network system (MICN system) is constructed based on the maritime wireless Mesh network (MWMN) by combining with the UWSNs. A distributed hybrid fish swarm optimization algorithm (FSOA) based on mobility of underwater environment and artificial fish swarm (AFS) theory is proposed in response to the actual needs of UWSNs. The proposed FSOA algorithm makes full use of the perceptual communication of sensor nodes and lets the sensor nodes share the information covered by each other as much as possible, enhancing the global search ability. In addition, a reliable transmission protocol NC-HARQ is put forward based on the combination of network coding (NC) and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). In this work, three sets of experiments are performed in an area of 200 \texttimes{} 200 \texttimes{} 200 m. The simulation results show that the FSOA algorithm can fully cover the events, effectively avoid the blind movement of nodes, and ensure consistent distribution density of nodes and events. The NC-HARQ protocol proposed uses relay nodes for retransmission, and the probability of successful retransmission is much higher than that of the source node. At a distance of more than 2,000 m, the successful delivery rate of data packets is as high as 99.6\%. Based on the MICN system, the intelligent ship constructed with the digital twins framework can provide effective ship operating state prediction information. In summary, this study is of great value for improving the overall performance of UWSNs and advancing the monitoring of marine data information.},

As face masks have become daily accessories since the COVID-19 pandemic, it is reasonable to utilize a mask as a wearable interface. Unlike conventional speech recognition, we envision that silent speech interaction allows users to access digital services even in crowded public spaces. With flexible and highly sensitive strain sensors, E-MASK presents a new measurement principle for silent speech interactions. We built a dataset of sensor patterns corresponding to 21 fundamental commands of Alexa’s operation. All commands were silently spoken by five non-native English speakers. The dataset was used to estimate the silently spoken commands. Estimation accuracies of 84.4\% while sitting on a chair and 79.1\% while walking on a treadmill were archived. This result suggests that our system provides seamless interaction with digital devices in various situations in daily life, such as walking in a crowd.},

abstract = {Telecommunications systems with Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) structure using Orthogonal Frequency Division Modulation (OFDM) have great potential for efficient application to a network of Internet of Things (IoT) at a high data rate. When the IoT network is among the underwater sensory devices known as the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT), the electromagnetic wave cannot play the role of baseband signal due to rapid fall-off inside the water. Thus, acoustic OFDM is a reliable replacement for conventional OFDM inside the water. A blind structure for MIMO acoustic OFDM using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) brings even further advantages in data rate and energy consumption by avoiding the required pilot and preamble data. This research work presents a blind MIMO Acoustic OFDM blind transceiver for IoUT based on Probabilistic Stone’s Blind Source Separation (PS-BSS). The proposed technique has multiple times lower complexity compared to the ICA-based technique while maintaining a comparable efficiency. As observed in the results carried out with 100 Monte Carlo runs of transmission of random data bits over a highly sparse channel that is the common case of an underwater environment, the proposed PS-BSS-based technique dominates the ICA-based one, and as the sparseness of the channel decreases, its efficiency is comparable to the ICA-based technique. Thus, in the case of a highly sparse channel, the proposed technique is superior in both aspects of efficiency and complexity, while over lower sparseness, due to its comparative efficiency, it can be hired as an optimum technique fulfilling a fair tradeoff between efficiency and complexity.},

abstract = {The skin, as the largest organ distributed all over the human body, offers excellent opportunities for different kinds of input stimuli. However, most of the haptic devices can only render single sensations or they need to combine multiple complex components for generating multiple sensations. We present “DragTapVib” in this paper, a novel, ultra-low-cost, wearable actuator that can reliably provide dragging, tapping, and vibrating sensations to the user. Our actuator is fully electromagnetically-actuated with a moving tactor that can render three haptic feedbacks through systematically controlling the current inside the flexible PCBs. The actuator can be arranged with varying parts of the body which enriches the potentials to implement promising application scenarios including delivering the notification and providing immersive haptic feedback either in virtual reality or in gameplay. A prototypical technical evaluation demonstrated the mechanical properties of our actuator. We quantitatively conducted a series of psychophysical user studies (N= 12) to reveal the feasibility of our prototype. The overall absolute identification study for distinguishing three sensations accuracy at two body locations reached up to 97.2\%.},

Nowadays, a variety of infrastructures from diverse fields are limited by external and internal environmental factors. In actual operation, these factors may cause serious anomalies and aggravate the burden of facilities’ maintenance. With a rise in the number and running time, the performance of these facilities would be unstable and complex. This paper proposes a deep learning framework (CLAD) to do adaptive anomaly detection. It implements dynamic anomaly thresholding based on the prediction of incremental Long Short-Term Memory. This framework employs a replay buffer to solve the decline of detection accuracy. With this framework, models can keep perfect detection accuracy under a quite high load (time and number). This framework is valuable for further research of adaptive anomaly detection.},

abstract = {The expansion of smart cities around the world in recent years has necessitated the protection of building infrastructure and the environment from the possibility of a fire outbreak. Existing fire safety and protection systems have to be upgraded for optimal usage with Internet of Things-enabled equipment in smart buildings, necessitating the creation of a better fire safety and protection model for smart buildings in the context of smart cities. Sensors detect and report conditions surrounding a fire occurrence in this project, which uses Internet of Things-enabled devices to provide fire safety and protection services for smart buildings. In order to determine the fire state in real time, flame and gas sensors were put in the smart building. The design was modelled, simulated, and constructed using Proteus software with code written in Arduino IDE, and the data gathered from the design was evaluated using ThingSpeak, which has MATLAB software capability. After demonstrating this upgraded model in a 3600m \texttimes{} 3600m smart room, the result obtained shows that within the temperature of 21 to 37oC, there was no fire detected in the building, whereas, temperature above 53.5 to 58oC indicate the presence of fire in the building. Similarly, the smoke sensor value at 24ppm shows that there is no smoke in the building, while at 56ppm and above indicates that there is smoke in the building. An attempt will be made to demonstrate it in a huge smart city environment.},

abstract = {The rise of GPS-equipped mobile devices has led to the emergence of big trajectory data. The collected raw data usually contain errors and anomalies information caused by device failure, sensor error, and environment influence. Low-quality data fails to support application requirements and therefore raw data will be comprehensively cleaned before usage. Existing methods are suboptimal to detect GPS data errors and do the repairing. To solve the problem, we propose a framework called GPSClean to analyze the anomalies data and develop effective methods to repair the data. There are primarily four modules in GPSClean: (i) data preprocessing, (ii) data filling, (iii) data repairing, and (iv) data conversion. For (i), we propose an approach named MDSort (Maximum Disorder Sorting) to efficiently solve the issue of data disorder. For (ii), we propose a method named NNF (Nearest Neighbor Filling) to fill missing data. For (iii), we design an approach named RCSWS (Range Constraints and Sliding Window Statistics) to repair anomalies and also improve the accuracy of data repairing by mak7ing use of driving direction. We use 45 million real trajectory data to evaluate our proposal in a prototype database system SECONDO. Experimental results show that the accuracy of RCSWS is three times higher than an alternative method SCREEN and nearly an order of magnitude higher than an alternative method EWMA.},

abstract = {A smart wheelchair refers to a Powered Wheelchair (PW) with computers, sensors, and assistive technology attached. Our research is concerned with a Smart Wheelchair with sensing capability, designed to provide global accessibility. This paralyzing phenomenon affected many great individuals like Stephen Hawking and Max Brito. In this paper, wheelchair users have access to a variety of situations related to their everyday life. Our project attempts to make the lives of the people suffering from disabilities easier and simpler, helping them be more self-reliant and independent, which restores their confidence and restores their happiness. Moreover, this system is designed to make it easier for people with disabilities to move about freely without harming themselves or the environment. It helps them to control their home easily as well. It will help disabled people operate the wheelchair on their own. The technology of Android is a key to helping people interact with machines and tools in new ways. As a result, their problem can be addressed by using android technology to control the movement of a wheelchair. A wheelchair monitored and controlled by an application of android mobile is created to assist handicapped individuals by controlling the movement of a wheelchair in a different direction. The IW Smart Wheelchair model utilizes algorithms and systems that are meant to give safe navigation assistance through collision avoidance and also provides more flexibility for individuals with disabilities and for the elderly people to control the smart home. The system software's main function is to use the IW smart wheelchair model and sensors to control various devices such as doors, windows, lights, and temperature. The mobile unit and the microcontroller unit are the two main components of the system software. This paper covers our goals of the design for the IW Smart Wheelchair model and by extension the IW Smart Wheelchair, as well as the present state of the system prototype and future work plans.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchain technologies have been utilized heavily in diverse domains, including remote patient monitoring (RPM). Expeditious development of wearable IoT medical devices with a variety of functionality, real-time sensory data from patients can be provided and further processed. IoT data are centrally collected, processed, and stored. But this centralization may face different problems including single-point failure, data tampering, privacy issues, etc. Blockchain can address these problems using its decentralized architecture. Hence, the combination of IoT and blockchain is a plausible solution to design a smart RPM system. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of the existing literature that has integrated blockchain with IoT-based systems from the perspective of remote patient monitoring. We have also proposed comprehensive IoT-blockchain based RPM framework guideline that addresses all aspects of designing an RPM system. Our proposed framework addresses the challenges of IoT-blockchain based systems, fulfills the requirements of real-time remote patient monitoring systems, and integrates the best practices of the literature in the relevant domains.},

abstract = {The amount of gadgets connected to the internet has grown rapidly in the recent years. These human owned devices can potentially be used to gather sensor data without active involvement of their owners. One of the types of platforms that contribute to the utilisation of these devices are mobile crowdsensing systems. These systems can be used for different tasks including different types of community support. While these systems are quite widely used, yet little research has been done for integration of imagery data into them which require also human involvement. This paper considers a mobile crowdsensing system where gathering data from sensors is supported by crowdsourcing human intelligence for providing both textual and visual information. We also explore the best settings for such a system. Imagery processing is integrated into an already existing mobile crowdsensing platform CrowdS. The solution was evaluated both by a limited number of real life users and by conducting simulations. The simulations represent complex scenarios with multi-level variables. The results of simulation allow suggest an efficient configuration for the parameters and characteristics of the environment used in imagery integration.},

This method uses the advantages of LoRa technology in low power consumption and long transmission distance, and uses a high-performance RTU and multiple LoRa low-power RTUs to form a star relay communication network architecture, It can effectively reduce the overall power consumption and volume weight of wireless communication in debris flow monitoring and warning system. The high-performance RTU supports 4G, Beidou short message and other communication modes, and the low-power RTU is developed based on the low-power STM32 MCU chip and sx1278 LoRa chip, which has the advantages of small size and low power consumption. The test results show that a high-performance RTU can communicate with at least eight low-power RTUs. The communication distance between high-performance RTU and low-power RTU can reach 3.2km in intervisibility environment, and 1km in mountainous environment. The relay communication method can meet the data communication requirements of multi-sensor debris flow monitoring and warning system in mountainous areas.},

abstract = {Keeping a distance by monitoring the seat occupancy is an essential way to prevent the spread of virus inside a room. However, most current human sensing methods need customized devices, so a cheaper way of indoor seat occupancy classification is in need. Recent researches indicate that Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI) can be utilized for indoor human sensing without wearable sensors. This paper proposes a multi-person seat occupancy classification method based on machine learning and Wi-Fi CSI received by commercial network interface card. We designed an experimental scenario of 5 seats and 2 individuals, and use commercial Wi-Fi devices to build a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system indoors to acquire an adequate dataset. Then a pipeline consists of phase calibration, linear interpolation, outlier removal and threshold de-noising was applied to preprocess the raw CSI amplitude and phase data. After sliding window feature extraction, convolutional neural network (CNN) and some conventional machine learning methods, such as naive Bayes (NB), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM) and K-nearest neighbors (KNN), are used to classify seat occupancy, among which CNN performs the best, with a classification accuracy of 95\%.},

abstract = {Deep learning has recently been widely applied to many applications across different domains, e.g., image classification and audio recognition. However, the quality of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) still raises concerns in the practical operational environment, which calls for systematic testing, especially in safety-critical scenarios. Inspired by software testing, a number of structural coverage criteria are designed and proposed to measure the test adequacy of DNNs. However, due to the blackbox nature of DNN, the existing structural coverage criteria are difficult to interpret, making it hard to understand the underlying principles of these criteria. The relationship between the structural coverage and the decision logic of DNNs is unknown. Moreover, recent studies have further revealed the non-existence of correlation between the structural coverage and DNN defect detection, which further posts concerns on what a suitable DNN testing criterion should be.In this article, we propose the interpretable coverage criteria through constructing the decision structure of a DNN. Mirroring the control flow graph of the traditional program, we first extract a decision graph from a DNN based on its interpretation, where a path of the decision graph represents a decision logic of the DNN. Based on the control flow and data flow of the decision graph, we propose two variants of path coverage to measure the adequacy of the test cases in exercising the decision logic. The higher the path coverage, the more diverse decision logic the DNN is expected to be explored. Our large-scale evaluation results demonstrate that: The path in the decision graph is effective in characterizing the decision of the DNN, and the proposed coverage criteria are also sensitive with errors, including natural errors and adversarial examples, and strongly correlate with the output impartiality.},

abstract = {Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) comprise a network of sensors subcutaneously implanted or placed near the body surface and facilitate continuous monitoring of health parameters of a patient. Research endeavours involving WBAN are directed towards effective transmission of detected parameters to a Local Processing Unit (LPU, usually a mobile device) and analysis of the parameters at the LPU or a back-end cloud. An important concern in WBAN is the lightweight nature of WBAN nodes and the need to conserve their energy. This is especially true for subcutaneously implanted nodes that cannot be recharged or regularly replaced. Work in energy conservation is mostly aimed at optimising the routing of signals to minimise energy expended. In this article, a simple yet innovative approach to energy conservation and detection of alarming health status is proposed. Energy conservation is ensured through a two-tier approach wherein the first tier eliminates “uninteresting” health parameter readings at the site of a sensing node and prevents these from being transmitted across the WBAN to the LPU. The second tier of assessment includes a proposed anomaly detection model at the LPU that is capable of identifying anomalies from streaming health parameter readings and indicates an adverse medical condition. In addition to being able to handle streaming data, the model works within the resource-constrained environments of an LPU and eliminates the need of transmitting the data to a back-end cloud, ensuring further energy savings. The anomaly detection capability of the model is validated using data available from the critical care units of hospitals and is shown to be superior to other anomaly detection techniques.},

The proposed model captures eye and fingernail images using a smartphone camera and automatically extracts the conjunctiva and fingernails as the regions of interest. A novel algorithm extracts the dominant color by analyzing color spectroscopy of the extracted portions and accurately predicts blood hemoglobin level. A less than 11.5 gdL ( ^{-1} )  value is categorized as anemia while a greater than 16.5 gdL ( ^{-1} )  value as polycythemia. The model incorporates machine learning and image processing techniques allowing easy smartphone implementation. The model predicts blood hemoglobin to an accuracy of  ( pm ) 0.33 gdL ( ^{-1} ) , a bias of 0.2 gdL ( ^{-1} ) , and a sensitivity of 90 ( \% )  compared to clinically tested results on 99 participants. Furthermore, a novel brightness adjustment algorithm is developed, allowing robustness to a wide illumination range and the type of device used. The proposed IoMT framework allows virtual consultations between physicians and patients, as well as provides overall public health information. The model thereby establishes itself as an authentic and acceptable replacement for invasive and clinically-based hemoglobin tests by leveraging the feature of self-anemia and polycythemia diagnosis.},

abstract = {In recent years, user identification has become crucial for authorized machine access. Electrocardiography (ECG) is a new and rising biometrics signature. Rather than traditional biological traits, ECG cannot be easily imitated. In the long-term monitoring system, the wireless wearable ECG biomedical sensor nodes are resource-limited. Recently, compressive sensing (CS) technology is extensively applied to reduce the power of data transmission and acquisition. The prior CS-based reconstruction process aims at improving energy efficiency with different schemes, and they focus on the performance of reconstruction only. Therefore, we present a sparse coding-based classifier, trained by task-driven dictionary learning (TDDL), to realize low-complexity user identification in compressed-domain directly. TDDL is one of the dictionary learning and designed for classification tasks. It co-optimizes the dictionary and classifier weighting simultaneously, which gives better accuracy. In this article, we are proposing a TDDL-based compression learning algorithm for ECG biometric user identification as this directly identifies user identity (ID) without undergoing reconstruction process and conventional classifier. It can extract necessary information from the compressed-ECG signal directly to save the system power and computational complexity. The algorithm has 2\%–10\% accuracy improvements compared with state-of-the-art algorithms and maintains low complexity at the same time. Our proposed TDDL-CL will be the better choice in the long-term wearable ECG biometric devices.},

abstract = {With the development of service industry, tourism has gradually become the pillar industry of the country, especially in ethnic areas. Due to the disadvantages of geographical location and transportation, the development of its primary and secondary industries is relatively weak. At the same time, due to its unique geographical style and ethnic customs, tourism has gradually become the pillar industry in ethnic areas. However, with the development of tourism, the local characteristics of commercial tourism areas in urban areas of ethnic minority areas are not obvious, and the problem of fuzzy local identity is prominent, which reduces the sense of locality of residents. Residents are both participants and consumers of urban tourism areas. The reduction of the sense of locality of urban residents in ethnic minority areas will not be conducive to the further development of tourism in ethnic minority areas, The development of smart tourism will affect the sense of place of residents in ethnic areas through network. Taking Enshi city residents of Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture as an example, this paper investigates the dissemination of online tourism information and residents' sense of place in Enshi City through interview and questionnaire, and then through descriptive statistical analysis Reliability and validity test and correlation analysis test the reliability of the questionnaire and data and the impact of online tourism information dissemination on the sense of place of urban residents in ethnic areas. The results show that the sense of place of urban residents in ethnic minority areas is generally high, but the sense of place in the sense of place is low. The low sense of place may be that urban construction needs to be improved, especially in the aspects of citizens' entertainment activities, the embodiment of urban environment on Tujia culture, whether community service is perfect and ideal place of work. At the same time, there is a significant positive correlation between the dissemination of online tourism information and the sense of place of urban residents in ethnic areas. Finally, through the above research results, some suggestions are put forward to improve the sense of place of urban residents in ethnic areas.},

abstract = {The increasing use of Internet of Things devices coincides with more communication and data movement in networks, which can exceed existing network capabilities. These devices often process sensor or user information, where data privacy and latency are a major concern. Therefore, traditional approaches like cloud computing do not fit well, yet new architectures such as edge computing address this gap. In addition, the Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) paradigm gains in prevalence as a workload execution platform, however the decoupling of storage results in further challenges for highly distributed edge environments.To address this, we propose SyncMesh, a system to manage, query, and transform data in a scalable and stateless manner by leveraging the capabilities of Function-as-a-Service and at the same time enabling data locality. Furthermore, we provide a prototypical implementation and evaluate it against established centralized and decentralized systems in regard to traffic usage and request times.The preliminary results indicate that SyncMesh is able to exonerate the network layer and accelerate the transmission of data to clients, while simultaneously improving local data processing.},

abstract = {Modern software does not stand alone; it is embedded in complex physical and sociotechnical systems. It relies on computational support from interdependent subsystems as well as non-code resources such as data, communications, sensors, and interactions with humans. Both general-purpose programming languages and mainstream programming language research focus on symbolic notations with well-defined abstractions that are intended for use by professionals to write programs that solve precisely specified problems. There is a strong emphasis on correctness of the resulting programs, preferably by formal reasoning. However, these languages, despite their careful design and formal foundations, address only a modest portion of modern software and only a minority of software developers.  Several persistent myths reinforce this focus. These myths express an idealized model of software and software development. They provide a lens for examining modern software and software development practice: highly trained professionals are outnumbered by vernacular developers. Writing new code is dominated by composition of ill-specified software and non-software components. General-purpose languages may be less appropriate for a task than domain-specific languages, and functional correctness is often a less appropriate goal than overall fitness for task. Support for programming to meet a specification is of little help to people who are programming in order to understand their problems. Reasoning about software is challenged by uncertainty and nondeterminism in the execution environment and by the increasingly dominant role of data, especially with the advent of systems that rely on machine learning. The lens of our persistent myths illuminates the dissonance between our idealized view of software development and common practice, which enables us to identify emerging opportunities and challenges for programming language research.},

abstract = {The sampling time is not timely, and the data information is not detailed due to equal interval sampling in landslide disaster monitoring, and it is difficult to meet the real-time perception of abnormal changes of disaster bodies. This paper presents a large landslide intelligent sensing monitoring technology based on adaptive data acquisition. The overall structure design, hardware and software design scheme of intelligent sensing monitoring technology are introduced in detail. The technology can realize rapid perception of environmental changes and deformation factor changes of landslide disaster bodies. The adaptive data acquisition strategy designed has good capture ability for abnormal changes of monitoring parameters of disaster bodies. It is a good alternative to realize real-time data acquisition of disaster bodies, so as to provide effective data guarantee for intelligent monitoring and disaster prediction of landslide disasters.},

abstract = {Connected sensors, e.g., cameras, LiDARs, air sensors, installed in a mobile platform (e.g., a terrestrial or aerial vehicle, or special in-person devices) can provide broad views of wide-area environments quickly and efficiently. If many vehicles incorporate such sensing systems, they together can be composed into a unique crowd-sourced platform and can gather fine-grained, diverse, and noisy information at city-scales. However, these sensors can generate large amounts of data and such data is hard to aggregate in a central server. We explore the design of a "roaming edge" - the notion that generalpurpose computing be installed in these mobile platforms, which connect over wireless paths to the static infrastructure and to the static edge nodes, to support a broad range of applications. In particular, a roaming edge node allows different sensors and data sources in-range of a mobile platform to connect to it, and supports data processing for necessary local analytics, considering both efficiency and privacy. The roaming edge, of course, does not operate in isolation and we describe a three-tier architecture that integrates it with a static edge and cloudhosted services. This paper also outlines several applications that can leverage opportunities provided by the roaming edge, and focus, briefly, on one - a real-time video query application with public safety implications.},

abstract = {Earbuds, ear-worn wearables, have attracted growing attention from both industry and academia. This trend has witnessed manufacturers embedding multiple sensors on earbuds to enrich their functionalities. For example, Apple AirPods, Sony WF-1000XM3, and Bose QuietControl 30, have been equipped with accelerometers for tapping interaction or multiple microphones for noise cancellation. On the other hand, the research community regards earbuds as a powerful personal-scale human sensing and computing platform. By integrating sensors like PPG, barometer, and ultrasonic sensors, researchers have been devising a plethora of earable sensing applications, such as blood pressure monitoring [1], facial expression recognition [2], and authentication [3].},

abstract = {Proper indoor ventilation through buildings' heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems has become an increasing public health concern that significantly impacts individuals' health and safety at home, work, and school. While much work has progressed in providing energy-efficient and user comfort for HVAC systems through IoT devices and mobile-sensing approaches, ventilation is an aspect that has received lesser attention despite its importance. With a motivation to monitor airflow from building ventilation systems through commodity sensing devices, we present FlowSense, a machine learning-based algorithm to predict airflow rate from sensed audio data in indoor spaces. Our ML technique can predict the state of an air vent---whether it is on or off---as well as the rate of air flowing through active vents. By exploiting a low-pass filter to obtain low-frequency audio signals, we put together a privacy-preserving pipeline that leverages a silence detection algorithm to only sense sounds of from HVAC air vents when no human speech is detected. We also propose the Minimum Persistent Sensing (MPS) as a post-processing algorithm to reduce interference from ambient noise, including ongoing human conversation, office machines, and traffic noises. Together, these techniques ensure user privacy and improve the robustness of FlowSense. We validate our approach yielding over 90\% accuracy in predicting vent status and 0.96 MSE in predicting airflow rate when the device is placed within 2.25 meters away from an air vent. Our approach can be generalized to environments with similar vent dimensions and geometry outlets. Additionally, we demonstrate how our approach as a mobile audio-sensing platform is robust to smartphone models, distance, and orientation. Finally, we evaluate FlowSense privacy-preserving pipeline through a user study and a Google Speech Recognition service, confirming that the audio signals we used as input data are inaudible and inconstructible.},
