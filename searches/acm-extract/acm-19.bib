abstract = {With the development of industry, the demand for manipulator, especially language controlled intelligent manipulator, is increasing in modern society. In recent years, research in the field of manipulator has mainly focused on the intelligence of their control methods. By combining sensors with visual systems, Manipulator can achieve environmental perception and target recognition, improving their ability to adapt to different scenarios and tasks. In this study, the UR5e robot arm is used to obtain the visual environment information through depth camera processing, and the Faster R-CNN algorithm is used to extract the image object and its position. The speech and other human natural language information is processed into semantic embedding vectors through the GloVe algorithm. After the fusion of the image and language information, the information is mapped to the motion control instructions of the robot arm, and the various states and control parameters of the robot arm at each moving moment in the future are obtained, to achieve the task of the robot arm language control to grab and place specific objects.},

abstract = {Human motion tracking is of great significance for sports training and rehabilitation treatment. Wearable sensors are the preferred device for motion detection, but they often have characteristics such as high cost and poor wearing comfort. In order to address this issue, this paper presented a capacitive strain sensor based on smart conductive fabrics for measuring arm joint posture during shooting actions. We modeled the elbow joint and established a model of a capacitive sensor. We tested the proposed sensor, and then conducted real-time shooting motion capture experiments. The proposed sensor's capacitance value is 57.97 pF, gauge factor is 2.3. And within the range of 0-120° bending angle variation, the capacitance variation is 0-25.2 pF. This sensor exhibits good linearity and corresponding speed in arm joint capture. And Which is expected to be applied to high-level sports training and rehabilitation training.},

abstract = {In autonomous robotic systems, the parallel processing of multiple tasks often competes for limited resources, affecting system performance and the robot’s responsiveness to environmental changes. Traditional computational task scheduling methods often overlook the dynamic nature of task priorities in autonomous robotic systems, where task importance can shift based on interactions with the external environment. Therefore, there’s a crucial need for a mechanism capable of adaptively adjusting task scheduling in response to environmental changes, ensuring timely access to resources for critical tasks. To address this challenge, this study presents Priorest, a neural network model that incorporates multimodal data processing and multitask learning. Priorest integrates sensor data with logs monitoring computational device performance to predict events influencing task priority, enabling task adjustments while preserving essential resource allocations. When deployed in autonomous robotic systems, Priorest’s event-prediction-based adjustment strategy reduced critical task completion times by 18.7\%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of Priorest in enhancing parallel task scheduling.},

abstract = {With the advancement of communication technology, local user devices encounter computational inadequacy and real-time challenges when handling computationally intensive and latency-sensitive applications. To address this problem, this paper utilizes a UAV loaded with mobile edge devices as an airborne mobile base station to provide task offloading services. It proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based task offloading algorithm. First, the joint decision problem of UAV flight trajectory optimization and task offloading allocation in the task offloading system for UAV-assisted edge computing is modeled as a Markov decision process. The objectives include achieving system latency sensitivity, prioritizing UAV energy efficiency, and ensuring geo-service fairness for user devices. Secondly, considering that the problem is a non-convex optimization problem with multiple constraints, for the complexity of the solution process and the continuity of the prediction action, this paper adopts the TD3 (Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) algorithm to solve this complex problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm proposed in this paper can significantly decrease system latency and UAV energy consumption in a complex and variable system environment. It also enhances geographic fairness and offers a more efficient and equitable offloading service for user devices.},

In this study, a general mixed integer multi-objective nonlinear programming model is developed to minimize costs, environmental impact, and delays that can be used by project managers to generate project schedules for a project. Operations research techniques, particularly an algorithm that balances the optimization of the three conflicting objectives, were used for simultaneous optimization. A hypothetical case study is solved to demonstrate the capabilities and highlight the novelty of the proposed model. Finally, two scenario analyses were performed to understand the behaviors of the system under varying conditions. The results of this study show the capabilities of the model in simultaneously considering economic, environmental, and social considerations, especially for time-sensitive projects.},

abstract = {Anecdotal evidence indicates that the swift expansion of supply chains can give rise to significant adverse environmental consequences, primarily attributable to suppliers lacking adequate green capabilities. These repercussions are further compounded by the challenges faced by core enterprises in effectively managing and regulating the environmentally friendly practices of their suppliers. To mitigate this concern, two strategies are gradually adopted in business practice: supplier integration and supplier development. This paper investigates the effects of some critical contextual factors, e.g., the consumer green sensitivity coefficient, the cost parameter of developing green technologies, and the integration cost, on the selection of these two strategies. The results indicate: (I) low levels of consumers' green sensitivity coefficient prompt the manufacturer to integrate the supplier, while high levels of that lead the manufacturer to develop the supplier. (II) When the cost parameter of developing green technology is relatively low, the supplier development strategy is more beneficial to the manufacturer. Otherwise, when the cost parameter is high, the supplier integration strategy becomes more conducive. (III) Through comparative analysis, a threshold for integration cost has been determined. An integration cost below this threshold will lead the manufacturer to choose the supplier integration strategy. Our findings provide new insights into green supply chain literature and management implications for enterprises to formulate effective supplier relationship management strategies.},

abstract = {With the advent of the digital era, hybrid teaching modes blending online and offline components, alongside virtual learning environments, are emerging as the forefront of curriculum delivery and the future of educational spaces. The extensive application of virtual reality technology in design and business domains underscores the maturity and feasibility of multi-scene applications based on Extended Reality (XR) virtual technology. By exploring the potential applications of XR virtual technology in education, this study designs experiments for an integrated virtual and physical teaching space. Through the utilization of 3D multi-scene software, the author conducts simulations of multi-scene designs, integrates physical environment construction, and records and tracks offline teaching activities. The study culminates in the real-time rendering and outputting of teaching content, achieving the goal of creating a virtual multi-scene teaching space. In the context of post-epidemic educational development, the integration of multi-scene simulation and immersive learning experiences offers significant benefits. Such approaches effectively enhance learners' participation, knowledge retention, and self-efficacy. Moreover, a virtual multi-scene environment encompasses a sensory-rich experience, incorporating sight, hearing, touch, and more, thereby seamlessly integrating virtual and physical elements into the teaching process. Looking ahead, the convergence of XR immersive technology and online teaching platforms holds the promise of streamlining physical space utilization, thereby saving time, manpower, and material costs, while providing students with immersive on-site learning experiences.},

abstract = {Edge intelligence has been gaining traction and sophistication. The execution settings may range from a small cluster as an edge cloud to on-device inference on embedded devices, differing in hardware capability over orders of magnitude. The application scenarios for edge data analytics increasingly involve multimodal sensory input (e.g., combining audio, video, and text input) for richer contextual understanding. However, there is insufficient system support to handle the growing complexity and heterogeneity in edge analytics. Application development and deployment still require substantial domain knowledge of both multimodal inference and myriad execution environments.This paper presents Crystal, a framework to ease edge analytics development and deployment over diverse edge settings. Crystal presents developers with configuration interfaces to use built-in or custom libraries for common analytics modules and then compiles the application code. Internally, Crystal masks hardware heterogeneity with abstract resource types through containerization, while abstracting away application processing pipelines into generic flow graphs. On this basis, Crystal then supports a notion of degradable computing that adjusts the application flow to fit the available resource and streamlines the analytics processing by elimination modality redundancy. Crystal further interfaces with existing machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow) and containerization and orchestration tools (Docker and Kubernetes). Building atop Crystal reduces the application development effort by a factor of 10 in terms of lines of code; Meanwhile, Crystal automatically and gracefully adapts to settings from a Raspberry Pi to a small EC2 cluster, without manual effort or significant loss of analytics quality.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, machine learning has gained significant traction and is now deployed across diverse domains, including information systems, finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, autonomous driving, and more. As machine learning finds applications in various sensitive scenarios, the demand for models that exhibit accuracy and robustness during the operational phase has grown exponentially. One crucial factor that profoundly shapes the quality of machine learning models revolves around the training data they rely upon and the input data encountered at the operational phase. Therefore, the development of data-aware algorithms is of paramount importance in achieving high-quality machine-learning models. This thesis contributes to this overarching objective by delving into the development of data-aware algorithms, emphasizing the importance of this awareness during both the training and operational phases of machine learning models. The research presented in this thesis focuses on two primary domains. The first domain is information retrieval, with a particular emphasis on enhancing both the efficiency of learning-to-rank learning algorithms and the effectiveness of the learned models in solving ranking tasks. The thesis includes three works in this domain: Marcuzzi et al. [2022] provides a novel algorithm to detect and remove consistent-outliers documents from the training data. In Marcuzzi et al. [2023], we designed a new learning algorithm that handles the problem of gradient incoherencies affecting LambdaRank-based algorithms. Finally, in Lucchese et al. [2023], we designed a new sampling function for the Selective Gradient Boosting algorithm to exploit the most useful low-ranked non-relevant document. The second domain is adversarial machine learning, which focuses on increasing the robustness of binary classifiers against adversarial inputs encountered at the operational phase. Furthermore, the research in this domain focuses on providing certifiable models to efficiently assess robustness against adversarial machine learning attacks. In this regard, in Calzavara et al. [2021], we designed a novel robust learning algorithm to train ensembles of decision trees robust to evasion attacks along with its polynomial robustness-certification algorithm designed to compute a robustness lower bound. Finally, in Calzavara et al. [2022], we provided a new evaluation metric named Resilience to better access the security of machine learning models.Awarded by: Universit\`{a} Ca' Foscari di Venezia, Venice, Italy on 19 April 2024.Supervised by: Claudio Lucchese.Available at: https://federicomarcuzzi.github.io/resources/thesis_phd.pdf.},

abstract = {Since the birth of drone technology in the 1920s, its aerospace value, measurement value, and military value have been fully recognized. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the application of drones in disaster management, with a particular focus on fire incidents. We build upon a previously established Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model developed by our team [1], enhancing it to optimize the monitoring area radius, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of drones in emergency response and disaster relief operations. The research investigates the sensitivity of monitoring area radius and delves into the impact of environmental factors such as terrain and weather on drone performance. It further explores the strategic deployment of Emergency Operation Centers (EOCs) and the use of repeater drones to extend communication ranges. The core contributions of this paper lie in the development of an innovative drone deployment strategy that improves response times and increases the overall safety and effectiveness of disaster management efforts. Through real-world case studies, including the fire incidents in Australia, we demonstrate the practical advantages of our proposed solutions and discuss the potential for future applications in various disaster scenarios.},

In order to timely extract useful information from the massive multi-source data accumulated on the operation and maintenance platform, this paper proposes an engineering multidimensional data management framework based on spatial data warehouse. Based on the spatial data characteristics generated during the engineering operation and maintenance period, a multidimensional data cube was established, and the conceptual, logical, and physical models of multidimensional data were designed. A spatial data warehouse system integrating, analyzing, mining, and displaying multidimensional data was proposed, providing an analytical decision support environment for massive data mining and analysis during the engineering operation and maintenance period, and a unified data resource management framework for subsequent intelligent operation and maintenance management applications.},

abstract = {Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) applications perform Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to determine the position of the camera and generate a map of the environment, enabling the overlay of virtual objects onto the real world. Since real world environments are often dynamic, some algorithms have been developed to deal with mobile objects. However, these dynamic SLAM algorithms are either computation-intensive or rely on additional sensors such as depth sensors or lasers, making them impractical to be used for MAR on smartphones. In this work, we aim to reduce the time of a dynamic SLAM algorithm on resource-constrained mobile devices. To this end, we reduce the number of frames on which dynamic object detection is performed by leveraging temporal correlation between consecutive frames. In addition, we use geometric clustering that identifies moving clusters by determining the outliers through epipolar and homographic transformations. We evaluated our method on a public dataset and showed that our method can complete 100X faster than the state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM algorithm DynaSLAM while maintaining comparable accuracy.},

abstract = {Visibility could potentially signify attentiveness. Estimating the line of sight is crucial in numerous fields, including computer vision, human-computer interaction, and psychology. Estimating the line of sight is crucial in numerous fields, including computer vision, human-computer interaction, and psychology. Line of sight estimation is difficult to achieve due to changes in head position and advancements in precision. This article examines domestic and international research and methodologies for developing a three-eye, eight-light source system and fusing head-eye motion data using deep convolution neural dynamics. What followed transpired. Analysis of line of sight characteristics consists of the pupil center, eye image, and pulchin spot center. The irises of humans are identified via face detection. The tracking of the pulchin spot center, face identification, eye image, and pupil center is accomplished through the utilization of a non-wearable three-eye eight light source system, Haar feature, AdaBoost algorithm, and ASM algorithm. To distinguish faces, ASM monitors face feature points in the wide field image and intercepts the human eye image. In order to improve line of sight, this article employs a convolutional neural network to arbitrarily identify faces on-screen. Three random screen orientations result in a classification accuracy of 99\% for facial images. The pupil position for the front-facing eye is estimated by a Dual Haar-like feature extractor, followed by the estimation of the pupil center using morphological pixel model and ellipse fitting. Reflection of the purchin Purchin Point is located by a Canny edge detection operator and search algorithm subsequent to threshold processing of the image. In conclusion, the centroid method yields the center coordinates and line of sight of the purchin point. The feature extraction data for head posture presented in this article comprises the following in space axis coordinates: roll, pitch, yaw angle, three-axis position, and speed. Utilize image-based head position evaluation and inertial sensors. Utilizing acceleration interpolation, Picard approximation, and four-order Runge Kutta integral methods, the rotation quaternion is integrated. For tracking purposes, the acceleration interpolation integral converts a head posture quaternion to a rotation angle. Using a face model transformation tailored to the facial feature, the image approach subsequently transforms three-dimensional attributes into two-dimensional space. In order to account for the angle of head posture, the image approach modifies the depth parameters of the model subsequent to converting three-dimensional features to two-dimensional space via facial feature points. Using these two methods, head motion quantification can be enhanced.},

The traditional OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) loop provides a framework for combating process analysis, but in complex and dynamic environments, collaboration among diverse stakeholders becomes essential. This paper proposes a collaborative OODA (Colla-OODA) model for military combating process analysis. The Colla-OODA model integrates collaboration into each phase of the decision-making process, emphasizing the importance of information sharing, collective analysis, and synchronized action among military units, branches, and allied forces. Sensor fusion plays a central role in enhancing situational awareness by integrating data from various sources such as satellites, drones, ground sensors, and intelligence reports. Through advanced data processing and fusion algorithms, the Colla-OODA model aims to provide decision-makers with a holistic view of the operational environment, enabling more accurate assessments and rapid response to emerging threats and opportunities. The Colla-OODA model is evaluated through comprehensive modeling and simulation analyses, considering factors such as decision-making speed, accuracy, and agility in dynamic scenarios. The findings of this study will contribute to the development of innovative approaches to military decision-making, with potential applications in future battlefield operations and strategic planning efforts.},

abstract = {In IoT applications, embedded devices acquire and transmit data to control and optimize industrial processes. To trust this data, the data acquisition system, such as the sensors and the integrated signal processing components itself must be trusted. Approaches like hardware fingerprinting try to improve the overall security of such systems. In this paper, we review and systematize current research and trends in hardware fingerprinting. We provide insights to current research directions by reviewing multiple survey and review papers and derive a common definition for fingerprinting based on the reviewed literature. We identify three different fingerprinting techniques: hardware fingerprinting, behavior fingerprinting and radio frequency fingerprinting. By decomposing a generalized embedded system architecture, we provide four trust domains from which we can create a hardware fingerprint: main processing domain, on-device communication domain, peripheral domain and environmental domain. With the trust domains in place, a new fingerprinting taxonomy is developed, taking into account different data sources and evaluation techniques. We distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic data sources and direct and indirect data evaluation. To understand the scope of fingerprinting techniques in terms of their trust domain and application scenarios, a new categorization model is created that ties the data sources to a physical asset of the device, making it possible to determine to what extend a device’s components can be trusted and in which applications it may be applicable.},

abstract = {Attacks on embedded devices continue to evolve with the increasing number of applications in actual products. A trusted execution environment (TEE) enhances the security of embedded devices by isolating and protecting sensitive applications such as cryptography from malicious or vulnerable applications. However, the emergence of TEE bypass attacks using faults exposes TEEs to threats. In CHES’22, jump address masking (JAM) was proposed as a countermeasure against TEE bypass attacks, specifically targeting RISC-V. JAM prevents modifications of protected data by calculating jump addresses using the protected data, and is expected to provide promising resistance to TEE bypass attacks, for which traditional countermeasures are ineffective. However, JAM was originally proposed for bare metal applications. Therefore, its application to TEEs that operate with an OS presents technical and security challenges. This study proposes a method for applying JAM to Keystone, a major TEE framework for RISC-V, and validates its practical effectiveness and performance through a comparative evaluation with existing countermeasures such as memory encryption, random delays, and instruction duplication. Our evaluation reveals that the proposed JAM implementation is the first countermeasure that achieves complete resistance to TEE bypass attacks with an execution time overhead of approximately 340\% for context switches and 1.0\% across the entire program, which is acceptable compared with other countermeasures.},

abstract = {Sensors embedded in mobile smart devices can monitor users’ activity with high accuracy to provide a variety of services to end-users ranging from precise geolocation, health monitoring, and handwritten word recognition. However, this involves the risk of accessing and potentially disclosing sensitive information of individuals to the apps that may lead to privacy breaches. In this paper, we aim to minimize privacy leakages that may lead to user identification on mobile devices through user tracking and distinguishability while preserving the functionality of apps and services. We propose a privacy-preserving mechanism that effectively handles the sensor data fluctuations (e.g., inconsistent sensor readings while walking, sitting, and running at different times) by formulating the data as time-series modeling and forecasting. The proposed mechanism uses correlated noise-series against noise filtering attacks from an adversary, which aims to filter out the noise from the perturbed data to re-identify the original data. Unlike existing solutions, our mechanism keeps running in isolation without the interaction of a user or a service provider. We perform rigorous experiments on three benchmark datasets and show that our proposed mechanism limits user tracking and distinguishability threats to a significant extent compared to the original data while maintaining a reasonable level of utility of functionalities. In general, we show that our obfuscation mechanism reduces the user trackability threat by 60\% across all the datasets while maintaining the utility loss below 0.3 Mean Absolute Error (MAE). More specifically, we observe that 80\% of users achieve a 100\% untrackability rate in the Swipes dataset across all noise scales. In the handwriting dataset, distinguishability is 17\% for 60\% of the users. Overall, our mechanism provides a utility error (MAE) of only 0.12 for 60\% of users, and this increases to 0.2 for 100\% users when correction thresholds are altered.},

abstract = {This paper explores the critical aspects of behavioural modelling for sustainability in smart homes, emphasising the integration of advanced technologies to enhance energy efficiency, convenience, security, and overall quality of life. Smart homes utilise interconnected devices and sensors to collect detailed data on residents’ behaviours, energy usage, and environmental conditions. Predictive analytics, leveraging machine learning algorithms and data mining techniques, optimises home systems by anticipating residents’ needs and promoting efficient energy use. Behavioural interventions, such as real-time feedback, automation, incentives, and nudges, influence residents’ actions toward more sustainable practices. However, privacy concerns about data collection, unauthorised access, and data misuse present challenges. Addressing these issues through robust security measures, transparent policies, and user education is crucial. Additionally, promoting adoption and user engagement requires highlighting the perceived benefits, affordability, ease of use, and trusted brands while overcoming barriers like privacy concerns, technological complexity, and lack of awareness. Practical strategies to enhance adoption and engagement include education campaigns, financial incentives, user-friendly design, robust customer support, and community building. By addressing these factors, smart home technologies can become integral to modern living, contributing to a more sustainable and efficient future. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current and future directions in smart home sustainability, highlighting the interplay between technology, policy, and user engagement to shape research directions and foster a sustainable and efficient future.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a significant role in our daily lives as interconnection and automation positively impact our societal needs. In contrast to traditional devices, IoT devices require connectivity and data sharing to operate effectively. This interaction necessitates that data resides on multiple platforms and often across different locations, posing challenges from a digital forensic investigator's perspective. Recovering a full trail of data requires piecing together elements from various devices and locations. IoT-based forensic investigations include an increasing quantity of objects of forensic interest, the uncertainty of device relevance in terms of digital artifacts or potential data, blurry network boundaries, and edgeless networks, each of which poses new challenges for the identification of significant forensic artifacts. One example of the positive societal impact of IoT devices is that of Humanoid robots, with applications in public spaces such as assisted living, medical facilities, and airports. These robots use IoT to provide varying functionality but rely heavily on supervised learning to customize their utilization of the IoT to various environments. A humanoid robot can be a rich source of sensitive data about individuals and environments, and this data may assist in digital investigations, delivering additional information during a crime investigation. In this paper, we present our case study on the Zenbo Humanoid Robot, exploring how Zenbo could be a witness to a crime. In our experiments, a forensic examination was conducted on the robot to locate all useful evidence from multiple locations, including root-level directories using logical acquisition.},

abstract = {Environmental monitoring systems have become increasingly popular among everyday people and scientists to focus on the abnormal global environmental changes that lead to global warming and influence human living geographies. In recent times, the rapid advancement of wireless networks and widespread use of wireless sensors have increased, eventually leading to the mass production and affordability of diverse sensor technologies. With these advancements, monitoring air quality, weather conditions, and pollution levels has become more accessible for everyone. A wide range of sensors is now available, ranging from basic models to sophisticated ones capable of measuring specific pollutants or environmental parameters. Therefore, these systems have witnessed widespread adoption among both individuals and researchers. In this study, we proposed a system for environmental monitoring that allows users to visualize the data from anywhere over the internet. It also permits users to use the optimal display to customize the historical and real-time data metrics insights in a detailed view to accommodate their precise preferences and requirements. As a result, an environmental monitoring system is developed that can efficiently visualize and analyze large amounts of diverse sensors data, accessible to users.‘ This paper presents an IoT system designed to seamlessly integrate IoT into edge-to-cloud systems, prioritizing enhanced system security, responsiveness, meticulous data management, and IoT connectivity. The characteristics of the proposed system integrate Hardware, Network, and Software configurations to easily perform environmental monitoring on a web app through the internet without being restricted by time or location.},

abstract = {The smart wearable device industry is growing fast, with devices being used more in healthcare, sports, and entertainment. These devices use micro-sensors to collect data, which is sent to the Internet for analysis and display. This study looks at how artificial intelligence is used in brain-computer interface (BCI) research for smart wearables and found:1. For better accuracy in short time periods, the right stimulation method is key. An AR-BCI system using SSVEP was developed, which resulted in an average online recognition rate of 88.67\% with 1 second of data and 98.6\% with 2 seconds.2. Monitoring brain activity relies on capturing action potentials outside neurons, with EEG being captured at 2048 Hz for better accuracy and reduced data processing.3. The EEG shows high quality signals, needing minimal preprocessing for high classification accuracy. The MSCNN-SVN model shows an analysis efficiency of 10.2, with the MSCNN model at 12.3, and the SVM model at 35.2. The MSCNN-SVN model has low error rates and high efficiency.},

This case report demonstrates the use of two popular sensors, the Dexcom G6 and the Abbot Freestyle Libre 2, for continuous blood glucose measurement in a woman diagnosed with arterial hypertension, without other chronic diseases or complications. Daytime post-meal measurements were found to be higher with the Abbot Freestyle Libre 2, but nighttime measurements were lower. In the future, it is important to investigate the influence of different environmental factors on the values. The Dexcom G6 sensor showed unusual dips and jumps in night-time plasma glucose measurements. Therefore, further investigations on the effect of sleep position and compression of the sensor site on glucose values are needed.},

abstract = {The escalating demand for manufacturing and transportation of goods underscores the imperative for continuous advancements in storage systems to enhance space and labor efficiency. In response to the growing needs of industries, storage solutions must undergo ongoing development to keep pace with the dynamic landscape of production and logistics. Optimizing space utilization becomes paramount as the volume of goods being manufactured and transported surges. The autonomous warehouse model was created as a method to intelligently arrange goods to conserve space and boost working speed. The AutoStore system, a cube-shaped warehouse, is operated entirely by robots. In this scientific research, we propose the application of a series of algorithms to manage the behaviors of robots within an AutoStore system. These behaviors include path-finding and object manipulation (dragging and dropping), aimed at efficiently maneuvering the entry and retrieval of items from the warehouse. The research addresses a set of robot behaviors for application in the AutoStore system. Constructing an AutoStore system demands optimization in managing robot behaviors, by using Hierarchical Finite State Machine(HFSM). We apply the D* Lite path-finding algorithm to find the initial path, update it locally based on inputs from the ultrasonic sensor, and then submit the path to the server. By focusing on behavior optimization, we aim to enhance the efficiency of automated inventory management. The outcomes of this research hold the potential for implementation in a practical AutoStore system, aiding in the optimal utilization of storage space and maximizing operational efficiency. This research focuses on both establishing fundamental robot behaviors in the AutoStore system and optimizing these behaviors, thereby refining and advancing the overall system.},

abstract = {The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to an escalation in security vulnerabilities, particularly concerning botnet attacks. Securing IoT networks against botnet threats is paramount to preserving network integrity and safeguarding sensitive data. Despite advancements in security measures, traditional methods often fall short in effectively detecting and mitigating botnet activity in IoT environments. There is a pressing need for robust and adaptive detection mechanisms capable of accurately identifying botnet behavior amidst the complexity of IoT network traffic. This research addresses the challenge of botnet detection in IoT networks, aiming to develop an effective and scalable solution that can accurately discern between benign and IoT botnets. To address this problem, we propose the use of ensemble learning techniques for the IoT botnet detection. Leveraging the N-BaIoT dataset, which offers real-world IoT traffic data, we apply the Voting Classifier to nine distinct IoT devices and evaluate its performance against key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ensemble approach, achieving high accuracy with an average accuracy rate of 99.3\%. Furthermore, the ensemble method exhibits strong precision, recall, and F1 scores across various IoT device types, underscoring its efficacy in accurately discerning botnet activity. This research contributes to the advancement of botnet detection in IoT networks by introducing an ensemble-based approach that offers robust and adaptive detection capabilities. Our findings highlight the potential of ensemble learning techniques in enhancing security measures in IoT environments.},

In these cases, the edge device must be designed with fault tolerance as a primary objective. FKeras is a tool that helps design fault-tolerant edge neural networks (NNs) that run entirely on chip to meet strict latency and resource requirements. FKeras provides metrics that give a bit-level ranking of NN weights with respect to their sensitivity to faults. FKeras includes these sensitivity metrics to guide efficient fault injection campaigns to help evaluate the robustness of an NN architecture. We show how to use FKeras in the codesign of edge NNs trained on the high-granularity endcap calorimeter dataset, which represents high energy physics data, as well as the CIFAR-10 dataset. We use FKeras to analyze an NN’s fault tolerance to consider alongside its accuracy, performance, and resource consumption. The results show that the different NN architectures have vastly differing resilience to faults. FKeras can also determine how to protect NN weights best, e.g., by selectively using triple modular redundancy on only the most sensitive weights, which reduces area without affecting accuracy.},

abstract = {We present a sensor that can measure light and wirelessly communicate the measurement, without the need for an external power source or a battery. Our sensor, called cricket, harvests energy from incident light. It is asleep for most of the time and transmits a short and strong radio frequency chirp when its harvested energy reaches a specific level. The carrier frequency of each cricket is fixed and reveals its identity, and the duration between consecutive chirps is a measure of the incident light level. We have characterized the radiometric response function, signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range of cricket. We have experimentally verified that cricket can be miniaturized at the expense of increasing the duration between chirps. We show that a cube with a cricket on each of its sides can be used to estimate the centroid of any complex illumination, which has value in applications such as solar tracking. We also demonstrate the use of crickets for creating untethered sensor arrays that can produce video and control lighting for energy conservation. Finally, we modified cricket's circuit to develop battery-free electronic sunglasses that can instantly adapt to environmental illumination.},

abstract = {Genetic studies indicate that more than 50\% of women are genetically tetrachromatic, expressing four distinct types of color photoreceptors (cone cells) in the retina. At least one functional tetrachromat has been identified in laboratory tests. We hypothesize that there is a large latent group in the population capable of fundamentally richer color experience, but we are not yet aware of this group because of a lack of tetrachromatic colors in the visual environment. This paper develops theory and engineering practice for fabricating tetrachromatic colors and potentially identifying tetrachromatic color vision in the wild. First, we apply general d-dimensional color theory to derive and compute all the key color structures of human tetrachromacy for the first time, including its 4D space of possible object colors, 3D space of chromaticities, and yielding a predicted 2D sphere of tetrachromatic hues. We compare this predicted hue sphere to the familiar hue circle of trichromatic color, extending the theory to predict how the higher dimensional topology produces an expanded color experience for tetrachromats. Second, we derive the four reflectance functions for the ideal tetrachromatic inkset, analogous to the well-known CMY printing basis for trichromacy. Third, we develop a method for prototyping tetrachromatic printers using a library of fountain pen inks and a multi-pass inkjet printing platform. Fourth, we generalize existing color tests - sensitive hue ordering tests and rapid isochromatic plate screening tests - to higher-dimensional vision, and prototype variants of these tests for identifying and characterizing tetrachromacy in the wild.},

abstract = {While camera-based capture systems remain the gold standard for recording human motion, learning-based tracking systems based on sparse wearable sensors are gaining popularity. Most commonly, they use inertial sensors, whose propensity for drift and jitter have so far limited tracking accuracy. In this paper, we propose Ultra Inertial Poser, a novel 3D full body pose estimation method that constrains drift and jitter in inertial tracking via inter-sensor distances. We estimate these distances across sparse sensor setups using a lightweight embedded tracker that augments inexpensive off-the-shelf 6D inertial measurement units with ultra-wideband radio-based ranging—dynamically and without the need for stationary reference anchors. Our method then fuses these inter-sensor distances with the 3D states estimated from each sensor. Our graph-based machine learning model processes the 3D states and distances to estimate a person’s 3D full body pose and translation. To train our model, we synthesize inertial measurements and distance estimates from the motion capture database AMASS. For evaluation, we contribute a novel motion dataset of 10 participants who performed 25 motion types, captured by 6 wearable IMU+UWB trackers and an optical motion capture system, totaling 200 minutes of synchronized sensor data (UIP-DB). Our extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance for our method over PIP and TIP, reducing position error from 13.62 to 10.65&nbsp;cm (22\% better) and lowering jitter from 1.56 to 0.055&nbsp;km/s3 (a reduction of 97\%).  &nbsp; UIP code, UIP-DB dataset, and hardware design: https://github.com/eth-siplab/UltraInertialPoser},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a low-budget and high-authenticity bidirectional telepresence system, Tele-Aloha, targeting peer-to-peer communication scenarios. Compared to previous systems, Tele-Aloha utilizes only four sparse RGB cameras, one consumer-grade GPU, and one autostereoscopic screen to achieve high-resolution (2048x2048), real-time (30 fps), low-latency (less than 150ms) and robust distant communication. As the core of Tele-Aloha, we propose an efficient novel view synthesis algorithm for upper-body. Firstly, we design a cascaded disparity estimator for obtaining a robust geometry cue. Additionally a neural rasterizer via Gaussian Splatting is introduced to project latent features onto target view and to decode them into a reduced resolution. Further, given the high-quality captured data, we leverage weighted blending mechanism to refine the decoded image into the final resolution of 2K. Exploiting world-leading autostereoscopic display and low-latency iris tracking, users are able to experience a strong three-dimensional sense even without any wearable head-mounted display device. Altogether, our telepresence system demonstrates the sense of co-presence in real-life experiments, inspiring the next generation of communication.},

abstract = {The demanding need to perform privacy-preserving computations among multiple         data owners has led to the prosperous development of secure multi-party         computation (MPC) protocols. MPC offers protocols for parties to jointly compute         a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. To date, MPC         has been widely adopted in various real-world, privacy-sensitive sectors, such         as healthcare and finance. Moreover, to ease the adoption of MPC, industrial and academic         MPC compilers have been developed to automatically translate         programs describing arbitrary MPC procedures into low-level MPC executables.                 Compiling high-level descriptions into high-efficiency MPC executables is         challenging: the compilation often involves converting high-level languages into         several intermediate representations (IR), e.g., arithmetic or boolean circuits,         optimizing the computation/communication cost, and picking proper MPC protocols (and         underlying virtual machines) for a particular task and threat model. Various         optimizations and heuristics are employed during the compilation procedure to         improve the efficiency of the generated MPC executables.                 Despite the prosperous adoption of MPC compilers by industrial vendors and         academia, a principled and systematic understanding of the correctness of         MPC compilers does not yet exist. To fill this critical gap, this paper         introduces MT-MPC, a metamorphic testing (MT) framework specifically designed for         MPC compilers to effectively uncover erroneous compilations. Our approach         proposes three metamorphic relations (MRs) that are tailored for MPC programs to         mutate high-level MPC programs (compiler inputs). We then examine if MPC         compilers yield semantics-equivalent MPC executables regarding the original and         mutated MPC programs by comparing their execution results.                Real-world MPC compilers exhibit a high level of engineering quality.         Nevertheless, we detected 4,772 inputs that can result in erroneous         compilations in three popular MPC compilers available on the market. While the         discovered error-triggering inputs do not cause the MPC compilers to crash         directly, they can lead to the generation of incorrect MPC executables,         jeopardizing the underlying dependability of the computation.         With substantial manual effort and help from the MPC compiler developers, we         uncovered thirteen bugs in these MPC compilers by debugging them using the         error-triggering inputs. Our proposed testing frameworks and findings can be         used to guide developers in their efforts to improve MPC compilers.},

abstract = {The development of the Metaverse offers more possibilities for autonomous driving. This is mainly reflected in the fact that the scene reconstructed based on multiple sensors can help the autonomous vehicle establish a Metaverse world based on its own real situation. When multiple vehicles build such a Metaverse world in the same scene, they can exchange their information including the perception of the vehicle’s condition and the surrounding environment, which means the creation of a Metaverse world containing all vehicles. Thus, an indirect Human-Human Multimedia Communications based on the Metaverse is realized, in which the autonomous driving system acts as a multimedia to provide a medium for the exchange of information between vehicles. The establishment of the Metaverse is based on stable and high-quality scene reconstruction. Accurate scene information can bring high quality Human-Human Multimedia Communications. Achieving this requires accurate scene reconstruction and vehicle positioning, both of which depend on accurate point cloud registration. In this work, we propose a robust registration method that is based on semantic information and scaling constraints. Our method consists of three steps. Firstly, we filter out points that might mislead the point cloud registration process by leveraging semantic information. Secondly, we obtain a more accurate initial matrix using TEASER++, which is based on semantic information and feature descriptors. Finally, we use semantic information and scaling to constrain the nearest neighbor matching and filter out error matches to obtain a higher quality registration. By following these steps, our method overcomes the memory problem faced by TEASER++ when there are large-scale point clouds, and greatly reduces its running time. Meanwhile, our algorithm achieved superior point cloud registration results compared to two state-of-the-art robust registration techniques: Globally optimal Iterative Closest Point (Go-ICP) and Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP).},

abstract = {The identification of emotions is an open research area and has a potential leading role in the improvement of socio-emotional skills such as empathy, sensitivity, and emotion recognition in humans. The current study aimed at using Event Related Potential (ERP) components (N100, N200, P200, P300, early Late Positive Potential (LPP), middle LPP, and late LPP) of EEG data for the classification of emotional states (positive, negative, neutral). EEG data were collected from 62 healthy individuals over 18 electrodes. An emotional paradigm with pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) was used to record the EEG data. A linear Support Vector Machine (C = 0.1) was used to classify emotions, and a forward feature selection approach was used to eliminate irrelevant features. The early LPP component, which was the most discriminative among all ERP components, had the highest classification accuracy (70.16\%) for identifying negative and neutral stimuli. The classification of negative versus neutral stimuli had the best accuracy (79.84\%) when all ERP components were used as a combined feature set, followed by positive versus negative stimuli (75.00\%) and positive versus neutral stimuli (68.55\%). Overall, the combined ERP component feature sets outperformed single ERP component feature sets for all stimulus pairings in terms of accuracy. These findings are promising for further research and development of EEG-based emotion recognition systems.},

abstract = {We present CognitIDE, a tool for collecting physiological measurements, mapping them to source code, and visualizing them directly within IntelliJ-based Integrated Development Environments (IDE)s. CognitIDE facilitates the setup and conduction of empirical studies evaluating the relationships between software artifacts and physiological parameters. Corresponding measurements enable researchers to evaluate, for example, the cognitive load software developers are experiencing. Our tool lets study participants use IDEs in a natural way while eye gaze, further body sensor data, and interactions with the IDE are collected. Furthermore, CognitIDE enables highlighting code positions according to the physiological values collected while corresponding positions were looked at. This facilitates the identification of poorly maintainable code and provides a direct way for study participants to reflect on whether the measurements mirror their perception. Moreover, the plugin has additional features for facilitating studies, such as interrupting participants and letting them answer predefined questions. Our tool supports recording measurements with the wide variety of devices supported by the Lab Streaming Layer. Video: https://youtu.be/9yLV5AdTiJw},
