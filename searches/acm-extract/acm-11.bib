abstract = {Accurate prediction of tourist numbers is very important for resource management, service quality improvement, and sustainable tourism development. Understanding tourist flow in advance can optimize economic benefits, reduce environmental pressure, and improve tourist satisfaction. However, the high complexity of tourism data, with significant time dependence and nonlinear dynamic characteristics, poses a great challenge to traditional forecasting methods. To this end, this paper proposes a forecasting framework that combines multiple mechanisms. The framework captures short-term and long-term dependence through time convolution filter, accurately models highly volatile patterns, and adopts Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to maintain the state of key information and improve the sensitivity of the model to dynamic changes. In addition, the self-attention mechanism learns global dependence and allocates attention in long time series, thus improving prediction accuracy and generalization ability. This hierarchical modeling strategy enhances the ability of the model to deal with non-stationary data and better captures complex interactions. Ultimately, the framework provides reliable support for strategic decision-making and lays a solid foundation for promoting the sustainable development of regional tourism.},

abstract = {Objectives: Hepatobiliary cancers, encompassing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as well as malignancies of the biliary tract and gallbladder, represent a major health burden due to their frequent late-stage detection and the scarcity of effective treatment options. This research employs Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore the causal links between specific blood protein ratios and the development of hepatobiliary cancers. Methods: A two-sample MR approach was applied, using genetic variants as instrumental variables to assess causal relationships. Blood protein ratio data for the genome-wide association study (GWAS) were derived from the UK Biobank, and outcome data for hepatobiliary cancers were obtained from the Finnish R11 database. To enhance the reliability of causal inference, five MR methods, including Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) and MR-Egger, were applied. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses were carried out to address and minimize the influence of pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Results: MR analysis identified several significant causal relationships. Protective protein ratios for biliary tract and gallbladder malignancies included CD300E/CLEC6A (OR=0.71, 95\% CI: 0.60-0.84), CD300E/CXCL10 (OR=0.63, 95\% CI: 0.50-0.80), and CD300E/TNFRSF1B (OR=0.79, 95\% CI: 0.70-0.89). For HCC, protective ratios included BSG/CKAP4 (OR=0.70, 95\% CI: 0.58-0.84) and FCRL2/LY9 (OR=0.63, 95\% CI: 0.50-0.78). Risk factors for HCC included CD79B/FCRL2 (OR=1.54, 95\% CI: 1.23-1.94), DAPP1/MGMT (OR=1.65, 95\% CI: 1.27-2.16), and EPHB4/EPHB6 (OR=1.92, 95\% CI: 1.37-2.68). The robustness of the findings was confirmed through sensitivity analyses, which showed no indications of horizontal pleiotropy or significant heterogeneity. Conclusion: This study elucidates the causal impact of specific blood protein ratios on hepatobiliary cancers, highlighting potential biomarkers for early detection and therapeutic targets. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving hepatobiliary cancers and provide a foundation for further research to validate these results and investigate the underlying pathways.},

abstract = {With the increasing awareness of national health, the number of marathon events in China is constantly increasing, and the number of amateur marathon enthusiasts is also growing exponentially. However, they have not received professional training and have a certain pursuit of competition results. In daily training, they are prone to low training efficiency due to unreasonable training plans. This article mainly analyzes the relationship between training volume and sports performance by establishing a mathematical model, in order to develop efficient training plans for marathon enthusiasts and help them achieve better competition results. This article constructs a stationary time series model by visualizing and analyzing some training volume time series graphs, setting LSTM neural network parameters, and using Python for rolling prediction. Some prediction graphs reflect an increasing trend in sports performance in the next month. Through analysis, we conclude that increasing training volume has a promoting effect on improving sports performance, but training volume is not absolutely positively correlated with sports performance. As the amount of training increases, the extent of performance improvement will gradually decrease, and there may even be a plateau period or a decline in performance. Therefore, in the actual training process, attention should be paid to physical load and fatigue index to develop a reasonable training plan in order to achieve maximum training benefits. Finally, error analysis, sensitivity analysis of historical data volume, testing, and improvement were conducted on the ARIMA model based on the above established models.},

abstract = {Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) plays a crucial role in maintaining aging and critical infrastructure, supporting applications such as smart cities and digital twinning. These applications demand machine learning models capable of processing large volumes of real-time sensor data at the network edge. However, existing approaches often neglect the challenges of deploying machine learning models at the edge or are constrained by vendor-specific platforms. This paper introduces a scalable and secure edge-computing reference architecture tailored for data-driven SHM. We share practical insights from deploying this architecture at the Memorial Bridge in New Hampshire, US, referred to as the Living Bridge project. Our solution integrates a commercial data acquisition system with off-the-shelf hardware running an open-source edge-computing platform, remotely managed and scaled through cloud services. To support the development of data-driven SHM systems, we propose a resource consumption benchmarking framework called edgeOps to evaluate the performance of machine learning models on edge devices. We study this framework by collecting resource utilization data for machine learning models typically used in SHM applications on two different edge computing hardware platforms. edgeOps was specifically studied on off-the-shelf Linux and ARM-based edge devices. Our findings demonstrate the impact of platform and model selection on system performance, providing actionable guidance for edge-based SHM system design.},

abstract = {IoT devices comprising single-core ARM Cortex-M micro-controllers were earlier used in simple interfacing boards for different sensors. They have come a long way and currently process sensor data using powerful Machine Learning (ML) models instead of offloading the computation tasks to more powerful devices. The ML boom has successfully penetrated these minuscule edge devices, which have started controlling important aspects of our lives (health and fitness, accessibility, financial transactions, etc.) and environment (smart homes, offices, cars, etc.). However, with increased capability comes increased risk of being attacked with malicious intent, especially because of the numerous vulnerabilities of the ubiquitous Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) links between these IoT devices and the smartphone apps that control them.This paper presents a comprehensive study to analyze what kind of integrity checks, prevalent in embedded security literature using different hardware security features, are practical for these extremely low-compute devices. The goal is to minimally affect the performance of the ML applications, while improving system security by ensuring the integrity of the ML inference code and model. Using recent advances in ARM hardware security features for IoT platforms like cryptographic accelerators, TrustZone, debug watchpoints, etc., we implement and compare across a host of integrity check techniques, using real IoT ML applications on actual hardware platforms.},

abstract = {Batteryless devices are gaining widespread adoption as they eliminate batteries through energy harvesting. This not only reduces electronic waste but also facilitates sensing and monitoring in physically inaccessible or challenging environments, such as implantable devices, smart agriculture, and forests. Thus, batteryless devices are increasingly being integrated into Internet of Things (IoT) environments, such as smart homes, healthcare, and agricultural systems, as well as cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as industrial plants and wearable technologies. In these contexts, batteryless devices often handle privacy-sensitive information and must interact seamlessly and securely with both other batteryless devices and traditional battery-powered devices to share data and perform tasks.In this paper, we first identify the unique security and privacy challenges associated with batteryless devices. We then analyze the existing security and privacy solutions within the IoT and CPS domains, highlighting their limitations when applied to batteryless devices. Lastly, we propose new research directions at the intersection of sensing, IoT, security, and privacy to address the operational requirements of batteryless devices. This paper is an important step forward in protecting the security and privacy of batteryless devices as well as their integration into IoT systems and CPS.},

abstract = {Trajectory prediction aims to estimate an entity’s future path using its current position and historical movement data, benefiting fields like autonomous navigation, robotics, and human movement analytics. Deep learning approaches have become key in this area, utilizing large-scale trajectory datasets to model movement patterns, but face challenges in managing complex spatial dependencies and adapting to dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce TrajLearn, a novel model for trajectory prediction that leverages generative modeling of higher-order mobility flows based on hexagonal spatial representation. TrajLearn predicts the next k steps by integrating a customized beam search for exploring multiple potential paths while maintaining spatial continuity. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of TrajLearn, benchmarking it against leading state-of-the-art approaches and meaningful baselines. The results indicate that TrajLearn achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of up to ~40\% across multiple real-world trajectory datasets. In addition, we evaluated different prediction horizons (i.e., various values of k), conducted resolution sensitivity analysis, and performed ablation studies to assess the impact of key model components. Furthermore, we developed a novel algorithm to generate mixed-resolution maps by hierarchically subdividing hexagonal regions into finer segments within a specified observation area. This approach supports selective detailing, applying finer resolution to areas of interest or high activity (e.g., urban centers) while using coarser resolution for less significant regions (e.g., rural or uninhabited areas), effectively reducing data storage requirements and computational overhead. We promote reproducibility and adaptability by offering complete code, data, and detailed documentation with flexible configuration options for various applications.},

It is the first to achieve egocentric human mesh reconstruction in a multi-view manner. Compared with conventional frontal-view mmWave sensing solutions, it addresses several pain points, such as restricted sensing range, occlusion, and the multipath effect caused by surroundings. To overcome the limited capabilities of the stripped-down mmWave radars (with only one transmit antenna and three receive antennas), we tackle three main challenges and propose a holistic solution, including tailored hardware design, sophisticated signal processing, and a deep neural network optimized for high-dimensional complex point clouds. Extensive evaluation shows that Argus achieves performance comparable to traditional solutions based on high-capability mmWave radars, with an average vertex error of 6.5 cm, solely using stripped-down radars deployed in a multi-view configuration. It presents robustness and practicality across conditions, such as with unseen users and different host devices.},

This paper introduces a novel modular sensing framework for developing real-time, multimodal streetscape applications in smart cities. Prior urban sensing systems predominantly rely either on fixed data modalities or centralized data processing, resulting in limited flexibility, high latency, and superficial privacy protections. In contrast, our framework integrates diverse sensing modalities, including cameras, mobile IMU sensors, and wearables into a unified ecosystem leveraging edge-driven distributed analytics. The proposed modular architecture, supported by standardized APIs and message-driven communication, enables hyper-local sensing and scalable development of responsive pedestrian applications. A concrete application demonstrating multimodal pedestrian tracking is developed and evaluated. It is based on the cross-modal inference module, which fuses visual and mobile IMU sensor data to associate detected entities in the camera domain with their corresponding mobile device. We evaluate our framework's performance in various urban sensing scenarios, demonstrating an online association accuracy of 75\% with a latency of ≈39 milliseconds. Our results demonstrate significant potential for broader pedestrian safety and mobility scenarios in smart cities.},

abstract = {The widespread adoption of autonomous driving systems underscores their potential to solve societal challenges, such as the shortage of drivers for cargo transport. However, ensuring safety calls for data sharing through infrastructure sensors, including traffic signals, by employing the Local Dynamic Map (LDM). Using infrastructure sensors requires official permits, which makes conducting unrestricted research on LDM employing these sensors difficult for everyone. This paper proposes SIM-LDM, an automated LDM generation approach using AWSIM, an autonomous driving simulator. By replacing real sensor data with simulator-derived data, research utilizing LDM can be conducted without the need for real-world environments, and simulator customization allows straightforward adjustment of experimental conditions. The DSMS, developed on the Confluent Platform, allows data retrieval through HTTP or HTTPS and SQL-based queries, standardizing JSON outputs for broad system compatibility. Performance evaluations reveal data from up to 120 vehicles can be processed within 50 ms intervals on a single PC. Integration of the proposed framework with Autoware, an autonomous driving software, confirms its effectiveness, demonstrating a simulation-driven option for the LDM deployment in autonomous driving research.},

abstract = {The rapid growth of wearable devices has opened exciting opportunities for context-aware multi-device collaboration, where multiple devices can provide enhanced user experience tailored to user needs and conditions. However, it also presents a unique challenge of reliably determining whether a set of wearables is being used by the same individual. In real-world scenarios, device sharing, exchanging, or unintended use can cause privacy risks and degraded functionality. Existing solutions primarily rely on accelerometer data to match movement patterns across devices, but they perform poorly during stationary or varied non-repetitive activities. In this paper, we introduce BioQ, a method that unobtrusively detects wearable co-location by generating and matching bio-cues. These bio-cues are generated from on-body wearable sensor data and embedded into a common latent space. Furthermore, when devices share the same sensor types, BioQ can effectively integrate multiple sensor sources to improve cue generation and matching. Experimental results show that BioQ outperforms baselines in bio-cue generation and matching and is resource-effective in model training, inference, and energy use.

abstract = {Learning-based environmental sound recognition has emerged as a crucial method for ultra-low-power environmental monitoring in biological research and city-scale sensing systems. These systems usually operate under limited resources and are often powered by harvested energy in remote areas. Recent efforts in on-device sound recognition suffer from low accuracy due to resource constraints, whereas cloud offloading strategies are hindered by high communication costs. In this work, we introduce ORCA, a novel resource-efficient cloud-assisted environmental sound recognition system on batteryless devices operating over the Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs), targeting wide-area audio sensing applications. We propose a cloud assistance strategy that remedies the low accuracy of on-device inference while minimizing the communication costs for cloud offloading. By leveraging a self-attention-based cloud sub-spectral feature selection method to facilitate efficient on-device inference, ORCA resolves three key challenges for resource-constrained cloud offloading over LPWANs: 1) high communication costs and low data rates, 2) dynamic wireless channel conditions, and 3) unreliable offloading. We implement ORCA on an energy-harvesting batteryless microcontroller and evaluate it in a real world urban sound testbed. Our results show that ORCA outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 80\texttimes{} in energy savings and 220\texttimes{} in latency reduction while maintaining comparable accuracy.},

abstract = {Gait balance is a critical indicator of neurological and neuromuscular conditions, such as stroke and Parkinson's disease. Estimating multiple balance features (e.g., the left/right pressure balance in the forefoot, rearfoot, and entire foot) often provides clinicians with insights that facilitate more strategic and personalized treatment plans. Existing approaches that primarily rely on pressure mats, wearable devices, camera-based systems, or direct clinical observation often impose constraints on user experience, such as discomfort, the need for active participation, and potential privacy issues. In contrast, recent advances have demonstrated that floor vibrations captured by geophone sensors can effectively reflect gait dynamics.In this paper, we introduce a human-centered sensing method for estimating multiple gait balance features using floor vibrations generated by human walking. Our approach is non-intrusive and easily deployable, offering significant user experience advantages compared to traditional methods. The key research challenges in developing this method include: (1) the difficulty of capturing the complex relationships between floor vibrations and gait characteristics, and (2) task interference (i.e., conflicting parameter updates when simultaneously estimating multiple gait balance features). To address the first challenge, we leverage human walking biome-chanics to develop a dual-level self-attention network that captures features representing various gait phases. To mitigate task conflicts in the multi-task model, we design both shared layers and task-specific branches in our neural network model, enabling it to extract common features while preserving task-specific characteristics. We evaluated our system through real-world walking experiments with 14 participants. Our system achieved a gait balance classification accuracy of 98.1\% and improved total pressure estimation by about 16\% over baseline methods. This demonstrates that our human-centered balance estimation system provides reliable results while being user-friendly.},

However, existing mmWave-based systems require placement at chest height, which reduces mobility performance and requires user compliance. Head-mounted devices---such as smart glasses, headphones, and helmets---offer a wearable alternative but introduce challenges related to sensor positioning, distance variations, and obstruction effects. This study investigates the feasibility of using head-mounted mmWave radar for HR and RR monitoring. To assess waveform quality beyond statistical accuracy, we introduce VITAL-KL, a novel metric that quantifies differences in signal morphology. Results show that front-facing placements achieve higher signal similarity with reference signals, whereas back-facing positions suffer from degraded performance due to reduced chest motion detection. Despite these variations, HR accuracy remains high, reaching approximately 97\% for standing and 93\% for sitting, as peak-based detection remains robust against waveform distortions. These findings validate the feasibility of head-mounted mmWave radar for vital sign monitoring and provide insights into optimizing sensor placement in wearable sensing systems.},

abstract = {As embodied AI gradually transitions into practical applications, enhancing the fidelity of how embodied agents perceive the physical world has become a critical challenge. Current perception methods typically rely on computer vision-based fiducial marker systems, which suffer from limitations such as insufficient reading distance, poor localization accuracy, and high susceptibility to environmental lighting conditions. Currently, SPAD sensor-based LiDAR technology is emerging in commercial mobile devices due to its compact size, high precision, and low power consumption. This paper presents the design of the RetroLiDAR system, which chimes with the concept of backscatter in wireless technology, to create a liquid-crystal fiducial marker system that can be directly read by LiDAR. On the marker side, we use retroreflective materials to reflect the LiDAR's emitted light back and employ a liquid crystal modulator to adjust the intensity of the light signal. On the LiDAR end, we design a signal processing pipeline to demodulate the marker's modulation message using the temporal received signal strength. Experimental results from our prototype demonstrate that compared to visual fiducial markers, RetroLiDAR extends the reading distance by 2.6x compared to QR codes and by 44\% compared to AprilTags, while reducing the median ranging error by 85\%. We also present a low-power marker circuit design, a link budget analysis, and two proof-of-concept applications to validate the system's efficacy and practicality.},

abstract = {We propose "DUal-NET", a novel transformer-based model for enhancing speech capture through bone conduction headsets in human-centered sensing systems. As wearable bone-conduction devices become increasingly important for continuous health monitoring and ambient computing, they face a unique challenge: bone-conduction microphones can receive significant interference from speakers playing audio to the user, this occurs because the headset is directly in contact with the skull and induces vibrations similar to human speech, much like a user speaking, degrading speech recognition accuracy and communication quality. Existing state-of-art speech enhancement and sound source separation methods are 'blind' and assume that the interference noise is not available due to the inherent difficulty in observing clean correlated noise. By contrast, headsets have full knowledge of the sounds they play through their speakers, and DUal-NET takes advantage of this raw signal in its denoising process. We demonstrate that DUal-NET can significantly improve standard speech quality metrics over existing state-of-art methods in realistic scenarios (PESQ: 135\%, STOI: 50\%, LSD: 66\%), enabling more accurate speech sensing for human-centered applications including health monitoring, personalized assistants, and augmented communication.},

abstract = {Software-defined vehicles (SDVs) rely on cameras for intelligent and safety-critical applications but face challenges from dynamic environmental noise, including weather and occlusions. Unlike static sensors, SDV cameras encounter noise patterns influenced by driving speed, a factor often overlooked in prior research. To address this gap, we conduct a quantitative analysis of the in-transit noise impact using data from public datasets, the CARLA simulator, a robotic vehicle, and a real vehicle. Our findings suggest that maintaining a speed below 40km/h may serve as a threshold for ensuring reliable camera-based applications under noisy urban conditions. In addition, we propose TransitNet, a novel model designed to mitigate in-transit camera noise and enhance driving safety, particularly at higher speeds. Compared to multiple baselines, experimental results show that TransitNet improves the F-measure by 5.1\%, mAP@50 by 3.6\%, and increases FPS by 56.7\% across all datasets. We also provide detailed observations and insights from extensive testing.},

This paper presents UMusic, a novel in-car occupancy sensing system that reuses the ultra-wideband (UWB) devices already installed for access control in modern vehicles. However, due to the compact size and metal structure, the in-car environment is full of reflected propagation paths, which cannot be precisely resolved even with UWB's wide-bandwidth feature. To overcome this challenge, UMusic introduces a reflected-path decomposition technique to extract a high-resolution power delay profile (PDP) from the channel impulse response (CIR) provided by commodity UWB devices, enabling precise environmental perception. By comparing PDPs in empty and occupied conditions, UMusic is able to detect the occupancy status in both a sedan and an SUV with multiple passengers across various scenarios. Our results show that UMusic achieves a 90.2\% detection rate using a single CIR measurement collected within 50 ms, outperforming the state-of-the-art by 15.7\%. When aggregating six consecutive CIR measurements, UMusic reaches 99.4\% accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-world deployment.},

The head-to-head comparison with a non-sensor-informed agent across five use scenarios demonstrates that this sensor-in-the-loop design can effectively improve users' needs and their overall experience. The deep-dive into agents' replies and participants' feedback further reveals that sensor-in-the-loop agents not only provide more contextually relevant responses but also exhibit a better understanding of user priorities and situational nuances. In addition, we conduct two case studies to examine the potential pitfalls and distill key insights from this sensor-in-the-loop agent.

abstract = {Respiration waveforms are increasingly recognized as important biomarkers, offering insights beyond simple respiration rates, such as detecting breathing irregularities for disease diagnosis. Previous works in wireless respiration monitoring have primarily focused on estimating respiration rate, where the breath waveforms are often generated as a by-product. As a result, issues such as waveform deformation and phase inversion have largely been overlooked, reducing the signal's utility for applications requiring breathing waveforms. To address this problem, we present a novel approach, MobiVital, that improves the quality of respiration waveforms obtained from ultra-wideband (UWB) radar data. MobiVital combines a self-supervised autoregressive model for breathing waveform extraction with a biology-informed algorithm to detect and correct waveform inversions. To encourage reproducible research efforts for developing wireless vital signal monitoring systems, we also release a 12-person, 24-hour UWB radar vital signal dataset, with time-synchronized ground truth obtained from wearable sensors. Our results show that the respiration waveforms produced by our system exhibit a 7-34\% increase in fidelity to the ground truth compared to the baselines and can benefit downstream tasks such as respiration rate estimation.},

With the growing prevalence of wearables, smartphones, and IoT devices, vast amounts of human activity data are collected in real-world settings, yet traditional supervised learning approaches require extensive manual labeling, making them impractical for large-scale deployment. Existing deep clustering methods, such as autoencoder-based approaches, often fail to capture temporal dependencies and struggle with noisy sensor readings, leading to suboptimal clustering performance. In contrast, C-PTER integrates pseudo-temporal feature extraction with a parallel CNN-LSTM autoencoder, enabling robust spatial-temporal representation learning. By leveraging compressed feature extraction, our method enhances cluster compactness and inter-cluster separation, significantly improving clustering performance on real-world human activity datasets. We demonstrate that C-PTER outperforms both classical (k-means) and deep clustering baselines (DSC) across three Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) benchmark datasets (MUser, UCI HAR, MHEALTH), achieving up to 30\% improvement in normalized mutual information (NMI) and 21\% in accuracy (ACC). These results validate C-PTER as a scalable and effective solution for clustering unsupervised human behavior.},

This study examines discussions from r/VRchat to explore the reasons for this behavior and how it is perceived within the broader community. Our findings highlight the critical role of mirrors in compensating for the sensory limitations of VR, particularly the lack of physical feedback. Users often turn to mirrors to view parts of their avatar that are not accessible from a first-person perspective. Additionally, our research uncovers that a limited Field-Of-View (FOV) hinders the development of a strong connection between users and their avatars, further driving the need for mirrors. However, while using mirrors to mitigate FOV and physical feedback limitations can be helpful, it may also disrupt social interaction in VR environments, as the excessive reliance on mirrors can hinder the social experience in VR for others. This research deepens our understanding of user behavior in social VR and provides insights that could guide future design improvements to enrich the overall user experience.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to develop predictive models of sensory integration disorder (SID) in children, alongside identifying key factors of SID using machine learning algorithms that by establishing could help in formulating early health interventions. We conducted a stratified random sampling method to assess 1,032 3–6-year-old children (541 boys and 491 girls) using the Child Sensory Integration Scale in Fujian Province, China. Demographics, personal and family living conditions, and social environment were potential risk factors. Univariate analysis was performed to select key predictive variables. We implemented four different machine learning algorithms: eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) algorithms to build predictive models that were subsequently evaluated for performance across both training and testing data sets. The areas under the ROC curve (AUC) in the training set of 0.828, 0.758, 0.759, and 0.801 for XGBoost, LR, SVM and RF, respectively, along with an accuracy of 0.755, 0.667, 0.685, and 0.696 were achieved in the training set respectively. The AUCs in the test set was 0.725, 0.703, 0.707, and 0.690, with accuracies of 0.696, 0.686, 0.686, and 0.623, respectively. In conclusion, XGBoost was the most accurate, stable and outperformed each of the other algorithms. Sleep quality, age, screen time, emotional warmth, sleep duration were the top five factors identified by the XGBoost model. The results indicate the importance of the XGBoost model for the early detection of children with the risk of SID, which is a valid foundation for the early intervention work.},

abstract = {Suicide is a small number of individuals who suffer from long-term and complex psychological depression and take extreme measures to end their personal lives voluntarily. The rapid development of social media platforms has prompted a large number of users to share their mental health status online. Although some progress has been made in the evaluation of suicide detection algorithms in the comments of social media users, it is necessary to combine the development history of users' mental health status to predict the changes in users' suicidal psychology accurately. Current detection algorithms mainly use attention mechanisms to evaluate the probability of word-level suicidal tendencies in user comments. However, word-level attention mechanisms may not be able to find related suicidal tendencies posts and lack the historical process of capturing psychological information transformation in user comments. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel temporal sensing module, that adaptively adjusts the temporal interval nodes of user historical comment information by analyzing the temporal logic of user information, and comprehensively detects the suicidal tendency of user comments. In implementing the algorithm, the user comment post is decomposed into multiple independent hidden states through the time series awareness module, and the most important time series scale is adaptively selected by combining the time series context information of the post. Finally, the experimental comparison in the public dataset Reddit proves that the accuracy of the proposed algorithm in detecting the psychological suicide tendency of users is better than the current baseline model.},

By the end of 2023, the operating mileage has reached 159,000 km, including 45,000 km of high-speed railway. With the continuous expansion of high-speed railway development scale, the country also attaches more and more importance to railway operation safety. The report of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China pointed out that we should accelerate the construction of a modern infrastructure system, transportation equipment system, transportation service system, and transportation governance system, promote the safe, intelligent, green and open development of transportation, and find a new road of transportation modernization with Chinese characteristics. Many scholars have successively proposed high-speed railway perimeter monitoring technology schemes based on various sensor devices. However, due to the diversity of monitoring equipment, uneven data interfaces and unified data standards, centralized testing of high-speed railway perimeter intrusion monitoring technology based on different types and models of sensing equipment has been unable to be carried out, and synchronous testing cannot be conducted in a unified test environment. In order to solve the above problems, this paper carried out research on device interface, data standardization, sample library construction methods and test methods, and compared various high-speed railway perimeter intrusion monitoring technology schemes based on multi-sensor fusion to verify the functional performance and environmental adaptability of various monitoring devices in actual operation scenarios.},

abstract = {Today's world political and economic landscape is complex and volatile, the international environment is turbulent, geopolitical events are frequent, and the high-quality development of China's foreign trade faces greater uncertainty. Based on quarterly data from 2003-2022, this paper investigates whether China's export resilience is affected by geopolitical risk in trading partner countries. The findings show that: (1) geopolitical risk of trading partner countries do have a negative impact on China's export resilience, and this effect is transmitted through supply chain; (2) China's export resilience is more sensitive to geopolitical risk in developing countries than in developed countries; (3) China's export resilience is more significantly hampered by geopolitical risk in the wake of epidemics.},

abstract = {The range of applications for aerial vehicles is expanding rapidly, encompassing various fields such as transportation, security, rescue, and mapping. The foundation for the execution of these tasks is accurate localization. The prevailing localization method for aerial vehicles is currently reliant on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). However, this method is vulnerable to disruptions caused by occlusion or interference, particularly in environments such as mountainous regions, forests, and urban canyons. Inertial navigation systems and visual odometers are commonly employed in GNSS-denied environments; however, their long-term accuracy is poor due to error accumulation. Absolute visual localization, based on image matching, exhibits superior long-term accuracy and does not require external devices, making it a suitable alternative when GNSS is unavailable. Additionally, deep learning has demonstrated remarkable potential in image matching, offering higher accuracy compared to traditional methods. The proposed methodology utilizes a deep learning-based image matching technique, employing the LoFTR model to match features on rectified aerial images and segmented satellite maps. Addressing the sensitivity of the conventional regional perspective transformation to nonlinear image differences, a central perspective transformation is proposed to calculate the precise position of the aerial vehicle on the map. The experimental results, obtained from flights at an altitude of 500 m, demonstrate that the proposed method, with a spatial resolution of 1.1 m for the aerial images and 2.4 m for the map blocks, exhibits a mean absolute error of 17.39 m. This outcome signifies a 54.55\% reduction in error when contrasted with the conventional approach on the same dataset, attaining a level of accuracy comparable to that of general GNSS localization. Furthermore, the proposed method exhibits robustness to seasonal alterations in ground scene, providing an accurate and reliable solution for aerial vehicle localization in GNSS-denied environments.},

Although IA interventions exist, there is limited research on embedding this skill into daily life through ecological momentary interventions (EMIs). Multidisciplinary research has focused on how and when to deliver EMIs based on users’ contexts, but often oversimplifies or relies on proxies to represent their circumstances and environments. Here, we explore context through a user-centered lens, investigating how and when 21 young women are willing to practice IA. During a 2-week experience sampling study, they shared their activities and openness to IA throughout each day. Later, they sketched EMIs to scaffold their activities with IA and shared further qualitative insights across several one-on-one interviews. Our findings identify activities and internal and external qualities conducive to IA and offer broader implications for designing digital EMIs tailored to users’ contexts.},

abstract = {This paper explores the integration of co-design and art-making in developing technologies that support personhood in dementia care. While technologies for dementia care have advanced, there remains a gap in creating solutions that are directly informed by the experiences of people living with dementia and support their individuality. In collaboration with the specialist arts organisation Bright Shadow CIO, our work involves engaging people living with dementia in the design process. Over five weeks of co-design sessions, 44 participants worked alongside artists to craft four physical boxes that represent “meaningful places.” The physical boxes were then transformed into VR environments, allowing participants to immerse themselves in and interact with their creations from a first-person perspective. Our findings demonstrate that VR alone is insufficient in dementia care. For VR to be meaningful, it must be be part of a broader intervention that includes trust-building, sensory engagement, and creative involvement. Within this process, art-making serves as both a method and medium, providing a means of self-expression and connection to identity. Our findings challenge conventional approaches to dementia-focused VR, advocating for a shift toward inclusive and care-driven technology design.},

To unpack factors that are important in developing a sense of home and belonging in refugee communities, we lean on the theoretical concept of ’place-belongingness’ - we did this by conducting 6 co-design workshops involving 15 refugee participants, via the ’Magic Machine’ workshop approach. From the workshops, we uncovered how cultural identity and memory, life stability and normalcy, security and privacy, resilience and ingenuity, and social connections are central to their sense of home. This research contributes to HCI by building on the theoretical concept of place-belongingness in the context of forced displacement, proposing design implications that address refugees’ needs for home from cultural and social dimensions, and design considerations for refugees’ domestic settings.},

Previous reviews primarily focused on its performance and effectiveness in health contexts. In contrast, this review takes a human-centric approach and reviews studies on users’ attitudes and experiences. We conducted a narrative review to identify (1) the facilitators and barriers of wearable stress management technology (WSMT) and (2) design considerations for human-centered WSMT. We identified 28 articles reporting user perspectives on stress management technology, primarily based on evaluation studies in which user perspectives were gathered through qualitative methods. We found five facilitators and barriers of WSMT (i.e., usefulness, functionality/interactivity, seamlessness, user privacy, and technology's image). Additionally, we synthesized 18 design considerations, highlighted two main design challenges, and proposed a value-sensitive approach for future research. This review adds to the HCI literature by demonstrating the complexity of designing human-centered WSMT and the need for actionable recommendations.},

abstract = {Walking on inclined surfaces is common in some Virtual Reality (VR) scenarios, for instance, when moving between floors of a building, climbing a tower, or ascending a virtual mountain. Existing approaches enabling realistic walking experiences in such settings typically require the user to use bulky walking-in-place hardware or to walk in a physical area. Addressing this challenge, we present RedirectedStepper, a locomotion technique leveraging a novel device based on a mini exercise stepper to provide realistic VR staircase walking experiences by alternating the tilt of the two stepper pedals. RedirectedStepper employs a new exponential mapping function to visually morph the user’s real foot motion to a corresponding curved path in the virtual environment (VE). Combining this stepper and the visual mapping function provides an in-place locomotion technique allowing users to virtually ascend an infinite staircase or slope while walking-in-place (WIP). We conducted three within-subject user studies (n=36) comparing RedirectedStepper with a WIP locomotion technique using the Kinect. Our studies indicate that RedirectedStepper improves the users’ sense of realism in walking on staircases in VR. Based on a set of design implications derived from the user studies, we developed SnowRun, a VR exergame application, demonstrating the use of the RedirectedStepper concept.},

Drawing inspiration from the established benefits of group therapy, particularly the sense of belonging it fosters, we developed a multi-chatbot group motivational interviewing system. The system consists of a facilitator bot and two peer bots, and simulates a group counseling environment for PMS management using Large Language Models (LLMs). We conducted a study with 63 participants and divided them into three conditions (no intervention, 1-on-1 chatbot, group chatbots) over two menstruation cycles for evaluation. Our findings revealed that participants in the group chat condition exhibited higher levels of engagement and language convergence with the chatbots. These participants were also able to engage in social learning and demonstrated motivation in coping through interactions with the chatbots. Finally, we discuss design implications for multi-chatbot interactions in supporting mental health.},

We introduce MagPie, a novel BoD interface that leverages the magnetic phenomenon induced by MagSafe, part of the wireless charging standard. Users can seamlessly attach MagPie to MagSafe-enabled smartphones and interact using tangible, modular interfaces that generate unique magnetic signals upon activation. MagPie then detects these signals and recognizes the input through magnetic sensing. Our experiments with real-world users demonstrate that i) MagPie achieves high performance in accuracy, usability, deployability, responsiveness, and robustness across diverse environments, and ii) its tangible, intuitive, and customizable design opens up possibilities for a whole new class of smartphone interaction scenarios.},

abstract = {In Affective computing, recognizing users’ emotions accurately is the basis of affective human–computer interaction. Understanding users’ interoception contributes to a better understanding of individually different emotional abilities, which is essential for achieving inter-individually accurate emotion estimation. However, existing interoception measurement methods, such as the heart rate discrimination task, have several limitations, including their dependence on a well-controlled laboratory environment and precision apparatus, making monitoring users’ interoception challenging. This study aims to determine other forms of data that can explain users’ interoceptive or similar states in their real-world lives and propose a novel hypothetical concept “cyberoception,” a new sense (1) which has properties similar to interoception in terms of the correlation with other emotion-related abilities, and (2) which can be measured only by the sensors embedded inside commodity smartphone devices in users’ daily lives. Results from a 10-day-long in-lab/in-the-wild hybrid experiment reveal a specific cyberoception type “Turn On” (users’ subjective sensory perception about the frequency of turning-on behavior on their smartphones) significantly related to participants’ emotional valence. We anticipate that cyberoception to serve as a fundamental building block for developing more “emotion-aware”, user-friendly applications and services.},

Our technique is established on the integration of multi-resonant circuits in smart textile interfaces, and utilizing near-field electromagnetic coupling between two coils to facilitate wireless power transfer and data acquisition from smart textile interface. A key aspect of our system is the development of a mathematical model that accurately represents the equivalent circuit of the sensing system. Using this model, we developed a novel algorithm to accurately estimate sensor signals based on changes in system impedance. Through simulation-based experiments and a user study, we demonstrate that our technique effectively supports multiple textile sensors of various types.},

Public health organizations are increasingly turning to Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve access to timely and personalized information. However, recent HCI scholarship indicates that significant challenges remain in incorporating context awareness and mitigating bias in LLMs. In this paper, we study the development of a culturally-appropriate LLM-based chatbot for reproductive health with underserved women in urban India. Through user interactions, focus groups, and interviews with multiple stakeholders, we examine the chatbot’s response to sensitive and highly contextual queries on reproductive health. Our findings reveal strengths and limitations of the system in capturing local context, and complexities around what constitutes “culture”. Finally, we discuss how local context might be better integrated, and present a framework to inform the design of culturally-sensitive chatbots for community health.},

To assist in designing and utilizing the system more effectively, we developed a structure library inspired by dynamic plant forms, conducted extensive technical evaluations, created an educational platform accessible to users, and provided a design tool for deformation adjustments and behavior previews. Finally, several ecological applications demonstrate the potential of TH-Wood to significantly enhance human interaction with natural environments and expand the boundaries of human-nature relationships.},

abstract = {Urban environments can inhibit the formation of publics due to their distracting nature and distant social ties. Yet, forming publics is critical for bringing and mobilizing citizens around issues. In this paper, we introduce a methodology that combines oral history collection and qualitative analysis to foster connections among youth in a North American public school. During our project, the youth interviewed classmates, guardians, and strangers from their community about the meaning of home, then collectively analyzed the oral histories using qualitative analysis techniques. Our findings highlight that this process generated unexpected connections around shared experiences despite the different backgrounds of project participants, thus fostering a sense of attachment to home as a cause for public formation. Our paper demonstrates the effectiveness of such approach in building attachments as a pre-cursor to public formation in community-centered work, while reflecting on the associated practical challenges like skill development, sustained engagement, and emotional labor.},

abstract = {With psychiatry lagging behind other medical fields in terms of innovation in instruments and methods, AI provides it an opportunity to catch up. Advocates of digital phenotyping promise to provide an objective tool that detects symptoms by analysing data from personal devices. We argue that digital phenotyping requires a more reflexive and critical approach to its design and an alignment of the clinicians’ interests in generating relevant evidence with the needs of service users who seek tools to manage their condition. We propose a felt informatics approach, situating digital phenotyping design within the problem space of pragmatist aesthetics. Within this perspective, felt life becomes a central object and a site for digital phenotyping design. This paper reveals the ways diagnostic data mediates mental ill health experience, emphasises the cultivation of aesthetic sensibility as a fundamental element of digital phenotyping and includes design considerations for practitioners and researchers.},

abstract = {This paper examines the potential of commercial earbuds for detecting physiological biomarkers like heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) for stress assessment. Using accelerometer (IMU) and photoplethysmography (PPG) data from earbuds, we compared these estimates with reference electrocardiogram (ECG) data from 81 healthy participants. We explored using low-power accelerometer sensors for capturing ballistocardiography (BCG) signals. However, BCG signal quality can vary due to individual differences and body motion. Therefore, BCG data quality assessment is critical before extracting any meaningful biomarkers. To address this, we introduced the ECG-gated BCG heatmap, a new method for assessing BCG signal quality. We trained a Random Forest model to identify usable signals, achieving 82\% test accuracy. Filtering out unusable signals improved HR/HRV estimation accuracy to levels comparable to PPG-based estimates. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of accurate physiological monitoring with earbuds, advancing the development of user-friendly wearable health technologies for stress management.},

abstract = {We present a qualitative study with five healthcare experts specialised in different types of touch practice to gain insight in how caring touch can be enacted. Through our analysis we focus on how to transfer this learning into design considerations towards enacting caring touch from technologies. Despite the rapidly growing expectation for and design interest in touch from technologies intending to enhance care and well-being, the knowledge on how to design caring touch is still fragmented. How caring touch is enacted in inter-personal touch is under-explored and such expertise from healthcare practitioners has not been engaged from the perspective of HCI design research. We propose designers to consider caring as an experiential quality instead of a division between instrumental types of touch and caring types. We recommend when designing for a caring quality in technology-initiated touch that designers create a progression of touch with dynamic sensitivity and adapt the materiality of actuating devices to the plural dimensions of the body’s textures.},
