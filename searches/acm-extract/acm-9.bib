abstract = {Design reflects the human tendency to adapt to and inhabit surroundings, with architectural decisions significantly shaping behavioral and cognitive experiences. This pictorial focuses on the floor as a primary, embodied interface in space. To explore its influence, five floor design typologies (completing, switching, zoning, stimulating, and bending) were identified through twenty hours of expert discussions involving architects, designers, an artist, an engineer, and researchers. A collaborative workshop further defined sub-categories via participatory observations. Fieldwork then informed site selection for an observational study, which confirmed the behavioral and cognitive impacts of the identified typologies. Based on these findings, floor codes were developed by shifting the design focus from visual cues to somatic sensations and applied in design scenarios. This research contributes to understanding human experience in architectural environments. It offers insights for virtual architecture, proposing evidence-based strategies for designing personalized and interactive spaces in virtual and mixed-reality contexts.},

abstract = {This study was an attempt to analyse decision-making frameworks in mountain tourism with the application of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), remote sensing data analysis, and environmental impact assessment analysis, and to project a data-driven decision-making method applicable to identify key factors influencing sustainable tourism management. Using an integrated data collection approach with remote sensing and tourism-specific knowledge in this study, an integrated decision-support framework was computed and classified into hierarchical levels of decision-making priorities. During the process, a set of environmental and tourism-related factors were selected (here, environmental settings, visitor preferences, and safety standards) together with the degree of impact in sustainability of mountain tourism. Integrated SEM analysis and geospatial modeling were applied to generate the necessary factors (geospatial and environmental) maps for real-time decision-making approach. The SEM model, along with geospatial overlay analysis method, was used to determine the significance of the factors, and on the other hand, remote sensing technology was applied for calculating environmental risks and resource availability. The entire process was executed in the integrated GIS and SEM-based software tool that supports real-time analysis and visualization. The analysis showed that the overall sustainability performance of the area was at moderate level and was partly determined by availability of facilities and environmental conditions. Areas under high visitor pressure of environmentally sensitive regions indicated that the sustainability status showed critical vulnerabilities in these parts of the mountainous regions. The study also revealed that visitor preferences and environmental factors have serious influence on the decision-making priorities of the tourism management teams. Considering geospatial and socio-environmental characteristics of mountainous regions, the study area was further divided into four priority zones which may serve as base guidelines of planning and intervention strategies for the sustainable development of mountain tourism.},

The aim of the study is to develop an integrated approach, taking into account various natural factors such as tectonic shifts, stability of quarry sides and groundwater conditions, in order to predict possible dangerous situations. The proposed mathematical model is based on a system of differential equations describing the dynamics of significant changes in the state of rocks, groundwater flow control and temperature changes. To build the calculation algorithm, machine discharge methods are used to calibrate data based on previous data and current indicators of sensors installed in underground mines. The integration of the information system with the IoT platform allows real-time monitoring of environmental parameters, increasing the accuracy of forecasting coefficients. The results of testing the algorithmic model on real data obtained from above-ground mines showed high accuracy in predicting dangerous situations, such as collapse of quarry sides and fluctuations in the groundwater level, with an accuracy of 85\%.},

abstract = {Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are used to safeguard on-device models. However, directly employing TEEs to secure the entire DNN model is challenging due to the limited computational speed. Utilizing GPU can accelerate DNN’s computation speed but widely available commercial GPUs usually lack security protection. To this end, scholars introduce TEE-Shielded DNN Partition (TSDP), a method that protects privacy-sensitive weights within TEEs and offloads insensitive weights to GPUs. Nevertheless, current methods do not consider the presence of a knowledgeable adversary who can access abundant publicly available pre-trained models and datasets. This article investigates the security of the existing methods against such a knowledgeable adversary and reveals their inability to fulfill their security promises. Consequently, we introduce a novel partition before training strategy, which effectively separates privacy-sensitive weights from other components of the model. Our evaluation demonstrates that our approach can offer full model protection with a computational cost reduced by a factor of 10. In addition to traditional CNN models, we also demonstrate the scalability to large language models. Our approach can compress the private functionalities of the large language model to lightweight slices and achieve the same level of protection as the shielding-whole-model baseline.},

The ecological security of the northern foothills of the Qinling Mountains is influenced by the dynamic interplay of multiple uncertain factors. To address the issue of incomplete information in decision-making, this study proposes the application of a topologically sequential three-branch decision-making method, which facilitates topologically transformable and sequential decision-making. The evaluation index system for ecological security in the Qinling region is first developed based on the DPSIR (Driving Force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response) model. An empirical analysis of the ecological security levels of the northern Qinling Mountains is then conducted using socio-economic statistics and remote sensing data from Xi'an, Baoji, and Weinan cities, covering the period from 2010 to 2020. This analysis applies the topologically sequential three-branch decision-making method and compares its results with those derived from the entropy-weighted physical element topological decision-making method. The findings demonstrate that the proposed method is effective, achieving an accuracy rate of 81.82\%. Furthermore, this approach accounts for the dynamic fluctuations of influencing factors, providing a more accurate reflection of the actual conditions surrounding the ecological security of the northern Qinling Mountains.},

abstract = {The advent of MiniApps, operating within larger SuperApps, has revolutionized user experiences by offering a wide range of services without the need for individual app downloads. However, this convenience has raised significant privacy concerns, as these MiniApps often require access to sensitive data, potentially leading to privacy violations. Despite existing privacy regulations and platform guidelines, there is a lack of effective mechanisms to safeguard user privacy fully. To address this critical gap, we introduce MiniScope, a novel two-phase hybrid analysis approach, specifically designed for the MiniApp environment. This approach overcomes the limitations of existing static analysis techniques by incorporating UI transition states analysis, cross-package callback control flow resolution, and automated iterative UI exploration. This allows for a comprehensive understanding of MiniApps’ privacy practices, addressing the unique challenges of sub-package loading and event-driven callbacks. Our empirical evaluation of over 120K MiniApps using MiniScope demonstrates its effectiveness in identifying privacy inconsistencies. The results reveal significant issues, with 5.7\% of MiniApps over-collecting private data and 33.4\% overclaiming data collection. We have responsibly disclosed our findings to 2,282 developers, receiving 44 acknowledgments. These findings emphasize the urgent need for more precise privacy monitoring systems and highlight the responsibility of SuperApp operators to enforce stricter privacy measures.},

abstract = {In recent years, the problem of icing on power transmission lines caused by extreme weather has become increasingly serious. Traditional manual inspections are inefficient, costly, and pose safety risks. An intelligent, high-precision integrated inspection and deicing solution is urgently needed. To address this problem, this study proposes an intelligent inspection and deicing system for power transmission lines based on an unmanned aerial vehicle platform. First, a multimodal sensor fusion unmanned aerial vehicle inspection platform is designed, integrating a high-resolution visible light camera, an infrared thermal imager, and a lidar. Secondly, an icing target detection model is constructed based on the improved YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once version 5) algorithm, and a transfer learning strategy is introduced to optimize the pre-training weights to improve the recognition accuracy of icing thickness and position. Finally, a modular deicing device is designed, using a lightweight robotic arm equipped with a high-frequency ultrasonic and microwave composite deicing unit to achieve efficient deicing and energy consumption control. The experimental results show that the system based on the YOLOv5 algorithm can stably identify ice layers in complex environments, especially in ice layers of different thicknesses (1mm to 15mm), with a detection accuracy of 92.3\%, which is better than the accuracy of YOLOv4 and Faster R-CNN. In terms of deicing efficiency, the microwave composite deicing technology has low energy consumption while ensuring efficient deicing, and has a good cost-effectiveness. The maximum deicing efficiency reaches 7.5 kg/min and the energy consumption is 42.5 Wh. Comprehensive evaluation shows that the operating efficiency and stability of the proposed system in extreme weather conditions have been significantly improved, providing an efficient and reliable solution for intelligent inspection and deicing of transmission lines.},

abstract = {Signal injection attacks pose a serious threat to systems that rely on sensor information to determine their behavior. Using such an attack, an attacker can remotely manipulate the values of a sensor by transmitting appropriately formed RF signals that induce a current in the sensor wires. For example, to manipulate the temperature sensor in a battery management system, to trigger thermal protection, and shut down the battery. While several defense mechanisms have been proposed, they all need additional hardware to work. In this paper, we present RIPPLE, a fully software-based detection mechanism that can reliably detect signal injection attacks against drone sensor systems. A software-only solution is a practical way to add protection to an existing fleet of drones, and it is a cost effective alternative to the existing proposals for new drones. Our detection mechanism exploits a physical layer property known as small-scale (fast) fading, which causes the wireless channel between the attacker and drone to change unpredictably. As a result, the power induced by the attacker's transmission will oscillate rapidly, whenever the drone is in motion. We show for the first time that this effect occurs even with extremely minimal motion, such as a drone hovering in place on a calm, windless day. This oscillation is used as the basis of our detection system. We conduct an in-depth evaluation of RIPPLE on drones in several different environments. Our results show that RIPPLE reliably detects signal injection attacks. Even for weak attacks, changing the temperature by as little as 2°C, and with a drone movement of only a few millimeters, we have a success rate of over 98\%. The performance only improves with stronger attack signals or more movement.},

The MSPLCK achieves large sensory fields and multi-scale feature extraction through parallel dilated convolution, whereas the EPAM can simultaneously process global shared information and local time-frequency features effectively coping with uneven noise distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MixSENet shows significant performance advantages on the Voice Bank + DEMAND dataset, with a parameter count of only 0.43M, significantly reducing training and deployment costs. The method has substantial practical value in real application scenarios, especially for resource-constrained mobile devices and embedded systems.},

However, conventional image and audio watermarking techniques are inadequate for radar copyright protection due to radar signals' sparsity, vulnerability and complexity. In this paper, we present RFinger, an ownership verification framework for static indoor millimeter-wave radar datasets. Our approach encodes environmental information extracted from radar signals into digital watermarks, strategically embedding these within carefully selected data frames to establish robust verification credentials. We develop statistical hypothesis testing metrics to detect unauthorized access to RFinger-protected data in black-box setting. Our strategic watermark design ensures that the unauthorized models exhibit distinctly anomalous performance on verification data compared to legitimate models. Through experiments on two large millimeter-wave radar datasets, we have validated that our designed strategy provides high watermark retrieval accuracy without compromising downstream tasks.},

One technical solution is to employ an Anti-Tamper Radio (ATR) approach, analyzing the radio wave propagation effects within a protected device to detect unauthorized physical alterations. However, ATR systems face key challenges in terms of susceptibility to signal manipulation attacks, limited reliability due to environmental noise, and regulatory constraints from wide bandwidth usage.In this work, we propose and experimentally evaluate an ATR system complemented by a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) to dynamically reconfigure the wireless propagation environment. We show that this approach can enhance resistance against signal manipulation attacks, reduce bandwidth requirements from several GHz down to as low as 20 MHz, and improve robustness to environmental disturbances such as internal fan movements.Our work demonstrates that RIS integration can strengthen the ATR performance to enhance security, sensitivity, and robustness, recognizing the potential of smart radio environments for ATR-based tamper detection.},

abstract = {Lifelogging is the passive collection, storage and analysis of daily data through wearable sensors. Question Answering (QA) for lifelog data enables natural language interactions with personal daily life records, providing insights into individual routines and behaviours. While this task has great potential for personal analytics and memory augmentation, progress has been limited due to the challenges of lifelog management, since they can comprise of enormous multi-modal data sets spanning a lifetime. We introduce a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach for addressing the lifelog QA task. A RAG approach first includes a retrieval model finding the correct lifelog events containing answers and then a large language model (LLM) generating answers from the questions. In addition, we construct an open-ended lifelog QA benchmark with 14,187 QA pairs to examine the RAG approach to lifelog QA. Using an embedding-based retrieval approach, our lifelog context retriever achieves a performance of 77.67\% Recall@5 and 94.35\% Recall@20 using an embedding-based retrieval approach with the Stella 1.5B model. Combined with the Mistral 7B model, the model achieves scores of 39.54\% ROUGE-L and 3.475 Accuracy on a scale of 5 scored by GPT-4o. This approach potentially provides an effective approach to lifelog QA with high performance that does not require fine-tuning.},

abstract = {In modern industrial environments, anomaly detection is a critical technology for ensuring production quality and safety. However, existing methods face the challenge of information redundancy when handling high-dimensional data, and traditional autoencoders struggle to effectively capture subtle anomaly features. To address these limitations, we propose UMLLA-AD, an efficient network for detecting and localizing anomalies. UMLLA-AD attains performance enhancement via two core innovations. Firstly, we have designed an Adaptive Feature Channel Selection (AFCS) mechanism that significantly reduces noise and information redundancy by dynamically screening feature channels containing critical anomaly information. Secondly, we have developed the UNet-based Mamba-like linear attention mechanism (UMLLA) reconstruction network, which combines the global modeling capability of the Mamba architecture with a multi-head linear attention mechanism. This integration enhances the sensitivity to subtle anomaly features and improves reconstruction accuracy within the UNet framework. We conducted extensive experiments on several industrial datasets, including MVTec-AD, BTAD, MPDD, and VisA. The UMLLA-AD framework showed significant competitive advantages in all datasets tested. Particularly on the MVTec-AD dataset, our approach achieved an Image AUROC of 99.7\% and a Pixel AUROC of 99.1\%. These results clearly demonstrate that this research provides an efficient and robust solution for industrial anomaly detection.},

This study presents a TinyML-based stress classification model optimized for edge devices and wearable sensors, enabling continuous, low-power monitoring without reliance on cloud computing. The WESAD (Wearable Stress and Affect Detection) dataset was used to develop and evaluate the model, leveraging photoplethysmography (PPG) signals to classify stress levels. Multiple statistical time-domain features were extracted to capture relevant physiological patterns. Various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, including DNN, CNN, were assessed for their effectiveness in stress classification. Among these, an optimized DNN model demonstrated superior performance, achieving 98\% accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. This makes it highly suitable for edge deployment, ensuring real-time stress detection with minimal resource consumption. The results validate the feasibility of TinyML-based stress classification on wearable devices, offering a cost-effective, real-time, and energy-efficient solution for continuous stress monitoring.

abstract = {Autonomous navigation and space-mapping methodologies in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) typically depend on advanced, resource-intensive technologies such as LiDAR, GPS, and inertial measurement units (IMUs). These systems provide high-precision navigation and mapping capabilities but at the cost of increasing UAV platforms’ complexity, power consumption, and unit cost. As a result, deploying UAVs in swarms, essential for large-scale applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and agricultural surveillance, becomes economically non-viable. To address this challenge, we present VisNAV, a vision-assisted navigation and mapping framework designed to provide efficient and cost-effective solutions for UAV-based agricultural field exploration without auxiliary sensor support. VisNAV aims to optimize the overall performance of the UAV’s navigation while reducing the reliance on expensive hardware, making it more suitable for broader, scalable applications. Our proposed model is based on focal length optimization and is tailored for agricultural applications, providing visual accuracy of 12-14 cm. It is designed to perform effectively across various agricultural terrains.},

Therefore, this study proposes to develop an innovative approach by comparing machine learning models applied to data obtained from a smart belt equipped with advanced sensors. The adopted methodology encompasses data collection, preprocessing, and analysis, evaluating several models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and k-NN. The results reveal that Logistic Regression is the most effective model, demonstrating the best performance metrics in accuracy, AUC, recall, and MCC, with an AUC of 0.763. This model surpasses others in identifying disc herniations and offers balanced and consistent performance. Thus, the utility of machine learning models in clinical practice is validated, proposing a promising tool to improve the diagnosis and treatment of disc herniations.

abstract = {Abstract: The development of flexible and wearable pressure sensors has gained significant attention due to their potential applications in health monitoring, robotics, and human-machine interfaces. However, existing pressure sensors face challenges such as limited sensitivity, narrow detection ranges, and difficulties in scalable fabrication. In this study, we propose a novel multi-layer f-MXene/MXene/PU sponge-based flexible pressure sensor, designed to address these limitations. The sensor was fabricated using a dip-coating method, where functionalized MXene (f-MXene) and MXene nanosheets were sequentially deposited onto a polyurethane (PU) sponge substrate. This structure enhances the sensor's mechanical flexibility, electrical conductivity, and air permeability while preserving its compressibility. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized multilayer f-MXene/MXene/PU sensor exhibits a high-sensitivity of 7.4 kPa-1 over a broad pressure-sensing range of 58 kPa. Additionally, the sensor features rapid response and recovery times (340 ms and 300 ms, respectively) and maintains stable performance over 200 consecutive loading–unloading cycles, indicating strong durability. Application tests further validate its capability to detect a wide range of pressures, from subtle touch interactions (e.g., finger pressing) to high-force applications (e.g., foot stepping). These findings highlight the potential of MXene-based composite sensors in wearable electronics and real-time pressure monitoring. Future research should focus on enhancing the long-term stability of MXene against oxidation and integrating wireless communication modules for smart sensor applications.},

abstract = {Due to the non Gaussian dynamic coupling characteristics of sports basketball trajectories, traditional result based statistical data is difficult to reflect the constraints and blocking relationships of different basketball teaching tasks during the execution process. Unable to make matching teaching adjustments based on these sports data, resulting in ineffective improvement of basketball shooting accuracy in student sports training. In this regard, the application method of IoT technology in the visual design of sports basketball courses has been proposed. The study utilized the perception layer of the Internet of Things to obtain motion measurement data from different students, and integrated multi-sensor data from video surveillance and wearable devices to reduce basketball visual trajectory data errors through D-S evidence decision rules based on multi-source fusion technology. Considering the non Gaussian dynamic coupling characteristics of basketball trajectory data, constraints and blocking relationships for different visual teaching tasks were generated using comprehensive feature parameters. By quantifying the impact of different teaching tasks on basketball trajectory based on priority, we can optimize and match basketball teaching tasks to improve basketball shooting accuracy. Generate visual effects of students' comprehensive sports data to achieve visual design of sports basketball courses. The experimental results show that after applying the designed sports basketball course visualization method, students' shooting accuracy within the three-point line is significantly improved, effectively improving their shooting accuracy.},

In order to find a simple but effective 3D reconstruction scheme for indoor environment, this paper investigates the method of indoor 3D reconstruction based on SLAM framework and RGB-D camera. Compared with the basic SLAM scheme, this paper combines the methods of ORB-SLAM3 framework, GCN feature extractor, dense point cloud modeling and grid modeling, to obtain better performance of indoor 3D scene reconstruction.

abstract = {Recent gains in popularity of AI conversational agents have led to their increased use for improving productivity and supporting well-being. While previous research has aimed to understand the risks associated with interactions with AI conversational agents, these studies often fall short in capturing the lived experiences of individuals. Additionally, psychological risks have often been presented as a sub-category within broader AI-related risks in past taxonomy works, leading to under-representation of the impact of psychological risks of AI use. To address these challenges, our work presents a novel risk taxonomy focusing on psychological risks of using AI gathered through the lived experiences of individuals. We employed a mixed-method approach, involving a comprehensive survey with 283 people with lived mental health experience and workshops involving experts with lived experience to develop a psychological risk taxonomy. Our taxonomy features 19 AI behaviors, 21 negative psychological impacts, and 15 contexts related to individuals. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-path vignette-based framework for understanding the complex interplay between AI behaviors, psychological impacts, and individual user contexts. Finally, based on the feedback obtained from the workshop sessions, we present design recommendations for developing safer and more robust AI agents. Our work offers an in-depth understanding of the psychological risks associated with AI conversational agents and provides actionable recommendations for policymakers, researchers, and developers.Content Warning: This paper includes discussions of sensitive topics, including but not limited to self-harm, body shaming, and discrimination.},

This research highlights the need for farming education to enhance children’s understanding of plants, environmental responsibility, and food choices. Traditional methods often struggle with engagement, leading us to develop WooGu, an educational game that integrates digital devices, tangible user interfaces (TUIs), and embodied physical interactions. WooGu provides multi-modal cues and encourages physical engagement through a combination of augmented digital visual elements and 3D-printed tools with integrated sensors, supporting embodied farming operations. Evaluated with 15 children aged 5-12, WooGu enhanced their knowledge of farming, engagement, and attitudes toward agriculture. The study also found that WooGu enhanced children’s appreciation of farming and expressed a desire to innovate agricultural practices. These findings suggest that adopting embodied interactions and multi-modal feedback can improve children’s learning of agricultural concepts.},

This empirical study investigates how 17 expectants in Sweden use such apps to make sense of their pregnancies. It is grounded in feminist perspectives, highlighting the need to focus on women's health. Drawing on entanglement and flat ontology, we show how apps are part of socio-material configurations where they contribute to pregnancy meaning-making. We show how users experience a gradual realization that apps model ideal pregnancies and not the participants’ own, how the app's commercial nature conflicts with many participants' ideals of pregnancy, and how participants continue to use apps despite this but engage in selective use. All to support ways of making pregnancy in desired ways. Finally, we outline how users engage with pregnancy apps and the resulting natureculture arrangements where bodies and technology are intertwined and co-constructed. We argue that entanglement should be seen as a process, not a state, as users continually negotiate their use, engaging in what could be called processes of untangling.},

However, traditional health data visualizations often overlook emotional depth, contextual relevance, and lived experiences. In response, four HCI researchers conducted a 35-day field study, examining their well-being data as participants and co-designers to reimagine their relationship with self-tracking technologies and health data representations. Grounded in participatory, soma-inspired, and design fiction principles, this study encouraged participants to move beyond passive data consumption through creative experimentation, embedding personal experiences and collaborative exploration to challenge conventional representations and reimagine well-being through design. The findings demonstrate how collaborative sensemaking can reframe well-being interventions as creative processes that empower individuals’ lived experiences.

abstract = {Retail experiences in the Metaverse are becoming increasingly popular, driven by a business model that relies on brand engagement and user-generated virtual worlds (UGVWs). While much attention has been given to ideal design patterns for enhancing user engagement, there is a need for a critical examination of pain points that negatively impact their virtual product experiences. This study introduces anti-experiences as a methodological contribution, using speculative design to deliberately explore undesirable design elements and highlight engagement barriers in these virtual product experiences. Through group co-design and storyboarding, we conducted workshops with 30 participants using the Roblox platform as a case study, including XR designers, physical-world designers, and non-users of the Metaverse. Through this process, participants identified three key pain points: (1) missing diegetic elements, (2) fragmented social interactions, and (3) navigational ambiguity. By developing anti-design storyboards, participants critically examined how these pain points affect user engagement and satisfaction, uncovering potential risks and limitations of current Metaverse retail experiences. From these findings, we propose three key design insights to enhance virtual shopping environments: (1) Introducing play and balancing risk, (2) Shopping together between realities, (3) Orchestrating sensory richness and subtlety.},

In this pictorial, we explore how we might augment scholarly sensemaking by making the full range of scholarly information more senseable. First, we systematically reviewed systems for scholarly sensemaking, and enumerated key types of scholarly information and their properties. Then, we synthesized design patterns for materializing abstract information in modern artworks, and connected them with our enumerated scholarly information and properties to develop three novel conceptual designs for senseable scholarly sensemaking in immersive environments.

This machine-generated system creates atmospheric drawings with respect to the text of the poem, giving designers a series of idea visualisations. The drawings are utilized as a basis for the subsequent design of VR scenes, in which sensory experiences and avatars are employed to immerse the user in the poetic environment. The system takes full advantage of user interactivity and imagination, providing an active platform for exploring poetic moods.

abstract = {Simulation is crucial for developing autonomous driving systems, where AI algorithms process sensor data to perceive environments. However, training these algorithms require vast, diverse data, and existing methods face limitations. Manual scene construction in simulation platforms is slow and lacks scalability, while rendering-based approaches often produce inconsistent image sequences, failing to support high-quality algorithm training. Additionally, such methods cannot synthesize multi-modal data essential for perception models. To alleviate these problems, this paper proposes an automated system to generate multi-modal perception data (image, point cloud, vehicle status) by synthesizing diverse 3D scenes within a simulation platform. By directly constructing 3D scene models, the system eliminates perspective inconsistencies inherent in rendering-based methods. Experimental validation showing the system generates consistent, high-quality data for autonomous driving.},

abstract = {The occasional nature of I/O bursts in production clusters makes the substantial and expensive SSD internal hardware resources (e.g., computation and memory resources) always underutilized, resulting in cost inefficiency. Open-Channel SSD (OCSSD), as a pioneering solution, removes the SSD internal resources but rather leverages the host-side resources to serve I/O requests. Unfortunately, it faces adoption obstacles due to the heavy resource contention with user applications, hampered host-SSD collaboration, and proprietary firmware leakage risks. Tackling these challenges, we propose XHarvest, a new cost-efficient and high-performance SSD architecture, which harnesses compute express link (CXL) and trusted execution environment (TEE) to facilitate dynamic, efficient, and secure host resource harvesting. It reserves moderate SSD internal resources to isolate SSD internal tasks and applications under regular I/O loads while coping with occasional I/O bursts via dynamic host resource harvesting. To this end, XHarvest executes the firmware within the host-side TEE without disclosing sensitive algorithms while leveraging the cache-coherent and fine-grained CXL to build a unified and efficient metadata cache. XHarvest also capitalizes on the CXL and its security feature to enable secure and efficient host-SSD collaboration. The evaluation results show that XHarvest reduces the hardware cost by 31.50\% while achieving the same or even higher performance than conventional SSDs. It relieves resource contention via dynamic harvesting, reducing 2.27 \texttimes{} execution time over OCSSD in memory-intensive tasks.},

abstract = {The Web of Things (WoT) system standardizes the integration of ubiquitous IoT devices in physical environments, enabling various software applications to automatically sense and regulate the physical environment. While providing convenience, the complex interactions among software applications and physical environment make the WoT system vulnerable to violations caused by improper actuator operations, which may cause undesirable or even harmful results, posing serious risks to user safety and security. In response to this critical concern, many previous efforts have be made. However, existing works primarily focus on analyzing software application behaviors, with insufficient consideration of the physical interactions, multi-source violations, and environmental dynamics in such ubiquitous software systems. As a result, they fail to comprehensively detect the impact of actuator operations on the dynamic environment, thus limiting their effectiveness.    To address these limitations, we propose SysGuard, a violation detecting and handling approach. SysGuard employs the dynamic probabilistic graphical model (DPGM) to model the physical interactions as the physical interaction graph (PIG). In the offline phase, SysGuard takes device description models and history device logs as input to capture physical interactions by learning the PIG. In this process, a large language model (LLM) based causal analysis method is further introduced to filter out the device dependencies unrelated to physical interaction by analyzing the device interaction scenarios recorded in device logs. In the online phase, SysGuard processes user-customized violation rules, and monitors runtime device logs to predict violation states and generates handling policies by inferring the PIG. Evaluation on two real-world WoT systems shows that SysGuard significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art works, achieving high performance in both violation detection and handling. It also confirms the runtime efficiency and scalability of SysGuard. Ablation experiment on our constructed dataset demonstrates that the LLM-based causal analysis significantly improves the performance of SysGuard, with the accuracy increasing in both violation detecting and handling.},

abstract = {Excessive or insufficient exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light can have adverse effects on health, including the development of skin cancer, cataracts, and osteoporosis. An Earth observation (EO)-based UV index can estimate area-level UV indexes without effort in open-sky environments but can not provide sufficient accuracy for shaded environments. In contrast, conventional methods for monitoring individual-level, i.e., personal, UV exposure, such as mobile and wearable UV sensors, face limitations in terms of measurement and usability, presenting challenges for practical long-term usage. To address these issues, we introduce A-UVI, a method that enhances the accuracy of the EO-based UV index by leveraging raw signals from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). By integrating this EO-based UV index and an attenuation ratio estimated from raw GNSS signals, our method especially improves estimation accuracy in shady environments affected by obstructions. We evaluated our method on data collected by different GNSS receivers in different mobility scenarios encompassing a diverse range of contexts and observation areas over the course of three days. Our evaluation showed that A-UVI estimates the UV index with a precision exceeding existing methods by at least 44.25\%, achieving 5.53 times higher estimation accuracy in forest environments. We also confirmed that A-UVI is compatible with GNSS receivers in consumer-grade smartphones and has an average accuracy that is 23\% better than the baseline EO-based method. Our findings demonstrate that utilizing raw GNSS signals enables accurate estimation of the UV index in various conditions, including in shaded areas, without the need for particular measurement actions or devices. This marks a significant advancement in enabling passive individual-level UV exposure monitoring and adaptive UV exposure management beyond simple exposure tracking.},

To address this challenge, we propose a morphology-independent ABP estimation algorithm based on the Frank-Starling law. We also devise techniques to address calibration and PPG data drift issues commonly faced in continuous ABP monitoring. Further, a system called RingBP is developed towards continuous, comfortable, and generalized ABP monitoring using a smart ring. We design and implement a smart ring prototype and conduct extensive experiments involving 85 participants, demonstrating its superiority over other solutions.},

Substantial gains have been made since the days of hand-crafting heuristics as features, yet, progress has seemingly stalled on many popular benchmarks, with performance falling short of what may be considered 'sufficient'-despite the increase in computational power and scale of sensor data, as well as rising complexity in techniques being employed. The HAR community approaches a new paradigm shift, this time incorporating world knowledge from foundational models. In this paper, we take stock of sensor-based HAR - surveying it from its beginnings to the current state of the field, and charting its future. This is accompanied by a hands-on tutorial, through which we guide practitioners in developing HAR systems for real-world application scenarios. We provide a compendium for novices and experts alike, of methods that aim at finally solving the activity recognition problem.},

We explore the design space enabled by RadioGami, including sensing paper deformations like bending, tearing, and origami patterns (Miura, Kresling) at ranges up to 45.73 meters. RadioGami employs a novel ultra-low power (35μW) switching circuit with a tunnel diode for wireless functionality. These surfaces can sustainably operate by harvesting energy using tiny photodiodes. We demonstrate applications that monitor object status, track user interactions (rotation, sliding), and detect environmental changes.

abstract = {This paper introduces OpenMAE, a novel data enrichment framework utilizing open-world sensor data streams to facilitate efficient masked autoencoder (MAE) pretraining on vibration signals. Due to highly sparse event occurrences and inevitable distributional shifts from downstream tasks, directly concatenating large-scale open-domain data with limited in-domain data during pretraining leads to degraded downstream task performance. The problem is further complicated by missing knowledge of open-world sensor environments and associated physical event semantics. Against these challenges, OpenMAE makes the following contributions to vibration MAE pretraining with open-domain data: First, it automatically filters out uninformative samples based on the event activeness and information consistency without relying on human annotations; Second, to mind the gap between open-domain and in-domain distributions, OpenMAE develops a novel data mixing method, FreqCutMix, that combines two data types in the frequency domain as augmented pretraining samples, preserving both events-of-interest semantics from in-domain data and real-world diversity from open-domain data. The open-domain data scale in data mixing is dynamically increased as pretraining progresses to stabilize the model convergence. We download over 5 million open-world vibration samples from the Raspberry Shake datacenter1 and conduct extensive experiments with two applications (i.e., indoor activity and outdoor transportation analysis). The evaluation results show OpenMAE improves downstream task accuracies by up to 23\% and achieves enhanced generalizability into diverse downstream tasks, domain variations, and sensor-to-target distances.},

abstract = {Teaching software systems engineering is neither effective, nor inspiring if students cannot practice the conveyed theory. We report on a hands-on approach that closes the gap by means of off-the-shelf and in-house realistic miniature models of autonomous vehicles. It is innovative that the infrastructure extends beyond the widely-used solutions, to digitally controlled cars and trains, with open hardware and extendable sensory/actuating capabilities (cameras, opto-sensors, proximity sensors, LEDs, displays) operating in realistic mini-environments, including line-marked roads, railways, traffic-lights and -signs, tunnels and railroad switches. For many years already, we have been using these vehicles to structurally teach physical computing (300 undergraduates yearly) and systems testing (12 graduates yearly), and for incidental individual research projects. Recently, we started two initiatives that stimulate a more dynamic know-how transfer across generations. The first is a better scalable undergraduate capstone project, where groups of students work on a 'hot' research topic in autonomous driving. The second motivates student teams to go the extra mile in an international intelligent car race competition. Evaluations showed that although unusual for a non-engineering curriculum, 'playing' with autonomous vehicles is an excellent strategy to discover the interaction of software with hardware and environment, to better consolidate existing knowledge on programming and testing, and to explore new fields, such as AI-based computer vision, navigation and safety, adding in all cases more fun and motivation. We share the design of the scaffolding and teaching initiatives, together with lessons learned which will hopefully inspire other educators in shaping engaging and future-proof CS curricula.},

Bias can arise from biased data, algorithms, or data collection processes, making it crucial to develop methods that ensure fairness. This article introduces the Detect and Alleviate Bias (DAB) framework, a novel approach designed to identify and mitigate bias in ML models, focusing on sensitive attributes such as gender and race. The key contributions of DAB include: (1) a holistic pipeline that combines data pre-processing, model enhancement, situation testing, and bias mitigation techniques; (2) the application of Counterfactual Fairness testing to detect individual biases; and (3) the integration of multiple bias mitigation strategies to improve fairness in binary classification tasks. We demonstrate the practical implications of DAB through empirical experiments on two widely used datasets, showing that it reduces bias and improves fairness with a slight compromise in model performance, with a significant potential for making an impact in sensitive domains such as healthcare and criminal justice. The results show that pre-processing and post-processing mitigation techniques achieve the best improvements in fairness for unrepresentative datasets, while in-processing methods are more effective in enhancing fairness for representative datasets; however, an inverse relationship between model performance and fairness is observed.},

By combining omics data with other data types, such as electronic health record data, panomics research is actively attempting to uncover novel and potentially useful biomarkers. For the effective analysis of high-throughput-derived omics data, it is imperative to establish robust and reliable platforms that prioritize ethical considerations while effectively managing privacy, ownership concerns, and the responsible sharing of data. The GenShare model was proposed to provide an efficient platform that fits these needs. GenShare is a hybrid platform that utilizes blockchain technology. Paillier's homomorphic encryption scheme in tandem with Intel Software Guard Extension (SGX) serves to enable the sharing of genomic data, execution of count queries, and statistical analysis of genomic data while preserving privacy and avoiding compromise of sensitive information. The objective of this paradigm is to confront security and privacy concerns through the integration of homomorphic encryption and SGX, addressing additional challenges associated with Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum. In pursuit of this objective, the implementation of the system involved establishing the Hyperledger Fabric network, with various workloads employed to assess the network's efficiency. Consequently, it was hypothesized that the new GenShare model would enhance the data collection and dissemination cycle and serve as a proficient platform catering to the needs of its users.},

However, IoT-based smart irrigation systems make data-driven decisions, which can optimize crop yield and WUE; therefore, improving crop output and water conservation in agriculture. This study focuses on integrating IoT-based smart irrigation against traditional techniques that consider red amaranth cultivation. We developed the irrigation system using a microcontroller (ESP32) and various sensors (soil moisture, humidity, and temperature sensors). The impact of irrigation techniques on red amaranth growth and overall crop output was assessed using key characteristics like plant height, leaf count, area, fresh and dry weight, and water use efficiency. Results show that the IoT-based smart irrigation boosts crop yield by approximately 12\% while decreasing water usage by around 58\%.},

abstract = {Ensuring rapid and efficient in-clinic treatment, maintaining patient confidentiality, and developing automated pediatric seizure detection algorithms have been important objectives in epilepsy research. In recent decades, EEG has become a significant tool for neurologists to diagnose neurological disorders, particularly for detecting seizures. Seizures are unpredictable and can occur suddenly, making timely detection crucial. Given the sensitive nature of neurological data, it is essential to ensure data privacy. However, constructing an effective model requires a substantial amount of data, presenting a significant challenge. Thus, the primary objective of this research is to develop a precise and automated model for identifying pediatric seizures utilizing EEG data while preserving patient confidentiality. This study presents a novel framework called E-ResNet, employing a modified Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify seizure activity by ensembling ResNet-50 and ResNet-18. Additionally, federated learning for pediatric seizure detection is suggested to encourage a collaborative and privacy-aware methodology that can be employed in healthcare settings with numerous data sources. Utilizing the publicly available CHB-MIT database, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 99\%, 92.3\% F1-score and an AUC of 91\%. The proposed framework is an effective architecture for pediatric seizure detection that incorporates E-ResNet alongside CNN and federated learning techniques.},

abstract = {A line follower robot detects and follows a visual line on the floor. Enhancing it with obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensors transforms it from a basic system into an advanced autonomous robot capable of intelligent navigation. This paper presents the design and development of an STM32-based robot with both line-following and object-avoidance capabilities. The research is motivated by the robot’s versatile applications in military, delivery, transportation, and healthcare, as well as its potential to enhance public transport, industrial automation, household tasks, and safety in hazardous environments. Experimental results show that the robot can accurately follow lines and avoid real-time obstacles, though challenges remain with complex paths. This research offers a cost-effective solution for combining line-following and object-avoidance functionalities. Future research could explore advanced control algorithms and machine learning techniques to enhance navigation robustness and intelligence.},

abstract = {Humans spend almost one third of their entire lifetime sleeping. However, Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a condition identified as repeated occurrence of partial or complete obstruction of the airway while sleeping, resulting in numerous health complications. Traditional methods for OSA mostly depend on polysomnography (PSG) or manual scoring. But these are intensive in terms of resources and dependent on scorer variability. The study proposes a transformer-based approach for automated OSA event detection utilising electrocardiogram (ECG) data. Here, transformer neural network architecture has been optimized for time-series data, utilizing features extracted from single-lead ECG. Accuracy of 91.97\%, sensitivity of 90.45\%, specificity of 92.92\%, precision of 88.82\%, and F1 score of 0.8962 for PhysioNet Apnea-ECG dataset is achieved by our model. This novel application of deep learning technique could potentially improve the efficiency and accuracy of OSA diagnostics. The rise of AI processing power is currently happening, and our model can be applied to wearable devices for early detection of OSA on any typical individual without using PSG initially.},

abstract = {Fish is a main cuisine and a primary non-vegetarian food for the people of Bangladesh. Since Bangladesh is a riverine nation, fish can be found all over the place. Fish rots quickly, so the majority of fish must be preserved to meet the nutritional needs of the population. Sometimes, fish is imported and harvested from Bangladesh's rivers to feed the country's enormous population. Improper importers add formalin to their fish to keep it from spoiling during importation or international shipping. The effects of formalin on the human body are negative, causing a plethora of health issues, including cancer, miscarriages, tumors, etc. Therefore, it is crucial to identify fish that contain formalin and those that do not. Traditional methods of formalin detection rely on human senses, which can lead to incorrect results. Hence, a more dependable, automated method is required. Digital image processing has emerged as a potential tool for fish formalin detection in recent years. In this study, a complex application is proposed. Fish eyes can be used as the basis for an image processing system that distinguishes between formalin and non- formalin fish. One benefit of using digital image processing for formalin detection is that it offers a quick and discreet examination method. It can accurately and quickly detect formalin in fish photos without the need to prepare damaged samples. Digital image processing algorithms are more precise and consistent because they are not influenced by human biases or subjective assessments. The architectures we suggest are EfficientNET-B3 and VGG16. This system attained 100\% training accuracy and dataset validation. However, formalin detection via digital image processing is not without challenges. The variability in fish appearances is one of the main obstacles that could prevent the development of a robust and efficient image processing program. This also includes the influence of additional factors, such as lighting. This paper focuses on testing an existing method proposed for this purpose.},

abstract = {A stability chamber is essential for pharmaceutical facilities to test the stability and quality of products over time by exposing them to different environmental conditions. This paper introduces an IoT-enabled stability chamber designed for the pharmaceutical industry. We constructed four stability chambers by leveraging the existing infrastructure within a manufacturing facility. Each chamber is controlled using a state-of-the-art Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) system based on the Siemens S7-1200 PLC. The Siemens WinCC Runtime Advanced platform, compliant with FDA 21 CFR Part 11, was used for visualizing chamber data. Additionally, an Internet of Things (IoT) application was developed to remotely monitor sensor data through any client application. This research aims to enhance the performance of traditional stability chambers by integrating IoT functionalities, making them more cost-effective and user-friendly.},
