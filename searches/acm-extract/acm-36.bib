abstract = {Smart homes contain diverse sensors and actuators controlled by IoT apps that provide custom automation. Prior works showed that an adversary could exploit physical interaction vulnerabilities among apps and put the users and environment at risk, e.g., to break into a house, an adversary turns on the heater to trigger an app that opens windows when the temperature exceeds a threshold. Currently, the safe behavior of physical interactions relies on either app code analysis or dynamic analysis of device states with manually derived policies by developers. However, existing works fail to achieve sufficient breadth and fidelity to translate the app code into their physical behavior or provide incomplete security policies, causing poor accuracy and false alarms.  In this paper, we introduce a new approach, IoTSeer, which efficiently combines app code analysis and dynamic analysis with new security policies to discover physical interaction vulnerabilities. IoTSeer works by first translating sensor events and actuator commands of each app into a physical execution model (PeM) and unifying PeMs to express composite physical execution of apps (CPeM). CPeM allows us to deploy IoTSeer in different smart homes by defining its execution parameters with minimal data collection. IoTSeer supports new security policies with intended/unintended physical channel labels. It then efficiently checks them on the CPeM via falsification, which addresses the undecidability of verification due to the continuous and discrete behavior of IoT devices.  We evaluate IoTSeer in an actual house with 14 actuators, six sensors, and 39 apps. IoTSeer discovers 16 unique policy violations, whereas prior works identify only 2 out of 16 with 18 falsely flagged violations. IoTSeer only requires 30 mins of data collection for each actuator to set the CPeM parameters and is adaptive to newly added, removed, and relocated devices.},

abstract = {Bluetooth is a short-range wireless communication technology widely used by billions of personal computing, IoT, peripheral, and wearable devices. Bluetooth devices exchange commands and data, such as keyboard/mouse inputs, audio, and files, through a secure communication channel that is established through a pairing process. Due to the sensitivity of those commands and data, security mechanisms, such as encryption, authentication, and authorization, have been developed and adopted in the standards. Nevertheless, vulnerabilities continue to be discovered.  In the literature, few successful attacks against the Bluetooth connection establishment stage have been reported. Many attacks simply assume that connections are already established or use a compromised agent, e.g, a malicious app or a careless user, to initialize the connection. We argue that such assumptions are strong and impractical. A stealthily established connection is a critical starting point for any practical attack against Bluetooth devices. In this paper, we demonstrate that the Bluetooth Specification contains a series of vulnerabilities that will enable an attacker to impersonate a Bluetooth device and successfully establish a connection with a victim device. The entire process does not require any involvement of the device owner/user or any malicious app on the victim device. The attacker could further escalate permissions by switching Bluetooth profiles to retrieve sensitive information from the victim device and inject arbitrary commands. We name our new attack as the Blacktooth Attack. To demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the Blacktooth attack, we evaluate it against 21 different Bluetooth devices with diverse manufacturers and operating systems, and all major Bluetooth versions. We show that the newly proposed attack is successful on all victim devices.},

abstract = {A wide range of Arm endpoints leverage integrated and discrete GPUs to accelerate computation such as image processing and numerical processing applications. However, in spite of these important use cases, Arm GPU security has yet to be scrutinized by the community. By exploiting vulnerabilities in the kernel, attackers can directly access sensitive data used during GPU computing, such as personally-identifiable image data in computer vision tasks. Existing work has used Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to address GPU security concerns on Intel-based platforms, while there are numerous architectural differences that lead to novel technical challenges in deploying TEEs for Arm GPUs. In addition, extant Arm-based GPU defenses are intended for secure machine learning, and lack generality. There is a need for generalizable and efficient Arm-based GPU security mechanisms.To address these problems, we present StrongBox, the first GPU TEE for secured general computation on Arm endpoints. During confidential computation on Arm GPUs, StrongBox provides an isolated execution environment by ensuring exclusive access to the GPU. Our approach is based in part on a dynamic, fine-grained memory protection policy as Arm-based GPUs typically share a unified memory with the CPU, a stark contrast with Intel-based platforms. Furthermore, by characterizing GPU buffers as secure and non-secure, StrongBox reduces redundant security introspection operations to control access to sensitive data used by the GPU, ultimately reducing runtime overhead. Our design leverages the widely-deployed Arm TrustZone and generic Arm features, without hardware modification or architectural changes. We prototype StrongBox using an off-the-shelf Arm Mali GPU and perform an extensive evaluation. Our results show that StrongBox successfully ensures the GPU computing security with a low (4.70\% - 15.26\%) overhead across several indicative benchmarks.},

abstract = {Owner-centric control is a widely adopted method for easing owners' concerns over data abuses and motivating them to share their data out to gain collective knowledge. However, while many control enforcement techniques have been proposed, privacy threats due to the metadata leakage therein are largely neglected in existing works. Unfortunately, a sophisticated attacker can infer very sensitive information based on either owners' data control policies or their analytic task participation histories (e.g., participating in a mental illness or cancer study can reveal their health conditions). To address this problem, we introduce Vizard, a metadata-hiding analytic system that enables privacy-hardened and enforceable control for owners. Vizard is built with a tailored suite of lightweight cryptographic tools and designs that help us efficiently handle analytic queries over encrypted data streams coming in real-time (like heart rates). We propose extension designs to further enable advanced owner-centric controls (with AND, OR, NOT operators) and provide owners with release control to additionally regulate how the result should be protected before deliveries. We develop a prototype of Vizard that is interfaced with Apache Kafka, and the evaluation results demonstrate the practicality of Vizard for large-scale and metadata-hiding analytics over data streams.},

abstract = {Opportunities to evoke emotional experiences and modulate cognitive processes hold great importance in studying relations between emotion, cognition and behaviour as well as building technologies for maintaining positive mental health. We present the concept of Metasomatic Interactions as a new way of generating and controlling previously untapped embodied emotions using illusory sensations tuned to the prior bodily experiences. We present Frisson, a metasomatic interface built to elicit the sensations underlying the embodied emotion of aesthetic chills (i.e., goosebumps, psychogenic shivers). We present a user study (N = 14) in which the device evokes the psychogenic experience of aesthetic chills by simulating traversing thermal sensations across the spine when the illusory sensations overlap with the prior impression of aesthetic chills. The results encourage further testing of metasomatic interfaces for inducing emotions from the body. Using theories of embodied cognition, experimental results and this device, we present a discussion on characteristics of metasomatic interfaces, which we hope will inspire new categories of emotional prostheses in HCI.},

abstract = {We study the security of Probabilistic Data Structures (PDS) for handling Approximate Membership Queries (AMQ); prominent examples of AMQ-PDS are Bloom and Cuckoo filters. AMQ-PDS are increasingly being deployed in environments where adversaries can gain benefit from carefully selecting inputs, for example to increase the false positive rate of an AMQ-PDS. They are also being used in settings where the inputs are sensitive and should remain private in the face of adversaries who can access an AMQ-PDS through an API or who can learn its internal state by compromising the system running the AMQ-PDS.We develop simulation-based security definitions that speak to correctness and privacy of AMQ-PDS. Our definitions are general and apply to a broad range of adversarial settings. We use our definitions to analyse the behaviour of both Bloom filters and insertion-only Cuckoo filters. We show that these AMQ-PDS can be provably protected through replacement or composition of hash functions with keyed pseudorandom functions in their construction. We also examine the practical impact on storage size and computation of providing secure instances of Bloom and insertion-only Cuckoo filters.},

abstract = {Basic vital signs such as heart and respiratory rates (HR and RR) are essential bio-indicators. Their longitudinal in-home collection enables prediction and detection of disease onset and change, providing for earlier health intervention. In this article, we propose a robust, non-touch vital signs monitoring system using a pair of co-located Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) and depth sensors. By extensive manual examination, we identify four typical temporal and spectral signal patterns and their suitable vital sign estimators. We devise a probabilistic weighted framework (PWF) that quantifies evidence of these patterns to update the weighted combination of estimator output to track the vital signs robustly. We also design a “heatmap”-based signal quality detector to exclude the disturbed signal from inadvertent motions. To monitor multiple co-habiting subjects in-home, we build a two-branch long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to distinguish between individuals and their activities, providing activity context crucial to disambiguating critical from normal vital sign variability. To achieve reliable context annotation, we carefully devise the feature set of the consecutive skeletal poses from the depth data, and develop a probabilistic tracking model to tackle non-line-of-sight (NLOS) cases. Our experimental results demonstrate the robustness and superior performance of the individual modules as well as the end-to-end system for passive and context-aware vital sign monitoring.},

abstract = {Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) is one of the most successful game genres. MOBA games such as League of Legends have competitive environments where players race for their rank. In most MOBA games, a player's rank is determined by the match result (win or lose). It seems natural because of the nature of team play, but in some sense, it is unfair because the players who put a lot of effort lose their rank just in case of loss and some players even get free-ride on teammates' efforts in case of a win. To reduce the side-effects of the team-based ranking system and evaluate a player's performance impartially, we propose a novel embedding model that converts a player's actions into quantitative scores based on the actions' respective contribution to the team's victory. Our model is built using a sequence-based deep learning model with a novel loss function working on the team match. We showed that our model can evaluate a player's individual performance fairly and analyze the contributions of the player's respective actions.},

Deep neural networks, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have gained a lot of attention in HAR scenario. Despite exceptional performance, CNNs with heavy overhead is not the best option for HAR task due to the limitation of computing resource on embedded devices. As far as we know, there are many invalid filters in CNN that contribute very little to output. Simply pruning these invalid filters could effectively accelerate CNNs, but it inevitably hurts performance. In this article, we first propose a novel CNN for HAR that uses filter activation. In comparison with filter pruning that is motivated for efficient consideration, filter activation aims to activate these invalid filters from an accuracy boosting perspective. We perform extensive experiments on several public HAR datasets, namely, UCI-HAR&nbsp;(UCI), OPPORTUNITY&nbsp;(OPPO), UniMiB-SHAR&nbsp;(Uni), PAMAP2&nbsp;(PAM2), WISDM&nbsp;(WIS), and USC-HAD&nbsp;(USC), which show the superiority of the proposed method against existing state-of-the-art&nbsp;(SOTA) approaches.

Our ethnographic research suggests that while young people sense they can't “trust” AI, many are not sure how it works or how much control they have over its growing role in their lives. In this study, we attempt to answer the following questions: (1) What can we learn about young people's understanding of AI when they produce media with and about it? and (2) What are the design features of an ethics-centered pedagogy that promotes STEM engagement via AI? To answer these questions, we co-developed and documented three projects at YR Media, a national network of youth journalists and artists who create multimedia for public distribution. Participants are predominantly youth of color and those contending with economic and other barriers to full participation in STEM fields. Findings showed that by creating a learning ecology that centered the cultures and experiences of its learners while leveraging familiar tools for critical analysis, youth deepened their understanding of AI. Our study also showed that providing opportunities for youth to produce ethics-centered interactive stories interrogating invisibilized AI functionalities, and to release those stories to the public, empowered them to creatively express their understandings and apprehensions about AI.},

abstract = {Location and user information can be shared and interacted in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which bring many benefits to drivers and consumers. However, private issues become more acute as their data is outsourced to third parties. It is easy for sensitive information to be leaked in a big data environment. To solve these problems, a location data algorithm that satisfies Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is proposed to protect user privacy. In this paper, we use the randomized response mechanism to reconstruct the Laplace algorithm so that it satisfies LDP, perturbing the original location of each user from the client. The user location is clustered using k-means clustering algorithm, the perturbed data are noise reduced in the blockchain software development kit (SDK), and the noise reduced location data is uploaded to the blockchain network for storage through smart contracts. In addition, the effectiveness of the privacy protection mechanism is verified by comparative experiments. Compared with the existing privacy protection methods, the privacy protection mechanism not only can meet the privacy needs of users better, but also the noise reduction algorithm in the SDK can restore the original data and has higher data availability.},

abstract = {Researchers have been exploring how incorporating care-based interactions can change the user's attitude \&amp; relationship towards an interactive device. This is typically achieved through virtual care where users care for digital entities. In this paper, we explore this concept further by investigating how physical care for a living organism, embedded as a functional component of an interactive device, also changes user-device relationships. Living organisms differ as they require an environment conducive to life, which in our concept, the user is responsible for providing by caring for the organism (e.g., feeding it). We instantiated our concept by engineering a smartwatch that includes a slime mold that physically conducts power to a heart rate sensor inside the device, acting as a living wire. In this smartwatch, the availability of heart-rate sensing depends on the health of the slime mold—with the user's care, the slime mold becomes conductive and enables the sensor; conversely, without care, the slime mold dries and disables the sensor (resuming care resuscitates the slime mold). To explore how our living device was perceived by users, we conducted a study where participants wore our slime mold-integrated smartwatch for 9-14 days. We found that participants felt a sense of responsibility, developed a reciprocal relationship, and experienced the organism's growth as a source of affect. Finally, to allow engineers and designers to expand on our work, we abstract our findings into a set of technical and design recommendations when engineering an interactive device that incorporates this type of care-based relationship.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of consumer-level virtual reality (VR) devices, users started experiencing VR in less controlled environments, such as in social gatherings and public areas. While the current VR hardware provides an increasingly immersive experience, it ignores stimuli originating from the physical surroundings that distract users from the VR experience. To block distractions from the outside world, many users wear noise-canceling headphones. However, this is insufficient to block loud or transient sounds (e.g., drilling or hammering) and, especially, multi-modal distractions (e.g., air drafts, temperature shifts from an A/C, construction vibrations, or food smells). To tackle this, we explore a new concept, where we directly integrate the distracting stimuli from the user's physical surroundings into their virtual reality experience to enhance presence. Using our approach, an otherwise distracting wind gust can be directly mapped to the sway of trees in a VR experience that already contains trees. Using our novel approach, we demonstrate how to integrate a range of distractive stimuli into the VR experience, such as haptics (temperature, vibrations, touch), sounds, and smells. To validate our approach, we conducted three user studies and a technical evaluation. First, to validate our key principle, we conducted a controlled study where participants were exposed to distractions while playing a VR game. We found that our approach improved users’ sense of presence, compared to wearing noise-canceling headphones. From these results, we engineered a sensing module that detects a set of simple distractive signals (e.g., sounds, winds, and temperature shifts). We validated our hardware in a technical evaluation and in an out-of-lab study where participants played VR games in an uncontrolled environment. Moreover, to gather the perspective of VR content creators that might one day utilize a system inspired by our findings, we invited game designers to use our approach and collected their feedback and VR designs. Finally, we present design considerations for mapping distracting external stimuli and discuss ethical considerations of integrating real-world stimuli into virtual reality.},

abstract = {Human environments are physically supported by floors, which prevent people and furniture from gravitational pull. Since our body motions continuously generate vibrations and loads that propagate into the ground, measurement of these expressive signals leads to unobtrusive activity sensing. In this study, we present Flexel, a modular floor interface for room-scale tactile sensing. By paving a room with floor interfaces, our system can immediately begin to infer touch locations, track user locations, recognize foot gestures, and detect object locations. Through a series of exploratory studies, we determined the preferable hardware design that adheres to construction conventions, as well as the optimal sensor density that mediates the trade-off between cost and performance. We summarize our findings into design guidelines that are generalizable to other floor interfaces. Finally, we provide example applications for room-scale tactile sensing enabled by our Flexel system.},

abstract = {Web search is increasingly used to satisfy complex, exploratory information goals. Exploring and synthesizing information into knowledge can be slow and cognitively demanding due to a disconnect between search tools and sense-making workspaces. Our work explores how we might integrate contextual query suggestions within a person’s sensemaking environment. We developed InterWeave a prototype that leverages a human wizard to generate contextual search guidance and to place the suggestions within the emergent structure of a searchers’ notes. To investigate how weaving suggestions into the sensemaking workspace affects a user’s search and sensemaking behavior, we ran a between-subjects study (n=34) where we compare InterWeave’s in context placement with a conventional list of query suggestions. InterWeave’s approach not only promoted active searching, information gathering and knowledge discovery, but also helped participants keep track of new suggestions and connect newly discovered information to existing knowledge, in comparison to presenting suggestions as a separate list. These results point to directions for future work to interweave contextual and natural search guidance into everyday work.},

abstract = {Forward biomechanical simulation in HCI holds great promise as a tool for evaluation, design, and engineering of user interfaces. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has been used to simulate biomechanics in interaction, prior work has relied on unrealistic assumptions about the control problem involved, which limits the plausibility of emerging policies. These assumptions include direct torque actuation as opposed to muscle-based control; direct, privileged access to the external environment, instead of imperfect sensory observations; and lack of interaction with physical input devices. In this paper, we present a new approach for learning muscle-actuated control policies based on perceptual feedback in interaction tasks with physical input devices. This allows modelling of more realistic interaction tasks with cognitively plausible visuomotor control. We show that our simulated user model successfully learns a variety of tasks representing different interaction methods, and that the model exhibits characteristic movement regularities observed in studies of pointing. We provide an open-source implementation which can be extended with further biomechanical models, perception models, and interactive environments.},

abstract = {Real-time tracking of a user’s hands, arms and environment is valuable in a wide variety of HCI applications, from context awareness to virtual reality. Rather than rely on fixed and external tracking infrastructure, the most flexible and consumer-friendly approaches are mobile, self-contained, and compatible with popular device form factors (e.g., smartwatches). In this vein, we contribute DiscoBand, a thin sensing strap not exceeding 1 cm in thickness. Sensors operating so close to the skin inherently face issues with occlusion. To help overcome this, our strap uses eight distributed depth sensors imaging the hand from different viewpoints, creating a sparse 3D point cloud. An additional eight depth sensors image outwards from the band to track the user’s body and surroundings. In addition to evaluating arm and hand pose tracking, we also describe a series of supplemental applications powered by our band’s data, including held object recognition and environment mapping.},

abstract = {Haptic feedback not only enhances immersion in virtual reality (VR) but also delivers experts’ haptic sensation tips in VR training, e.g.,&nbsp;properly clamping a tenon and mortise joint or tightening a screw in the assembly of VR factory training, which could even improve the training performance. However, various and complicated manipulation is in different scenarios. Although haptic feedback of virtual objects’ shape, stiffness or resistive force in pressing or grasping is achieved by previous research, rotational resistive force when twisting or turning virtual objects is seldom discussed or explored, especially for a wearable device. Therefore, we propose a wearable device, ELAXO, to integrate continuous resistive force and continuous rotational resistive force with or without resilience in grasping and twisting, respectively. ELAXO is an exoskeleton with rings, mechanical brakes and elastic bands. The brakes achieve shape rendering and switch between with and without resilience modes for the resistive force. The detachable and rotatable rings and elastic bands render continuous resistive force in grasping and twisting. We conducted a just noticeable difference (JND) study to understand users’ distinguishability in the four conditions, resistive force and rotational resistive force with and without resilience, separately. A VR study was then performed to verify that the versatile resistive force feedback from ELAXO enhances the VR experiences.},

abstract = {Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a microwave remote sensing imaging radar that reduces interference from imaging constraints such as climate. It has all-weather, all-weather imaging characteristics, and can obtain rich information representing the physical properties of real objects on the surface. Widely used in the field of modern economic development. With the rapid development of modern urbanization, the types and numbers of supporting roads and bridges are constantly increasing, and they are constantly developing and changing every year. Therefore, it is very important to detect highway bridges with high-resolution SAR images that can cover a large area. Development is of great significance and has broad prospects for development. In this paper, the detection of roads and bridges in single-polarization high-resolution SAR images and the connection of global road networks are studied. The scattering characteristics of urban roads, bridges and nearby objects under the condition of single polarization SAR imaging are analyzed, and the effects of different environments and materials on the results of the target appearing on the image are studied. According to the inherent properties of the road and bridge targets and the imaging features in the SAR image, the multi-angle feature extraction of the target to be detected is further carried out, which lays the foundation for the subsequent road and bridge detection.},

abstract = {TLS certificate pinning is a security mechanism used by applications (apps) to protect their network traffic against malicious certificate authorities (CAs), in-path monitoring, and other methods of TLS tampering. Pinning can provide enhanced security to defend against malicious third-party access to sensitive data in transit (e.g., to protect sensitive banking and health care information), but can also hide an app's personal data collection from users and auditors. Prior studies found pinning was rarely used in the Android ecosystem, except in high-profile, security-sensitive apps; and, little is known about its usage on iOS and across mobile platforms.In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the use of certificate pinning on Android and iOS. We collect 5,079 unique apps from the two official app stores: 575 common apps, 1,000 popular apps each, and 1,000 randomly selected apps each. We develop novel, cross-platform, static and dynamic analysis techniques to detect the usage of certificate pinning. Thus, our study offers a more comprehensive understanding of certificate pinning than previous studies.We find certificate pinning as much as 4 times more widely adopted than reported in recent studies. More specifically, we find that 0.9\% to 8\% of Android apps and 2.5\% to 11\% of iOS apps use certificate pinning at run time (depending on the aforementioned sets of apps). We then investigate which categories of apps most frequently use pinning (e.g., apps in the "finance" category), which destinations are typically pinned (e.g., first-party destinations vs those used by third-party libraries), which certificates are pinned and how these are pinned (e.g., CA vs leaf certificates), and the connection security for pinned connections vs unpinned ones (e.g., the use of weak ciphers or improper certificate validation). Lastly, we investigate how many pinned connections are amenable to binary instrumentation to reveal the contents of their connections; for those that are, we analyze the data sent over pinned connections to understand what is protected by pinning.},

abstract = {As more and more mobile/embedded applications employ Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) involving sensitive user data, mobile/embedded devices must provide a highly secure DNN execution environment to prevent privacy leaks. Aimed at securing DNN data, recent studies execute part of a DNN in a trusted execution environment (e.g., TrustZone) to isolate DNN execution from the other processes; however, as the trusted execution environments for mobile/embedded devices provide limited memory protection, DNN data remain unencrypted in DRAM and become vulnerable to physical attacks. The devices can prevent the physical attacks by keeping DNN data encrypted in DRAM; when DNN data get referenced during DNN execution, they get loaded to the SRAM and get decrypted by a CPU core. Unfortunately, using the SRAM with demand paging greatly increases DNN execution time due to the inefficient use of the SRAM and the high CPU consumption of data encryption/decryption.In this paper, we present GuardiaNN, a fast and secure DNN framework which greatly accelerates DNN execution without sacrificing security guarantees. To accelerate secure DNN execution, GuardiaNN first reduces slow DRAM accesses with direct convolutions and maximizes the reuse of SRAM-stored data with DNN-friendly SRAM management. Then, aimed at dedicating the limited CPU resources to DNN execution, GuardiaNN offloads DNN data encryption/decryption onto secure cryptographic hardware and employs pipelining to overlap DNN execution with the encryption/decryption. For eight DNNs chosen from five representative mobile/embedded application domains, our implementation of GuardiaNN on STM32MP157C-DK2 development board achieves a geomean speedup of 15.3x and a geomean energy efficiency improvement of 15.2x over a baseline secure DNN framework which employs demand-paged SRAM to secure sensitive data.},

To that end, we present Celestial, a virtual testbed for the LEO edge based on microVMs. Celestial can efficiently emulate individual satellites and their movement as well as ground station servers with realistic network conditions and in an application-agnostic manner, which we show empirically. Additionally, we explore opportunities and implications of deploying a real-time remote sensing application on LEO edge infrastructure in a case study on Celestial.},

abstract = {Healthcare has undergone a rapid shift from traditional to smart health care system in recent times. The new paradigm takes a patient-centered approach and offers a variety of benefits to patients. Rapid technological developments have allowed for such a quick shift. The Internet of medical things (IoMT) is a key component of the development of smart health care systems. The current pandemic situation has demonstrated that IoMT systems can provide a quick patient diagnosis by continually monitoring their health and perhaps saving lives in the event of an emergency. But most IoMT devices were not built with security in mind, making them vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Furthermore, many gadgets such as smart sensors, wearable devices, handheld devices, and a variety of other heterogeneous devices being connected in a network for the smooth running of communication in healthcare make this system more vulnerable to security and privacy attacks. Security of IoMT devices and data is of paramount importance and critical to protecting the lives of patients. This survey attempts to explore applications of various recent technologies, particularly blockchain, PUFs, and AI/ML, in terms of security, privacy, protection, integrity, and authentication in IoMT ecosystem. In addition, insights into the benefits and limitations of existing security and privacy solutions have been provided.},

The bias can be unethical, mainly when the data contains sensitive attributes, such as sex, race, age, etc. Some approaches have contributed to mitigating such biases by providing bias metrics and mitigation algorithms. The challenge is users have to implement their code in general/statistical programming languages, which can be demanding for users with little programming and fairness in machine learning experience. We present FairML, a model-based approach to facilitate bias measurement and mitigation with reduced software development effort. Our evaluation shows that FairML requires fewer lines of code to produce comparable measurement values to the ones produced by the baseline code.},

abstract = {The Remote ID is a rule proposed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the United States to provide a safer environment for drones. It consists of broadcasting standard messages containing sensitive drone information, for instance, its identity and location. However, this rule can be a threat to the drones' privacy since the information is broadcast as cleartext, and any device with a Remote ID module can store the data. In this study, we technically demonstrate that Remote ID is a risk to the drone's location privacy, mainly in the envisioned Internet of Drones (IoD) scenario. We design a location-based attack to track the drone's trajectory based on the Remote ID message. We highlight that the attack can correctly identify more than 90\% of a drone's trajectory through extensive simulations. Furthermore, we discuss that existent IoD protection mechanisms meet the Remote ID specification and can be applied as an enhanced version of this protocol. Indeed, our results also reveal that these mechanisms can mitigate the attack's success, providing a proper level of location privacy.},

abstract = {In the age of technology, data is an increasingly important resource. This importance is growing in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), where sub fields such as Machine Learning (ML) need more and more data to achieve better results. Internet of Things (IoT) is the connection of sensors and smart objects to collect and exchange data, in addition to achieving many other tasks. A huge amount of the resource desired, data, is stored in mobile devices, sensors and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices, but remains there due to data protection restrictions. At the same time these devices do not have enough data or computational capacity to train good models. Moreover, transmitting, storing and processing all this data on a centralised server is problematic. Federated Learning (FL) provides an innovative solution that allows devices to learn in a collaborative way. More importantly, it accomplishes this without violating data protection laws. FL is currently growing, and there are several solutions that implement it. This article presents a prototype of a FL solution where the IoT devices used were raspberry pi boards. The results compare the performance of a solution of this type with those obtained in traditional approaches. In addition, the FL solution performance was tested in a hostile environment. A convolutional neural network (CNN) and a image data set were used. The results show the feasibility and usability of these techniques, although in many cases they do not reach the performance of traditional approaches.},

abstract = {Fall detection is one of the main issues for the elder's health care systems because of its economic and social impact. Whereas the primary metric of such a system remains its accuracy in terms of good detection of falls and avoiding either false detection or missing detection, its deployment raises many issues in terms of the number of devices, their nature (scalar, multimedia, Lidar, etc.) and the technique used. Generally, techniques based on multimedia processing provide better results but at the expense of a high CPU processing and consequently need appropriate devices. This paper explores an approach that uses less-powerful affordable devices (i.e., Raspberry Pi like) with multimedia sensors (i.e., Kinect) and a Deep Learning-based processing mechanism. More precisely, we applied LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) on features extracted from the time series data acquired from the Kinect. Experimental results we obtained from our lightweight LSTM model on the Raspberry pi show that geometric features are more relevant for fall event detection. Our model achieves advanced performance with metrics that are usually considered (accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity). Furthermore, our lightweight model is very promising for deployment on machines considered "low-cost."},

In this paper, we show the advantages of an alternative participant-controlled transparent data collection approach. The paper combines a detailed experimental real world study with a best-practice report. We study the discrepancy between the transparency in the data collection process and the quality of the data collected in the context of mobile crowdsensing (MCS), a paradigm which leverages sensing data from the mobile devices of private individuals. We focus on applications where environmental data is collected and private user data in itself should not have any additional benefit. We treat the concrete example of MCS of tempo-spatial data for the creation of a thematic map of noise levels. We present a lightweight transparent online scheduling approach of opt-in requests for data collection for the users. Within the framework of a real world study, we show that our approach is competitive and results in an improved workload balance among users. We also present data on the responsiveness of users to requests.},

abstract = {IoT or sensor network is a high-responsibility network implemented in a real-time environment. The sensor network is equipped with sensors or smart devices to capture environmental or object information. Each sensor device is placed with distinct responsibility and behaviour. Even though, these sensor nodes are restricted by limited energy, low sensing range, and environmental challenges. These challenges increase when the network is dynamic and has some coverage issues. The coverage issues can occur in the existence of obstacles, weak communication medium, and a lesser degree of nodes in a scattered network. The performance optimization in such a coverage critical network is very challenging. The traditional clustering protocols divide the network into smaller segments to optimize network communication and life. But the network nodes or controllers do not be concerned about the position, coverage, and connectivity of nodes. In this paper, a three-stage function process is with the proposed CLLEACH protocol to optimize the behaviour of conventional and recent clustering protocols. This proposed protocol integrates the localization method within the conventional clustering protocol to increase the bonding within the clustered region. The distance, energy, and connectivity parameters are used collectively to identify the controller nodes. In the final stage, Min-Max-Max (MMM) rule-based hierarchical routing is applied to deliver the captured information to the base station. The proposed protocol is simulated in a dense sensor network and analyzed against LEACH, CLEACH, and MLEACH protocols. The comparative and analysis results identify that the proposed protocol has improved network life and communication. The network life is significantly improved by 33.63\% against LEACH, 30.09\% AGAINST CLEACH, and 10.62\% against MLEACH protocols. As the network life and communication reliability are improved, packet communication is increased by 30.99\% against LEACH, 21.50\% against CLEACH, and 8.44\% against MLEACH protocols.},

abstract = {The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a lightweight communication protocol designed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for wireless sensor networks and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. The reliability mechanism in CoAP is based on retransmissions after timeout expiration and on an exponential backoff procedure which is designed to be simple and adapted to constrained devices. In this research work, we propose a new exact analytical model to analyze the performance of CoAP in lossy wireless networks modeled by the well-known Gilbert-Elliott two-state Markov process. We also show how to compute several performance metrics using closed form expressions such as the observed loss ratio, goodput, and the delay before success with a time complexity no more than O(r) with r is the maximum re-transmission limit. This study provides insights about improving CoAP recovery mechanism and highlights the properties -- including the limitations -- of CoAP. Also, it presents guidelines to tune CoAP parameters dynamically in order to adapt to network losses caused by interference and mobility. The model is validated using the realistic environment Cooja/Contiki OS where theoretical and experimental results match very well.},

abstract = {Wireless Sensor Nodes have become crucial part of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications currently being designed. Many innovative and practical solutions are given to the problems which belongs to heterogenous and integrated domains. With aggressive use of wireless sensors in IIoT environments, concern of security has increased. As communications between the devices in IIoT environment involve exchange of information that is crucial and sensitive which must be secure transactions. Many security protocols have been proposed using various cryptographic techniques, but there is extra constraint on computational resources of sensor devices which makes it difficult to apply standard security protocols. In this paper, we proposed a security protocol in which we use hierarchal architecture of wireless sensor networks. A group of devices in a region are considered as a cluster, each cluster contains a Cluster Head through which a sensor device requests a token from server for mutual authentication both in inter/intra cluster environment. This token contains combined computed hash of Identity of Device, Cluster Head and Server along with random number generated by device. This token-based authentication provides secure communication between devices because of added validity and timestamps in the event of any attack. This proposed protocol is verified as safe by BAN logic and AVISPA.},

In order to protect user privacy while training machine learning models with multiple datasets, federated learning (FL) is introduced. Due to the heterogeneity of different IoT devices, the client selection method may greatly impact the performance of federated learning. In this paper, we introduce an enhanced version of our previous approach to address the client selection issue in a realistic FL environment. The proposed method considers the number of local data, computing capability, and network resources of each client participating in FL based on fuzzy logic. Then, the most suitable clients are selected for federated learning to get higher performance. Moreover, we use Raspberry Pi and laptops as FL clients and verify the superiority of the proposed method through extensive experiments.},

abstract = {Advancements and easier access to technology has led to a greater demand for applications whose interaction is performed through voice recognition, since multimedia content has been a valuable source for computational analysis. In this sense, vocal representations are extracted for various purposes in applications in several areas such as convenience, accessibility, security and sentiment analysis. The main challenge of speech recognition lies in the variability of speakers, environments, devices and the presence of disfluencies during spoken speech. These aspects influence transcription tools, essential when the user requires interaction through voice, aiming at producing texts from this interaction. In particular, detection of disfluencies can help to identify aspects related to the emotional status of the speaker. This work presents an analysis of text transcription tools, with focus in disfluency detection, encompassing the metrics most used for evaluation and databases used in evaluations in the context of Brazilian Portuguese. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the performance of three tools (IBM Watson, Google Speech and Vosk). The Google Speech tool achieved the best performance with average Word Error Rate of 9.69\% for fluent sentences and 17.15\% for disfluent sentences, followed by IBM Watson with 11.86\% and 23.44\% and Vosk with 14.39 \% and 22.56\% respectively.},

As wearable device becomes an important player in the mobile market, an indoor localization system tailored specifically for it remains absent. In this paper, we present SwingLoc, an indoor positioning system aimed particularly for hand-wear devices. It takes use of the natural arm swinging when the user is walking, and the Doppler effects it triggers while receiving acoustic signals to locate the user. With the need of off-the-shelf speakers, which are already present in most public indoor areas, SwingLoc monitors the wearable device's direction toward the speakers in consecutive gait cycles, and solve a nonlinear least squares problem for the user's position. Our real-world tests involving 6 users at two different locations shows that SwingLoc can achieve overall 85\% localization errors under 2m, with extreme conditions where at most 3 speakers are present in the environment. Our experiments demonstrate SwingLoc to be robust and effective, and has great potential for providing fine-grained location-based services and improve human well-being.},

abstract = {Machine learning on source code (MLOnCode) is a popular research field that has been driven by the availability of large-scale code repositories and the development of powerful probabilistic and deep learning models for mining source code. Code-to-code recommendation is a task in MLOnCode that aims to recommend relevant, diverse and concise code snippets that usefully extend the code currently being written by a developer in their development environment (IDE). Code-to-code recommendation engines hold the promise of increasing developer productivity by reducing context switching from the IDE and increasing code-reuse. Existing code-to-code recommendation engines do not scale gracefully to large codebases, exhibiting a linear growth in query time as the code repository increases in size. In addition, existing code-to-code recommendation engines fail to account for the global statistics of code repositories in the ranking function, such as the distribution of code snippet lengths, leading to sub-optimal retrieval results. We address both of these weaknesses with Senatus, a new code-to-code recommendation engine. At the core of Senatus is De-Skew LSH a new locality sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm that indexes the data for fast (sub-linear time) retrieval while also counteracting the skewness in the snippet length distribution using novel abstract syntax tree-based feature scoring and selection algorithms. We evaluate Senatus and find the recommendations to be of higher quality than competing baselines, while achieving faster search. For example on the CodeSearchNet dataset Senatus improves performance by 31.21\% F1 and 147.9x faster query time compared to Facebook Aroma. Senatus also outperforms standard MinHash LSH by 29.2\% F1 and 51.02x faster query time.},

abstract = {Next-generation wireless networks will leverage the spectrum above 100 GHz to enable ultra-high data rate communications over multi-GHz-wide bandwidths. The propagation environment at such high frequencies, however, introduces challenges throughout the whole protocol stack design, from physical layer signal processing to application design. Therefore, it is fundamental to develop a holistic understanding of the channel propagation and fading characteristics over realistic deployment scenarios and ultra-wide bands. In this paper, we conduct an extensive measurement campaign to evaluate the impact of weather conditions on a wireless link in the 130-150 GHz band through a channel sounding campaign with clear weather, rain, and snow in a typical urban backhaul scenario. We present a novel channel sounder design that captures signals with -82 dBm sensitivity and 20 GHz of bandwidth.We analyze link budget, capacity, as well as channel parameters such as the delay spread and the K-factor. Our experimental results indicate that in the considered context the adverse weather does not interrupt the link, but introduces some additional constraints (e.g., high delay spread and increase in path loss in snow conditions) that need to be accounted for in the design of reliable Sixth Generation (6G) communication links above 100 GHz.},

abstract = {High-speed communication and accurate sensing are of vital importance for future transportation system. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system has the advantages of high spectrum efficiency and low hardware cost, satisfying the requirements of sensing and communication. Therefore, ISAC is considered to be a promising technology in the future transportation system. However, due to the low transmit power of signal and the influence of harsh transmission environment on radar sensing, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) at the radar receiver is low, which affects the sensing performance. This paper introduces the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) into ISAC system. With IRS composed of M sub-surfaces implemented on the surface of the target. The SNR at the radar receiver is 20lg(M) times larger than the scheme without IRS. Correspondingly, radar detection probability is significantly improved, and Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for ranging and velocity estimation is reduced. This paper proves the efficiency of IRS enabled ISAC system, which motivates the implementation of IRS to enhance the sensing capability in ISAC system.},

Since they can operate in different environments, it is possible to encounter uncertainties and exceptional situations, not initially predicted, during the use of drone-based applications. In this realm, self-adaptive strategies have been successfully used to guarantee resilience and continuous execution of such applications despite environment changes. Although some modelling approaches emerged to represent drone concepts, they are limited to model only expected flight plans or include few environmental conditions and drone resources, which restrict considerably their use. To mitigate those problems, this work proposes a domain-specific language, called DRESS-ML, which allows modelling exceptional situations and self-adaptive behaviours for drone-based applications. It relies on the Given-When-Then template used in the Behaviour-driven development (BDD) technique and the some of the main Aspect-oriented Programming concepts. We validate the applicability of our language through a proof of concept regarding an example application that uses a drone to monitor a forest to search for fire spots.Drones are gaining attention due to their possibility of supporting diverse applications and environments, such as search-and-rescue, surveillance, and goods delivery. Due to this variety of applications, drones can face both uncertainties and exceptional situations that they did not initially foresee during flight plan. In this sense, providing the ability to monitor the system and its environment and to change the system to ensure resilience and continuous execution are benefits of self-adaptation strategies. Although some studies have proposed approaches to model drone concepts, they are limited to model only expected flight plans or include few environmental conditions and drone resources, which restrict considerably their use. This work proposes a domain-specific language, called DRESS-ML, which allows modelling exceptional scenarios and self-adaptive behaviors to mitigate those problems. The language is based on an well known structure used for specifying system behaviour and the main concepts of a programming paradigm that injects encapsulated behaviours in the system. A practical example that uses a drone to monitor a forest to search for fire spots is used to evaluate the proposed language, demonstrating its applicability to model various exceptional scenarios.},

abstract = {Notebooks provide an interactive environment for programmers to develop code, analyse data and inject interleaved visualisations in a single environment. Despite their flexibility, a major pitfall that data scientists encounter is unexpected behaviour caused by the unique out-of-order execution model of notebooks. As a result, data scientists face various challenges ranging from notebook correctness, reproducibility and cleaning. In this paper, we propose a framework that performs static analysis on notebooks, incorporating their unique execution semantics. Our framework is general in the sense that it accommodates a wide range of analyses, useful for various notebook use cases. We have instantiated our framework on a diverse set of analyses and have evaluated them on 2211 real world notebooks. Our evaluation demonstrates that the vast majority (98.7\%) of notebooks can be analysed in less than a second, well within the time frame required by interactive notebook clients.},

abstract = {Accidental fall is one of the major factors threatening the health of the elderly, which promotes the considerable development of fall detection technology. In our study, a novel method is proposed to detect falls prior to impact during walking. In terms of data collection, acceleration and angular velocity data are collected using a single sensor. By extracting distinctive features, our design goal is to accurately identify fall behavior at an early stage. To improve detection accuracy and reduce false alarms, a classifier based on the joint feature of accelerations and Euler angles (JFAE) analysis is developed. With the support vector machine (SVM) classifier, human activities are classified into eight categories: going upstairs, going downstairs, running, walking, falling forward, falling backward, falling left, and falling right. Not only can it achieve a sensitivity of 96.8\% and precision of 96.75\%, but also the method we proposed can achieve a high accuracy for the classifier. Compared with the method based on single feature, the method based on multiple features achieves a better performance. The preliminary results indicate that our study has potential application in a fall injury prevention system.},

abstract = {Although the current pandemic is expected to eventually end, similar outbreaks of viral disease may occur in the future. Such outbreaks can spread through direct social contact. To avoid such risks, we propose contactless interaction using an eye-tracking device. The proposed approach uses a conventional visible-light camera to detect a user’s iris. The camera is attached to a wearable frame. We believe that our proposed method is safer than exposing a user’s eyes to an infrared sensor at a close distance. Furthermore, we considered seamless multi-device control using the proposed device. The system utilizes QR codes to switch between controlled devices. Once the eye-tracking device detects a QR code, it connects to a target device and sends commands to control it. These commands are triggered by eye movement gestures performed by the user. We defined these control gestures as a simple straight eye movement in a given direction, to avoid the potential burden of requiring complex gestures. We experimentally implemented the proposed device, and the results show that it achieved an overall accuracy of 81.66\%. Thus, it may prove useful for multitasking applications or for contactless interaction.},

abstract = {While the global healthcare market of wearable devices has been growing significantly in recent years and is predicted to reach $60 billion by 2028, many important healthcare applications such as seizure monitoring, drowsiness detection, etc. have not been deployed due to the limited battery lifetime, slow response rate, and inadequate biosignal quality.This study proposes PROS, an efficient pattern-driven compressive sensing framework for low-power biopotential-based wearables. PROS eliminates the conventional trade-off between signal quality, response time, and power consumption by introducing tiny pattern recognition primitives and a pattern-driven compressive sensing technique that exploits the sparsity of biosignals. Specifically, we (i) develop tiny machine learning models to eliminate irrelevant biosignal patterns, (ii) efficiently perform compressive sampling of relevant biosignals with appropriate sparse wavelet domains, and (iii) optimize hardware and OS operations to push processing efficiency. PROS also provides an abstraction layer, so the application only needs to care about detected relevant biosignal patterns without knowing the optimizations underneath.We have implemented and evaluated PROS on two open biosignal datasets with 120 subjects and six biosignal patterns. The experimental results on unknown subjects of a practical use case such as epileptic seizure monitoring are very encouraging. PROS can reduce the streaming data rate by 24X while maintaining high fidelity signal. It boosts the power efficiency of the wearable device by more than 1200\% and enables the ability to react to critical events immediately on the device. The memory and runtime overheads of PROS are minimal, with a few KBs and 10s of milliseconds for each biosignal pattern, respectively. PROS is currently adopted in research projects in multiple universities and hospitals.},
