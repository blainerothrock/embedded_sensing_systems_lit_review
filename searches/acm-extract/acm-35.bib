abstract = {In the past few years mobile Adhoc network(MANET) has been widely applied in a range of fields like road safety, sensors for the environment, home, health, disaster rescue operations, defense, weapons, robots, IOT applications etc. In this era of internet of things more and more mobile devices are needed to be interconnected via internet. Security for these networks is a big concern as MANET has no centralized infrastructure and totally dynamic in nature. So, to maintain the network security, we are proposing an algorithm which will help to ensure secure communications by a two phase security check. In the first phase the trust value of the nodes will be calculated and the secure nodes will be the input for the second phase. In the second phase with the help of cuckoo search algorithm, the routing will be done. The cuckoo search algorithm helps to select optimized route based on the QoS factors, which guarantees reliability and longer network lifetime. In this paper, we are proposing an optimization scheme for secure routing in MANET based on cuckoo search algorithm in which the fitness will be the security of the nodes.},

abstract = {“Save the environment for the people by the people”Plethora of works have been carried out with meteorological data like humidity, temperature, barometer pressure, wind speed, and weather conditions, which can be mined from different web sources. Air quality data, such as the concentration of PM2.5, NO2, and SO2, can be obtained from air quality monitoring stations. Presence of some gasses like CO2 and CO can even be detected by portable sensors. Air quality is represented by an Air Quality Index (AQI) and a category, for example, good, average, and unhealthy. Urban air quality varies significantly by location and changes tremendously over time due to the impact of multiple factors such as traffic flow, land usage, population density, huge industrialization and rapid urbanization. As a consequence, a) limited number of monitoring stations cannot reveal the fine-grained air quality throughout a city. b) inadequate environment information in suburban cities and rural zones is not enough c) system fails to capture the proper reasons for poor air quality, c) extraction of raw environment data is difficult for further development of any application. Straightway collection of real-time air quality data and continuous monitoring of environment is challenging for low economic countries. Therefore our objective is to generate the air profile of city road segments based on the actual demographic context of the city zones and developing a system which enables collection of raw sensor information from smartphone users and to identify the actual context of the location. Using the multi-modal information CityAirProfile, identifies a set of granular contextual features that allow the system to differentiate among the different air quality types. A thorough analysis of city context using the collected in-house dataset indicates that the system works with high accuracy in identifying different city zones like regular crowded area, commercial area or traffic congestion where air quality varies significantly. Therefore, we have identified the subjective city factors and analyzed the ambient city features like traffic flow, population density, demographic characteristics, load of vehicles on road, plantation type and road geometry which have high impact on the air quality. These features will be useful to develop the air profile for a particular city zone. We have classified the air profile of a city zone based on these subjective features. This city air profile will be useful to develop any kind of environment-aware utility services for people of low and poor economic countries.},

abstract = {For Internet of Vehicles applications, reliable autonomous driving systems usually perform the majority of their computations on the cloud due to the limited computing power of edge devices. The communication delay between cloud platforms and edge devices, however, can cause dangerous consequences, particularly for latency-sensitive object detection tasks. Object detection tasks are also vulnerable to significantly degraded model performance caused by unknown objects, which creates unsafe driving conditions. To address these problems, this study develops an orchestrated system that allows real-time object detection and incrementally learns unknown objects in a complex and dynamic environment. A you-only-look-once–based object detection model in edge computing mode uses thermal images to detect objects accurately in poor lighting conditions. In addition, an attention mechanism improves the system’s performance without significantly increasing model complexity. An unknown object detector automatically classifies and labels unknown objects without direct supervision on edge devices, while a roadside unit (RSU)-based mechanism is developed to update classes and ensure a secure driving experience for autonomous vehicles. Moreover, the interactions between edge devices, RSU servers, and the cloud are designed to allow efficient collaboration. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system learns uncategorized objects dynamically and detects instances accurately.},

abstract = {Movement ecology is a relatively new discipline in the field of ecology that studies the spatio-temporal patterns and processes at the basis of animal movement [8]. Ecologists track animal movement using telemetry tools (such as for example bio-logging GPS tags), and then combine resulting trajectories with contextual data on environment, such as those collected through remote sensing. Combined data are then used to build statistical models that describe the determinants of animal movement, such as environmental constraints (e.g. snow layer, habitat fragmentation, human disturbance) or the inner status of individuals (e.g. memory, orientation capacity). Movement is also the focus of a different field of research, i.e. human mobility, which is studied in a set of disciplines, from GIScience, to computer science, physics, geography and transportation science [4]. In analogy with movement ecology, human mobility benefited from the recent development of sensors capable of capturing human movement in real time and at detailed spatial and temporal scales (e.g. GPS trackers).},

abstract = {With the proliferation of low-cost sensors and the Internet of Things, the rate of producing data far exceeds the compute and storage capabilities of today’s infrastructure. Much of this data takes the form of time series, and in response, there has been increasing interest in the creation of time series archives in the past decade, along with the development and deployment of novel analysis methods to process the data. The general strategy has been to apply a plurality of similarity search mechanisms to various subsets and subsequences of time series data to identify repeated patterns and anomalies; however, the computational demands of these approaches renders them incompatible with today’s power-constrained embedded CPUs.To address this challenge, we present FA-LAMP, an FPGA-accelerated implementation of the Learned Approximate Matrix Profile (LAMP) algorithm, which predicts the correlation between streaming data sampled in real-time and a representative time series dataset used for training. FA-LAMP lends itself as a real-time solution for time series analysis problems such as classification. We present the implementation of FA-LAMP on both edge- and cloud-based prototypes. On the edge devices, FA-LAMP integrates accelerated computation as close as possible to IoT sensors, thereby eliminating the need to transmit and store data in the cloud for posterior analysis. On the cloud-based accelerators, FA-LAMP can execute multiple LAMP models on the same board, allowing simultaneous processing of incoming data from multiple data sources across a network.LAMP employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for prediction. This work investigates the challenges and limitations of deploying CNNs on FPGAs using the Xilinx Deep Learning Processor Unit (DPU) and the Vitis AI development environment. We expose several technical limitations of the DPU, while providing a mechanism to overcome them by attaching custom IP block accelerators to the architecture. We evaluate FA-LAMP using a low-cost Xilinx Ultra96-V2 FPGA as well as a cloud-based Xilinx Alveo U280 accelerator card and measure their performance against a prototypical LAMP deployment running on a Raspberry Pi 3, an Edge TPU, a GPU, a desktop CPU, and a server-class CPU. In the edge scenario, the Ultra96-V2 FPGA improved performance and energy consumption compared to the Raspberry Pi; in the cloud scenario, the server CPU and GPU outperformed the Alveo U280 accelerator card, while the desktop CPU achieved comparable performance; however, the Alveo card offered an order of magnitude lower energy consumption compared to the other four platforms. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/aminiok1/lamp-alveo.},

abstract = {Wearable devices are becoming popular for health and activity monitoring. The machine learning (ML) models for these applications are trained by collecting data in a laboratory with precise control of experimental settings. However, during real-world deployment/usage, the experimental settings (e.g., sensor position or sampling rate) may deviate from those used during training. This discrepancy can degrade the accuracy and effectiveness of the health monitoring applications. Therefore, there is a great need to develop reliable ML approaches that provide high accuracy for real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical optimization approach referred as StatOpt that automatically accounts for the real-world disturbances in sensing data to improve the reliability of ML models for wearable devices. We theoretically derive the upper bounds on sensor data disturbance for StatOpt to produce a ML model with reliability certificates. We validate StatOpt on two publicly available datasets for human activity recognition. Our results show that compared to standard ML algorithms, the reliable ML classifiers enabled by the StatOpt approach improve the accuracy up to 50\% in real-world settings with zero overhead, while baseline approaches incur significant overhead and fail to achieve comparable accuracy.},

abstract = {Printed electronics allow for ultra-low-cost circuit fabrication with unique properties such as flexibility, non-toxicity, and stretchability. Because of these advanced properties, there is a growing interest in adapting printed electronics for emerging areas such as fast-moving consumer goods and wearable technologies. In such domains, analog signal processing in or near the sensor is favorable. Printed neuromorphic circuits have been recently proposed as a solution to perform such analog processing natively. Additionally, their learning-based design process allows high efficiency of their optimization and enables them to mitigate the high process variations associated with low-cost printed processes. In this work, we address the aging of the printed components. This effect can significantly degrade the accuracy of printed neuromorphic circuits over time. For this, we develop a stochastic aging-model to describe the behavior of aged printed resistors and modify the training objective by considering the expected loss over the lifetime of the device. This approach ensures to provide acceptable accuracy over the device lifetime. Our experiments show that an overall 35.8\% improvement in terms of expected accuracy over the device lifetime can be achieved using the proposed learning approach.},

abstract = {Abstract—Nowadays, women face imminent risk of sexual harassment, rape and molestation in the streets as male predators roam around in search of their potential targets. In this precarious scenario, women needs to be protected in the street for their safety. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a wearable device that will protect and enhance the safety of women. This goal is achieved by analyzing the user’s pulse rate and oxygen measurements and updating them on the Blynk IoT web server. The user’s pulse-rate and blood oxygen saturation is determined by acquiring raw heart-rate and oxygen values from a pulse oximeter and oxygen sensor installed at the heart of the device. Real-time monitoring of user data is achieved by transferring sensor data to the Blynk IoT web server. This wireless device is specifically programmed to continuously monitor the user’s pulse-rate and oxygen values and react in case of a danger situation. It does so by detecting the abnormal pulse-rate and oxygen values, after which it sends the alert text message along with the location and live video streaming to the guardian’s mobile device via the Tasker app. Meanwhile, the alarm starts ringing. Besides, we validate our system architecture using different real time test cases. Moreover, we present a comparison of our proposed architecture with existing literature’s.},

Taking Tibetan horse racing in the biogroup as an example, it is essential to propose a virtual simulation method of Tibetan horse racing group based on the improved Boids model. On the basis of the SAC rules, obstacle avoidance rules are introduced, and the characteristic simulation of horse racing can be realized only by following the four movement rules of separation, alignment, cohesion, and obstacle avoidance, and each individual has ability to adjust its position and speed within the group according to its environment. In order to improve the fluency of system operation and optimize the scene model, a WebGL-based virtual roaming interactive system for Tibetan Horse Racing Festival was developed with Unity3D as a platform. Experimental results show that: Compared with traditional animation techniques and social force models, the algorithm can extremely improve the virtual simulation effect of horse racing group behavior, realize the real simulation of horse racing as well as improve the accuracy of biological group virtual simulation, which enhances user's real sense of reality and has practical significance for the spread and protection of Tibetan culture. In addition, it can be used for virtual racecourse, horse racing teaching demonstration, horse racing scene simulation, etc. In general, it has superior application value.},

abstract = {Mental health problems impact the quality of life of millions of people around the world. However, diagnosis of mental health disorders is a challenging problem that often relies on self-reporting by patients about their behavioral patterns and social interactions. Therefore, there is a need for new strategies for diagnosis and daily monitoring of mental health conditions. The recent introduction of body-area networks consisting of a plethora of accurate sensors embedded in smartwatches and smartphones and edge-compatible deep neural networks (DNNs) points toward a possible solution. Such wearable medical sensors (WMSs) enable continuous monitoring of physiological signals in a passive and non-invasive manner. However, disease diagnosis based on WMSs and DNNs, and their deployment on edge devices, such as smartphones, remains a challenging problem. These challenges stem from the difficulty of feature engineering and knowledge distillation from the raw sensor data, as well as the computational and memory constraints of battery-operated edge devices. To this end, we propose a framework called MHDeep that utilizes commercially available WMSs and efficient DNN models to diagnose three important mental health disorders: schizoaffective, major depressive, and bipolar. MHDeep uses eight different categories of data obtained from sensors integrated in a smartwatch and smartphone. These categories include various physiological signals and additional information on motion patterns and environmental variables related to the wearer. MHDeep eliminates the need for manual feature engineering by directly operating on the data streams obtained from participants. Because the amount of data is limited, MHDeep uses a synthetic data generation module to augment real data with synthetic data drawn from the same probability distribution. We use the synthetic dataset to pre-train the weights of the DNN models, thus imposing a prior on the weights. We use a grow-and-prune DNN synthesis approach to learn both architecture and weights during the training process. We use three different data partitions to evaluate the MHDeep models trained with data collected from 74 individuals. We conduct two types of evaluations: at the data instance level and at the patient level. MHDeep achieves an average test accuracy, across the three data partitions, of 90.4\%, 87.3\%, and 82.4\%, respectively, for classifications between healthy and schizoaffective disorder instances, healthy and major depressive disorder instances, and healthy and bipolar disorder instances. At the patient level, MHDeep DNN models achieve an accuracy of 100\%, 100\%, and 90.0\% for the three mental health disorders, respectively, based on inference that uses 40, 16, and 22 minutes of sensor data collection from each patient.},

abstract = {Falling is ranked highly among the threats in elderly healthcare, which promotes the development of automatic fall detection systems with extensive concern. With the fast development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), camera vision-based solutions have drawn much attention for single-frame prediction and video understanding on fall detection in the elderly by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and 3D-CNN, respectively. However, these methods hardly supervise the intermediate features with good accurate and efficient performance on edge devices, which makes the system difficult to be applied in practice. This work introduces a fast and lightweight video fall detection network based on a spatio-temporal joint-point model to overcome these hurdles. Instead of detecting fall motion by the traditional CNNs, we propose a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model based on time-series joint-point features extracted from a pose extractor. We also introduce the increasingly mature RGB-D camera and propose 3D pose estimation network to further improve the accuracy of the system. We propose to apply tensor train decomposition on the model to reduce storage and computational consumption so the deployment on edge devices can to realized. Experiments are conducted to verify the proposed framework. For fall detection task, the proposed video fall detection framework achieves a high sensitivity of 98.46\% on Multiple Cameras Fall, 100\% on UR Fall, and 98.01\% on NTU RGB-D 120. For pose estimation task, our 2D model attains 73.3 mAP in the COCO keypoint challenge, which outperforms the OpenPose by 8\%. Our 3D model attains 78.6\% mAP on NTU RGB-D dataset with 3.6\texttimes{} faster speed than OpenPose.},

abstract = {With the deepening of the aging society, the health care of the elderly and disabled people has been widely concerned by society. It is of great practical significance to monitor the physical conditions and abnormal behaviors of elderly and disabled people based on sensor devices to prevent diseases and dangerous behaviors. However, most of the current algorithms (classical machine learning algorithms, CNN, RNN, LSTM) are only limited to the traditional Euclidean space, with little expansion in Non-Euclidean space. The translation invariance limits the expression ability of spatial data. The signals collected by the wearable sensor based on human abnormal behavior recognition often come from different parts and different directions of the human body. The traditional Euclidean algorithm is used to solve the problem, which makes the classification results easy to ignore the spatial characteristics of the sensor signals. The emergence of graph neural networks provides a new method to solve this problem. A large number of studies have proved that the graph neural network has a great role in dealing with Non-Euclidean space problems. Therefore, this paper proposes a new method for abnormal behavior recognition of the elderly based on spatiotemporal feature fusion (SCGAT). The Non-Euclidean spatial features of sensor signals are extracted by graph attention neural network, and the classification model is constructed by combining the extracted time domain features of the time-series coding network. In the experimental results, the proposed method achieves better classification results than most of the current algorithms.},

abstract = {Sensing systems powered by energy harvesting have traditionally been designed to tolerate long periods without energy. As the Internet of Things (IoT) evolves toward a more transient and opportunistic execution paradigm, reducing energy storage costs will be key for its economic and ecologic viability. However, decreasing energy storage in harvesting systems introduces reliability issues. Transducers only produce intermittent energy at low voltage and current levels, making guaranteed task completion a challenge. Existing ad hoc methods overcome this by buffering enough energy either for single tasks, incurring large data-retention overheads, or for one full application cycle, requiring a large energy buffer. We present Julienning: an automated method for optimizing the total energy cost of batteryless applications. Using a custom specification model, developers can describe transient applications as a set of atomically executed kernels with explicit data dependencies. Our optimization flow can partition data- and energy-intensive applications into multiple execution cycles with bounded energy consumption. By leveraging interkernel data dependencies, these energy-bounded execution cycles minimize the number of system activations and nonvolatile data transfers, and thus the total energy overhead. We validate our methodology with two batteryless cameras running energy-intensive machine learning applications. Using a solar testbed, we replay real-world illuminance traces to experimentally demonstrate optimized batteryless execution with a transducer-to-application energy efficiency of 74.5\%. Partitioning results demonstrate that compared to ad hoc solutions, our method can reduce the required energy storage by over 94\% while only incurring a 0.12\% energy overhead.},

abstract = {With the promulgation of the Paris Peace Treaty, governments are paying more and more attention to environmental protection, and the world has put forward higher requirements for energy conservation. New energy becomes a focal spot, and more people are willing to invest in the new energy industry. Therefore, the question “which company is the worthiest to invest?” bother every investor. BYD, for example, has been China's new energy vehicle sales champion for four consecutive years. From January to October this year, the company's sales of new energy vehicles reached 172,000 units, increasing its market share to 20 percent and continuing to rank first. The Tesla Model 3, which is owned by Tesla Motors, has sold 158,925 units in the United States, occupying almost half of the sales of new energy vehicles in the United States. This paper takes Tesla as an example to study the influencing factors of new energy stocks, and this paper selects the closing price of Tesla from 2017 to the end of 2021. It studies the corresponding daily USD to RMB exchange rate, Dow Jones index, P/E ratio and CPI data for analysis, using S&amp;P linear regression. In conclusion, the stoke of Tesla is most sensitive to Dow Jones and least sensitive to exchange rate. New energy is an important area of future energy development in the world and the one with the greatest potential. The trend of new energy stocks reflects the stockholders' expectation and bullishness on the future prospect of new energy.},

abstract = {Indoor person re-identification (i.e., matching the same person across various locations) is important in making smart building applications more ubiquitous for future workspaces. Specific examples include occupant tracking, energy flow optimization, and security surveillance. Typical person re-identification (re-ID) systems rely on cameras to match the same person across different locations. While it is accurate, vision-based sensing requires direct line-of-sight and may raise privacy concerns. Besides, other sensing methods (e.g., wearables, pressure mats, RF/WiFi) are restricted to requirements such as carrying devices, dense deployment, and motion through wave path. In this paper, we develop Re-Vibe, the first system that re-identifies people through footstep-induced floor vibrations. Our approach is device-free, wide-ranged, and perceived as more privacy-friendly. The main challenge in developing this system is the discrepancy in structural properties and variations in footsteps at distinct locations, leading to different vibration feature patterns within the same person. As a result, it is difficult to match the same person's footsteps across various locations. To overcome this challenge, we model the structure and human influence on the vibration signals to develop a cross-structure transfer model that enables footstep matching despite the structure and human variations. The model is formulated based on optimal transport (OT), which compares the distribution pattern of a person's footstep features across multiple structures for person re-ID. We evaluate Re-Vibe at two locations in a building with wooden and concrete flooring. Re-Vibe achieved a 0.9 F-1 score with four people in person re-ID across these two locations.},

abstract = {mmWave signals form a critical component of 5G and next-generation wireless networks, which are also being increasingly considered for sensing the environment around us to enable ubiquitous IoT applications. In this context, this paper leverages the properties of mmWave signals for tracking 3D finger motion for interactive IoT applications. While conventional vision-based solutions break down under poor lighting, occlusions, and also suffer from privacy concerns, mmWave signals work under typical occlusions and non-line-of-sight conditions, while being privacy-preserving. In contrast to prior works on mmWave sensing that focus on predefined gesture classification, this work performs continuous 3D finger motion tracking. Towards this end, we first observe via simulations and experiments that the small size of fingers coupled with specular reflections do not yield stable mmWave reflections. However, we make an interesting observation that focusing on the forearm instead of the fingers can provide stable reflections for 3D finger motion tracking. Muscles that activate the fingers extend through the forearm, whose motion manifests as vibrations on the forearm. By analyzing the variation in phases of reflected mmWave signals from the forearm, this paper designs mm4Arm, a system that tracks 3D finger motion. Nontrivial challenges arise due to the high dimensional search space, complex vibration patterns, diversity across users, hardware noise, etc. mm4Arm exploits anatomical constraints in finger motions and fuses them with machine learning architectures based on encoder-decoder and ResNets in enabling accurate tracking. A systematic performance evaluation with 10 users demonstrates a median error of 5.73° (location error of 4.07 mm) with robustness to multipath and natural variation in hand position/orientation. The accuracy is also consistent under non-line-of-sight conditions and clothing that might occlude the forearm. mm4Arm runs on smartphones with a latency of 19ms and low energy overhead.},

abstract = {24/7 continuous recording of in-home daily trajectories is informative for health status assessment (e.g., monitoring Alzheimer's, dementia based on behavior patterns). Indoor device-free localization/tracking are ideal because no user efforts on wearing devices are needed. However, prior work mainly focused on improving the localization accuracy. They relied on well-calibrated sensor placements, which require hours of intensive manual setup and respective expertise, feasible only at small scale and by mostly researchers themselves. Scaling the deployments to tens or hundreds of real homes, however, would incur prohibitive manual efforts, and become infeasible for layman users. We present SCALING, a plug-and-play indoor trajectory monitoring system that layman users can easily set up by walking a one-minute loop trajectory after placing radar nodes on walls. It uses a self calibrating algorithm that estimates sensor locations through their distance measurements to the person walking the trajectory, a trivial effort without taxing layman users physically or cognitively. We evaluate SCALING via simulations and two testbeds (in lab and home configurations of sizes 3\texttimes{}6 sq m and 4.5\texttimes{}8.5 sq m). Experimental results demonstrate that SCALING outperformed the baseline using the approximate multidimensional scaling (MDS, the most relevant method in the context of self calibration) by 3.5 m/1.6 m in 80-percentile error of self calibration and tracking, respectively. Notably, only 1\% degradation in performance has been observed with SCALING compared to the classical multilateration with known sensor locations (anchors), which costs hours of intensive calibrating effort.},

abstract = {For a Chinook salmon restoration project in the lower Yuba River in California, we designed and deployed a wireless sensor network to monitor river temperatures at micro-habitat scales. The study required that temperatures be measured along a 3 km study reach, across the channel, and into off-channel areas. To capture diel and seasonal fluctuations, sensors were sampled quarter-hourly for the full duration of the six-month juvenile salmon winter residency. This sampling duration required that nodes minimize power-use. We adopted event-based software on MSP430 micro-controllers with 433 MHz radio and minimized the networking duty-cycle. To address link failures, we included network storage. As the network lacked real-time clocks, data were timestamped at the destination. This, coupled with the storage, yielded timestamp inaccuracies, which we re-aligned using a novel algorithm. We collected over six months of temperature data from 35 sensors across seven nodes. Of the packets collected, we identified 21\%  as being incorrectly timestamped and were able to re-align 41\% of these incorrectly timestamped packets. We collected temperature data through major floods, and the network uploaded data until the flood destroyed the sensors. The network met an important need in ecological sampling with ultra-low power (multi-year battery life) and low-throughput.},

In particular, mmWave radars are becoming the technology of choice in applications like contactless vital signs monitoring, people tracking, or activity recognition, when preserving the users privacy is a concern. However, single mmWave radar sensors have limited range (up to 6--8 m) and are affected by occlusions. For this reason, covering medium to large indoor spaces requires the deployment of multiple radar devices, i.e., radar networks. Because of the complexity of reflections produced by people moving in real life environments, the development and validation of algorithms for mmWave radar networks can only be fulfilled through extensive experimental campaigns. In this work, we present RadNet, the first experimental testbed for the easy deployment and testing of radar network algorithms. We describe its architecture and functioning and we show experimental results of a multi-radar people tracking algorithm implemented on the RadNet experimental platform.},

In this study, we explore the usage of LoRaWAN end nodes as traffic sensing sensors to offer a practical traffic management solution. The monitored Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) factor is reported and used in the gateways to assess the traffic of the environment. Our technique utilizes LoRaWAN as a long-range communication technology to provide a large-scale system. In this work, we present a method of using LoRaWAN devices to estimate traffic flows. LoRaWAN end devices then transmit their packets to different gateways. Their RSSI will be affected by the number of cars present on the roadway. We used SVM and clustering methods to classify the approximate number of cars present. This paper details our experiences with the design and real implementation of this system across an area that stretches for miles in urban scenarios. We continuously measured and reported RSSI at different gateways for weeks. Results have shown that if a LoRaWAN end node is placed in an optimal position, up to 96\% of correct environment traffic level detection can be obtained. Additionally, we share the lessons learned from such a deployment for traffic sensing.},

abstract = {Cloud computing has gained popularity and is increasingly used to process sensitive and valuable data. This development necessitates the protection of data from the cloud provider and results in a trend towards confidential computing. Hardware-based technologies by AMD, Intel and Arm address this and allow the protection of virtual machines and the data processed in them. Unfortunately, these hardware-based technologies do not offer a unified interface for necessary tasks like secure key generation and usage or secure storage of integrity measurements. Moreover, these technologies are oftentimes limited in functionality especially regarding remote attestation. On the other hand, a unified interface is widely used in the area of bare-metal systems to provide these functionalities: the Trusted Platform Module (TPM). In this paper, we present a concept for an architecture providing TPM functionalities for virtual machines in confidential computing environments. We name it Confidential Computing Trusted Platform Module, short CoCoTPM. Different from common approaches for virtual machines, host and hypervisor are not trusted and excluded from the trusted computing base. Our solution is compatible with existing mechanisms and tools utilizing TPMs and thus allows the protection of virtual machines in confidential computing environments without further adaptations of these mechanisms and tools. This includes storage of integrity measurements during a measured boot and for the integrity measurement architecture, full disk encryption bound to these measurements, usage of an openssl provider for TLS connections and remote attestation. We show how our concept can be applied to different hardware-specific technologies and implemented our concept for AMD SEV and SEV-SNP.},

abstract = {Nowadays, sepsis has been known as a serious health problem which becomes one of the major causes of mortality even in developed countries’ ICUs. The use of gene expression analysis and machine learning is an attractive and excellent solution to diagnose accurately the disease severity. Unfortunately, the collected dataset contains many genes among which highly correlated genes exist (redundant genes), which reduces the performance of diagnostics. Hence, efficient gene selection methods are necessary but challenging. In this paper, in order to verify the advantages of the machine learning technique and the gene expression analysis in pediatric sepsis classification, we evaluate and compare the performance of different gene selection methods combined with distinct machine learning models that are Filter, Wrapper, and Embedded approaches. In our work, a sequential gene selection procedure incorporates the differential gene expression analysis with the gene importance determined by the applied machine learning model to figure out the most informative differential gene expression. We also employ the cross-validation procedure in combination with different machine learning algorithms to verify the diagnosis performance. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the Embedded-based gene selection method incorporated with various machine learning models offers the highest diagnostic performance. In particular, the random forest-based gene selection algorithm combined with the SVM (Support Vector Machine) model that identifies a combination of 4 genes attains the best performance. The validation results have an accuracy of 89.6\%, a sensitivity of 41.5\%, and a specificity of 97.5\%, showing the applicability of this approach in the clinic environment.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the amount of data generated from Internet of Things (IoT) devices is increasing, paving the way for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) applications. However, with the traditional AI approach, users sharing their raw data causes many concerns in terms of privacy leakage. There have been reports that there are privacy violations on private data of users. In the medical field, the creation of devices to help automatically diagnose the user’s disease is gradually becoming a trend in the future. These devices help users monitor their own health, thereby reducing pressure on medical facilities that are often overloaded. However, the healthcare data of individuals will often be very sensitive and rarely shared by users. In addition, the profits generated from machine learning (ML) models mostly belong to the owners of that model. It also becomes an obstacle in encouraging users to share their data. In this article, we propose PriFL-Chain, a privacy-preservation framework to take advantage of data resources of data owners for training ML-based models, while ensuring the privacy of data owners. Specifically, we apply Differential privacy (DP) to federated learning (FL) to train ML models. Users just share the ML model trained on their data instead of sharing the raw data. Furthermore, the contribution activities of users in the system are recorded to the Blockchain to ensure transparency. We also leverage Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to reduce the pressure on the central server and reduce data communication costs, making the system more flexible. Experimental results have demonstrated that the combined strategy of FL, Blockchain, IPFS, and MEC can help reduce the cost of training ML models, effectively protect privacy, and utilize data sources of diversity from the community.},

We demonstrate MicroPress’ efficacy with two interactive scenarios that pose challenges for real-time input and we validate its design with a study involving eight participants.

In this work, we present a reinforcement learning framework that takes in sparse signals from an HMD and two controllers, and simulates plausible and physically valid full body motions. Using high quality full body motion as dense supervision during training, a simple policy network can learn to output appropriate torques for the character to balance, walk, and jog, while closely following the input signals. Our results demonstrate surprisingly similar leg motions to ground truth without any observations of the lower body, even when the input is only the 6D transformations of the HMD. We also show that a single policy can be robust to diverse locomotion styles, different body sizes, and novel environments.},

abstract = {While tremendous advances in visual and auditory realism have been made for virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR), introducing a plausible sense of physicality into the virtual world remains challenging. Closing the gap between real-world physicality and immersive virtual experience requires a closed interaction loop: applying user-exerted physical forces to the virtual environment and generating haptic sensations back to the users. However, existing VR/AR solutions either completely ignore the force inputs from the users or rely on obtrusive sensing devices that compromise user experience.By identifying users' muscle activation patterns while engaging in VR/AR, we design a learning-based neural interface for natural and intuitive force inputs. Specifically, we show that lightweight electromyography sensors, resting non-invasively on users' forearm skin, inform and establish a robust understanding of their complex hand activities. Fuelled by a neural-network-based model, our interface can decode finger-wise forces in real-time with 3.3\% mean error, and generalize to new users with little calibration. Through an interactive psychophysical study, we show that human perception of virtual objects' physical properties, such as stiffness, can be significantly enhanced by our interface. We further demonstrate that our interface enables ubiquitous control via finger tapping. Ultimately, we envision our findings to push forward research towards more realistic physicality in future VR/AR.},

A 77 GHz chirp-sequence radar is used to record Range-Doppler maps from object classes of car, bicyclist, pedestrian and empty street at different locations. Objective of this is to cover different levels of background noise in the data caused by the different environments due to trees or bushes. For the data acquisition, simple traffic scenarios have been simulated at Heilbronn University. In selecting a suitable ML algorithm for the classifier, the main challenge was that modern machine learning methods are data-based models which require a lot of data and are generally lacking in explainability, such as neural networks. However, the great advantage is that the correlations in the data are learned automatically. With knowledge-based methods, on the other hand, the big advantage is that they are explainable and require much less data, but assume an extensive domain knowledge. Hybrid learning, also called Informed ML, represents a combination of the methods previously mentioned and their advantages. In this paper, one approach from each of these methods is selected as well as trained, and its results are compared to each other. The respective approaches investigated are a deep neural network (DNN), a Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a hybrid model of a SVM and a specific neural network for feature extraction called Autoencoder (AE). In this comparison the SVM performs with prediction accuracies around 80\%. The hybrid model performs better achieving prediction accuracies around 90\%. The best results of this comparator are achieved by the DNN, which has a prediction accuracy of around 98\%.},

abstract = {Many characteristics are associated with the development of smart cities (SC), including the use of technologies to cope with complex problems related to the high levels of urbanization in the cities, such as guaranteeing better mobility, environment, and a better quality of life to citizens. In this sense, SC frameworks include, in general, governance and citizen participation as an essential dimension to assess the development of SC, based on the perspective that all stakeholders should share and contribute to solutions and visions for the future of the cities. Considering monitoring as a critical strategy to assess the advancement of SC initiatives, many measurement frameworks were created by different types of institutions and with diverse purposes. In this context, this paper aims to identify how SC measurement frameworks include indicators related to smart governance and citizen participation. Based on previous studies that systematized SC measurement frameworks and their main characteristics, this paper identified the presence of governance and citizen participation indicators, including the classification of approaches addressed by frameworks in this dimension. The methodology is based on desktop research and comparative analysis of SC measurement frameworks. Among the study results, the authors highlighted the lack of transparency of the indicators proposed in the analyzed measurement frameworks and the presence of different concepts and approaches to measure smart governance and citizen participation in SC initiatives.},

abstract = {Virtual environments are emerging as a tool for providing psychede-lic experiences due to the increasing interest in altered states of consciousness (ASCs) and the spread of VR headsets. However, the user experience of commercial psychedelic VR applications has not yet been adequately explored in HCI. To fill this gap, we conducted a user experience study of Cosmic Flow, one of the psychedelic VR available on Steam. In this exploratory study, six participants experienced Cosmic Flow and got interviewed. Analysis of user interviews revealed three main themes that articulate different aspects of the experience: moderate interaction, reflections on personal experience, and VR ergonomics. In the discussion, we derive seven design considerations to guide the development of psychedelic VR: non-active engagement, positive indolence and idleness, non-invasive multi-sensory modalities, creative and introspective activities, effects of priming, virtual nature, and comfortableness. The study contributes to design researchers and practitioners working on related experiences.},

abstract = {When collaborating face-to-face, people commonly use the surfaces and spaces around them to perform sensemaking tasks, such as spatially organising documents, notes or images. However, when people collaborate remotely using desktop interfaces they no longer feel like they are sharing the same space. This limitation may be overcome through collaboration in immersive environments, which simulate the physical in-person experience. In this paper, we report on a between-groups study comparing collaborations on image organisation tasks, in an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) environment to more conventional desktop conferencing. Collecting data from 40 subjects in groups of four, we measured task performance, user behaviours, collaboration engagement and awareness. Overall, the VR and desktop interface resulted in similar speed, accuracy and social presence rating, but we observed more conversations and interaction with objects, and more equal contributions to the interaction from participants within groups in VR. We also identified differences in coordination and collaborative awareness behaviours between VR and desktop platforms. We report on a set of systematic measures for assessing VR collaborative experience and a new analysis tool that we have developed to capture user behaviours in collaborative setting. Finally, we provide design considerations and directions for future work.},

Coupling the mobile device with Augmented Reality eyewear such as smartglasses can help address some of these challenges. In the specific context of digital content annotation tasks, this combination has the potential to enhance the user experience on two fronts. First, annotations can be offloaded into the air around the mobile device, freeing precious screen real-estate. Second, as smartglasses often come equipped with a variety of sensors including a camera, users can annotate documents with pictures or videos of their environment, captured on the spot, hands-free, and from the wearer's perspective. We present AnnotAR, a prototype that we use as a research probe to assess the viability of this approach to digital content annotation. We use AnnotAR to gather users' preliminary feedback in a laboratory setting, and to showcase how it could support real-world use cases.},

abstract = {Going wireless is one of the key industrial trends, which assists the emergence of new manufacturing and maintenance processes by reducing the complexity and cost of physical equipment. However, the adoption of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in production environments is limited due to the strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of industrial applications. In particular, Wireless Avionics Intra-Communication (WAIC) systems operating in 4.3 GHz band are designed for intra-aircraft use cases with considerable restrictions on the transmission power of sensors, which results in multi-hop topologies, complicating a guaranteed QoS. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has developed the protocol stack IPv6 over the Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode of IEEE 802.15.4 (6TiSCH) based on the IEEE 802.15.4 Standard for Low-Rate Wireless Networks, which combines the TSCH reliability with ubiquitous IPv6 connectivity and with the robust Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). The Scheduling Function (SF) is a core IPv6 over the TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4 (6TiSCH) component, but the specification of the SF is an open research topic: numerous scientific articles investigated how QoS for a wide range of applications can be met by developing specialized SFs. However, no full-scale information exchange between the layers of the 6TiSCH stack was considered to optimize the SFs and to improve the network performance. In this work, we propose a novel solution named 6TiSCH-CLX to satisfy demanding QoS requirements using cross-layer communication. It is an extension of the 6TiSCH framework at the network and Medium Access Control (MAC) layers, addressing latency and reliability challenges agnostic of the physical layer. 6TiSCH-CLX is evaluated both analytically and in simulations for several safety-critical avionic intra-communication use cases in WAIC. Preliminary results indicate considerable improvements to latency, while maintaining almost 100\% Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) without retransmissions and they highlight the capability of the cross-layer approach compared to existing solutions.},

abstract = {The rise of big data and smart sensing, with the promise of more educated and informed decisions, has fuelled a shift towards more data-driven decision-making in local and national government. However, we are observing a disconnect between the people who are affected by these decisions and their access to tools and resources to collect data in order to provide the needed evidence for change. To truly democratise this process and for citizens to become active prosumers of data, new mechanisms of citizen data production are needed. In this paper we report on a two-year ethnographic and iterative co-design process with the local community. This work encompassed the design, development and deployment of SenseMyStreet (SeMS), a bespoke sensor commissioning toolkit that enables citizens and community groups to use and commission a city's scientific-grade environmental monitors, determining where they will be located on their streets and collecting data to evidence hyper-local issues. Unlike prior research, which creates alternative data sources to contest city data, our toolkit helps integrate citizen commissioned data into the city datasets used by citizens and decision-makers. Reflecting on the design process and evaluating the ways people engaged with the digital tools of the toolkit, we highlight how commissioning can be configured to promote equity in the smart city, empower citizens to take ownership of issues and facilitate the creation of community networks that utilise the data for local benefit.},

Physical activity (PA) in individuals with SCI is positively associated with improved mental and physical health outcomes. Mobile technologies have been developed to motivate individuals with SCI to increase PA using activity tracking and real-time feedback. We conducted semi-structured interviews and participatory design sessions with 15 manual wheelchair users with SCI and eight of their family members/friends to investigate user impressions of future technologies that might use computer-mediated, sensor-triggered communication to motivate PA. We assessed barriers to PA and how context-aware communication could help overcome them. Participants with SCI expressed that PA tracking and communication technologies must be tailored to their specific needs. Further analysis revealed that context-aware messaging could help participants with SCI connect with others to initiate timely conversations about overcoming PA barriers, and to provide encouragement to meet their PA goals. We discuss opportunities to empower individuals with SCI with regards to PA using tailored, context-aware communication.},

abstract = {Smart voice assistants such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home are becoming increasingly pervasive in our everyday environments. Despite their benefits, their miniaturized and embedded cameras and microphones raise important privacy concerns related to surveillance and eavesdropping. Recent work on the privacy concerns of people in the vicinity of these devices has highlighted the need for 'tangible privacy', where control and feedback mechanisms can provide a more assured sense of whether the camera or microphone is 'on' or 'off'. However, current designs of these devices lack adequate mechanisms to provide such assurances. To address this gap in the design of smart voice assistants, especially in the case of disabling microphones, we evaluate several designs that incorporate (or not) tangible control and feedback mechanisms. By comparing people's perceptions of risk, trust, reliability, usability, and control for these designs in a between-subjects online experiment (N=261), we find that devices with tangible built-in physical controls are perceived as more trustworthy and usable than those with non-tangible mechanisms. Our findings present an approach for tangible, assured privacy especially in the context of embedded microphones.},

Despite this trend, the lack of support for autistic employees in workplaces complicates their employment. However, little is known about how people around autistic individuals can support them to create pleasant employment experiences. In this work, we develop the concept of the Workplace Playbook VR to investigate how virtual reality (VR) can help autistic people develop their work-related social communication skills in partnership with people in their support network. Using a video prototype to present the concept, we interviewed 28 participants, including 10 autistic people and 18 members of their support networks, which included family members and professionals. Our interviews revealed that the Workplace Playbook VR program can provide common ground for autistic people and members of their support network to participate in more empathetic communication regarding workplace challenges. Despite the benefits, we identified the potential misuse of social communication skills training features of the VR program to correct the personal characteristics of autistic individuals. Furthermore, to cultivate inclusive workplace environments, we found the needs of VR development not only for autistic people but also for neurotypical employees to promote their understanding of autism and empathy toward autistic employees. We suggest VR designs that promote a sense of agency and self-advocacy for autistic employees, and autism awareness and acceptance training for neurotypical employees.},

In this study, we explored this proposition through formative interviews followed by a design provocation centered around measuring burnout in a U.S. resident physician program. Residents and their supervising attending physicians were presented with medium-fidelity mockups of a dashboard providing behavioral data on residents' sleep, activity and time working; self-reported data on residents' levels of burnout; and a free text box where residents could further contextualize their well-being. Our findings uncover tensions around how best to measure workplace well-being, who within a workplace is accountable for worker stress, and how the introduction of such tools remakes the boundaries of appropriate information flows between worker and workplace. We conclude by charting future work confronting these tensions, to ensure personal sensing is leveraged to truly improve worker well-being.},

We consulted the HCI literature to corroborate our findings with studies and descriptions of existing cross-device transfer designs and to understand the potential impact of those designs on mixed-focus collaboration. We learned that as we move away from a restricted physical workspace and leverage the flexibility of digital personal devices, there is a large design space for realizing cross-device transfer.

abstract = {AI-based smart urban sensing (ASUS) has emerged as a scalable and pervasive application paradigm in smart city planning and management that aims to automatically assess the physical status of the urban environments by leveraging AI techniques and massive urban sensing data. In this paper, we focus on a crowd-driven neural network (NN) hyperparameter optimization problem in ASUS applications. Our goal is to utilize the human intelligence from crowdsourcing systems to identify the optimal NN hyperparameter configuration for an ASUS model. Our work is motivated by the observation that the hyperparameters of current ASUS models are often manually configured by the AI specialists, which is known to be both error-prone and suboptimal. Two key technical challenges exist in solving our problem: i) it is challenging to effectively translate the highly complex NN hyperparameter optimization problem in AI to a simplified problem that can be solved by crowd workers without extensive AI expertise; ii) it is difficult to identify the optimal hyperparameter configuration in the large hyperparameter search space given the blackbox nature of the AI model. To address the above challenges, we develop CrowdOptim, a crowd-AI collaborative learning framework that integrates the techniques from crowdsourcing, hyperparameter optimization, and estimation theory to address the crowd-driven NN hyperparameter optimization problem in ASUS applications. The evaluation results from two real-world ASUS applications (i.e., smart city infrastructure monitoring (SCIM) and urban environment cleanliness assessment (UECA)) show that CrowdOptim consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art deep convolutional networks, crowd-AI, and hyperparameter optimization baselines in achieving the ASUS application objectives under various evaluation scenarios.},

abstract = {Many academic works prove that Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) improves the quality of the application's production in software engineering. However, its adoption remains limited for several reasons: the complexity of the tools makes them less productive, the modeling languages and the mechanisms manipulating the models are hard to grasp. In that sense, low-code platforms are an interesting proposition. These low-code platforms, despite their simplicity of use, do not allow the design of large systems because of the opacity of the various artifacts (models, code, generation...). In our work, we want to improve the adoption of MDE models, tools, and mechanisms in application design process through a more simplified interaction. Rather than constraining the developer in a closed environment as it is the case with the Low-code platforms, we wish to allow him to have access, if he wishes, to models as well as the generation mechanisms of the application.We propose to build applications that are instrumented with modification actions on each element of their user interface. The applications are generated from models. A developer can modify or develop his application directly from the UI by calling upon the added modification actions. This makes his work easier by quickly locating (in the UI of the produced application) where to make the modifications and directly visualizing the result, rather than manually modifying each part of the model concerned. The instrumentation is based on a descriptive language for possible modification actions and a mechanism for injecting this language into the application generation chain. We have designed a demonstrator allowing us to conduct experiments, with various audience, in order to validate our work.},

However, complex state-based behavioral models still pose a challenge for students to understand and validate, mostly because of the intricate semantics of these models. We investigated this challenge and developed dedicated tool support in the form of a validation framework based on the YAKINDU Statechart Tools. Our validation framework simulates environments that interact with the code generated from statecharts as a means to animate various open-ended scenarios and predefined test cases that challenge the students' models. This enables short and user-friendly feedback cycles, which lowers the barrier for students to learn state-based behavioral models. We designed the validation framework to be extensible and made it available as an open source project together with two example environments and complete teaching materials. We report on our experiences in two undergraduate modeling courses (approx. 100 students each). Our results are promising in the sense that we detected positive effects of tool adoption and a surprising lack thereof, which we discuss w.r.t. lessons learned and future work.},

abstract = {Users increasingly rely on mobile apps for everyday tasks, including security- and privacy-sensitive tasks such as online banking, e-health, and e-government. Additionally, a wealth of sensors captures the movements and habits of the users for fitness tracking and convenience. Despite legal regulations imposing requirements and limits on the processing of privacy-sensitive data, users must still trust the app developers to apply suffcient protections. In this paper, we investigate the state of security in Android apps and how security-related code smells have evolved since the introduction of the Android operating system.    With an analysis of 300 apps per year over 12 years between 2010 and 2021 from the Google Play Store, we find that the number of code scanner findings per thousand lines of code decreases over time. Still, this development is offset by the increase in code size. Apps have more and more findings, suggesting that the overall security level decreases. This trend is driven by flaws in the use of cryptography, insecure compiler flags, insecure uses of WebView components, and insecure uses of language features such as reflection. Based on our data, we argue for stricter controls on apps before admission to the store.},

abstract = {Raw flash file systems are essential in today's cost-sensitive embedded systems and legacy embedded devices. The performance of raw flash file systems is often limited by their inefficient garbage collection (GC) due to the tight capacity of the onboard flash memory and CPU computing power. However, in real-world scenarios, we observed that the GC overhead can account for more than 85\% of the total I/O time, which not only degrades the performance of the file system but also shortens the endurance of the flash chip. However, existing GC optimization used in high-end SSD or server-side file systems usually leads to high CPU and memory usage, which is not suitable for the embedded environment. In this paper, we propose LightGC, a low-complexity and high-efficiency GC scheme. We design an optimized clustering algorithm for page hotness measurement and a hot-delay GC victim selection strategy. LightGC can also be adapted to locality changes in workloads to maximize the effect of cold and heat separation. Our experimental results show that LightGC offers a relative improvement of up to 19\% in GC efficiency, a 5\%-15\% reduction in write amplification, and a 10\%-17\% increase in flash memory endurance compared to other existing GC methods. In addition, driven by LightGC, we implement the UBIFS2 file system, an upgraded version of the UBIFS flash file system. We have done careful engineering design so that UBIFS2 and the original UBIFS are compatible with each other and users can switch between them freely.},

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) opens new perspectives for training machine learning models while keeping personal data on the users premises. Specifically, in FL, models are trained on the users' devices and only model updates (i.e., gradients) are sent to a central server for aggregation purposes. However, the long list of inference attacks that leak private data from gradients, published in the recent years, have emphasized the need of devising effective protection mechanisms to incentivize the adoption of FL at scale. While there exist solutions to mitigate these attacks on the server side, little has been done to protect users from attacks performed on the client side. In this context, the use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) on the client side are among the most proposing solutions. However, existing frameworks (e.g., DarkneTZ) require statically putting a large portion of the machine learning model into the TEE to effectively protect against complex attacks or a combination of attacks. We present GradSec, a solution that allows protecting in a TEE only sensitive layers of a machine learning model, either statically or dynamically, hence reducing both the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) size and the overall training time by up to 30\% and 56\%, respectively compared to state-of-the-art competitors.},

abstract = {Despite the recent exponential growth in cloud adoption, businesses that handle sensitive data (e.g., health and financial sectors) are hesitant to migrate their on-premises IT infrastructure to the public cloud due to the lack of trust on the cloud provider. Confidential computing aims to move the cloud provider out of the trusted computing base. New hardware features such as AMD's SEV-SNP can run a full virtual machine (VM) with confidentiality and integrity protection against the cloud. However, there exist challenges in supporting legacy operating systems and enforcing security policies (e.g., firewalls) in confidential VMs.In this paper, we present Hecate, an L1 hypervisor that runs inside a confidential VM enabled by SEV-SNP. Hecate can support legacy operating systems by running them in a nested VM and enforce various security policies on the nested VM based on the virtualization boundary. The key challenge in designing Hecate is that it cannot rely on the untrusted L0 hypervisor for nested virtualization. To solve it, we repurpose SEV-SNP's newly added privilege dimension called Virtual Machine Privilege Levels (VMPLs) to enable virtualization for a single nested VM.We have built a prototype of Hecate based on the Linux KVM virtualization stack. Our prototype is capable of running MS-DOS, FreeBSD and vanilla Linux without any modification. It also supports security checks on the nested VM such as network firewalls and kernel integrity. When compared with a regular, non-confidential VM, the nested VM enabled by Hecate can achieve a throughput between 57\% and 85\% for real-world applications such as the Nginx web server and the MySQL database.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) firmware upgrade has turned out to be a challenging task with respect to security. While Over-The-Air (OTA) software upgrade possibility is an essential feature to achieve security, it is also most sensitive to attacks and lots of different firmware upgrade attacks have been presented in the literature. Several security solutions exist to tackle these problems. We observe though that most prior art solutions are public key-based, they are not flexible with respect to firmware image distribution principles and it is challenging to make a design with good Denial-Of-Service (DoS) attacks resistance. Apart from often being rather resource demanding, a limitation with current public key-based solutions is that they are not quantum computer resistant. Hence, in this paper, we take a new look into the firmware upgrade problem and propose RoSym, a secure, firmware distribution principle agnostic, and DoS protected upgrade mechanism purely based on symmetric cryptography. We present an experimental evaluation on a real testbed environment for the scheme. The results show that the scheme is efficient in comparison to other state of the art solutions. We also make a formal security verification of RoSym showing that it is robust against different attacks.},

abstract = {Multimodal learning analytics can enrich interaction data with contextual information through mobile sensing. Information about, for example, the physical environment, movement, physiological signals, or smart wearable usage. Through the use of smart wearables, contextual information can thus be captured and made available again to students in further processing steps so that they can reflect and annotate it. This paper describes a software infrastructure and a study design that successfully captured contextual information utilizing mobile sensing using students’ smart wearables in distance learning. In the conducted study, data was collected from the smartphones of 76 students as they self-directedly participated in an online learning unit using a learning management system (LMS) over a two-week period. During the students’ active phases in the LMS, interaction data as well as state and trait measurements were collected by the LMS. Simultaneously, hardware sensor data, app usage data, interaction with notifications, and ecological momentary assessments (EMA) were automatically but transparently collected from the students’ smartphones. Finally, this paper describes some preliminary insights from the study process and their implications for further data processing.},

abstract = {Dynamic software diversification is an effective way to boost software security. Existing diversification-based approaches often target a single node environment and leverage in-process agents to diversify code and data, resulting in an unnecessary attack surface on a fixed software/hardware stack. This paper presents Rave, a practical system designed to enable out-of-bound program state shuffling on a moving target environment, avoiding any sensitive agent code invoked within the running target. Rave relies on a user-space page fault handling mechanism introduced in the latest Linux kernel and seamlessly integrates with CRIU, the battle-tested process migration tool for Linux.Rave consists of two components: librave, a library for static binary analysis and instrumentation, and CRIU-Rave, a runtime that dynamically updates program execution states (e.g., internal stack data layout and the machine node the program runs on). We built a prototype of Rave and evaluated it with four real-world server applications and 13 applications from the SPEC CPU 2017 and the SNU C version of NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB) benchmark suites. We demonstrated that Rave can continuously re-randomize the program state (e.g., internal stack layout, instruction sequences, and machine node to run on). The evaluation shows that Rave increases the internal program state entropy with an additional ≈200 ms time overhead for each re-randomization epoch on average.},
