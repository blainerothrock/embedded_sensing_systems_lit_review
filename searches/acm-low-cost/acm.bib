abstract = {Handwriting is a complex motor activity. Handwriting disorders, known as dysgraphia, have a considerable impact on an individual’s academic and professional success. To facilitate the diagnosis of dysgraphia, we propose an open-source and low-cost digital pen, called Sensitive Pen. In a first study, we evaluate its ease of use, usefulness and acceptability with psychomotor therapists. In a second study, we are testing the Sensitive Pen with children aged 6-10 to assess its ability to diagnose dysgraphia using machine learning. Our results show that psychomotor therapists would be ready and interested in using such a tool. Moreover, on a sample of 20 children, using the pen’s cinematic and angle data, we obtained a true positive rate, i.e. of dysgraphic children, of 100%, and an overall accuracy of 65%.},

abstract = {With global population growth, sustainable agriculture requires efficient soil moisture sensing for precise irrigation. While commercial soil moisture sensors are often limited by cost and durability, state-of-the-art RF-based sensing solutions require additional signal transmitter infrastructure, hindering widespread adoption. To fill this gap, we introduce GPSoil—a novel soil moisture sensing system that leverages pervasive Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals. On the hardware side, we employ two antennas along with a low-cost RF switch, enabling error mitigation for long propagation distances by comparing the signals captured from both antennas. On the software side, we leverage the inherent clock drift errors in commercial GNSS sensors and turn them into tools for fine-grained value extraction, enabling high-resolution sensing from otherwise coarse data. By integrating hardware and software innovations, we successfully achieve practical soil moisture sensing using GNSS signals. Built with off-the-shelf components, GPSoil achieves a soil moisture accuracy of 5.2% at a material cost of only $10.56, making it far more affordable than existing systems. GPSoil can sense moisture up to one meter underground, far surpassing other RF-based sensing systems and meeting the needs of most crops and irrigation systems. This work pioneers the use of GNSS signals in agriculture, offering a scalable, low-cost solution for advancing precision irrigation and promoting sustainable agriculture.},

abstract = {Sleep posture and movement reflect sleep quality and health. Polysomnography (PSG), the clinical standard, is costly and impractical for long-term home use due to its facility needs and contact-based sensors. Thermal infrared array (IRA) sensors offer a low-cost, privacy-preserving alternative, but their low resolution, blanket occlusion, and heat residual limit accuracy. SomnoSense, our non-contact, privacy-preserving sleep monitoring system, integrates IRA thermal data with low-cost direct time-of-flight (dToF) sensor depth data to form a 3D body profile. A lightweight fusion module, combining a random forest classifier and a state machine, addresses blanket occlusion and heat residual errors. Deep neural networks then enable posture recognition and motionlevel estimation. Evaluated on a dataset of 170 minutes of synchronized IRA and depth recordings from five subjects across six postures and three environments, SomnoSense achieves 98.7% detection accuracy, 96.1% posture recognition accuracy, and a mean absolute error value of 0.718 for standardized motion levels. A one-week, 45-hour case study further demonstrates its long-term monitoring capability, revealing distinct sleep posture and motion patterns. These results highlight SomnoSense's potential for practical sleep monitoring in real-world home environments.},

abstract = {Spike cameras provide ultra-high temporal sensing of scenes by recording photons’ arrival via binary spike streams. Reconstructing clear frames from spike streams is crucial for spike cameras, yet it remains challenging, with most existing methods requiring complex computations. To balance the reconstruction quality and computing cost, we propose an energy-efficient reconstruction network SIEST, which embeds a lightweight Q-K attention mechanism into a spiking neural network (SNN) architecture. SIEST utilizes the natural consistency between spike streams and SNNs. It processes spikes sequentially, propagates membrane potentials between timesteps for efficient inference. It preserves the low-energy-cost advantages of SNNs while enhancing long-range context modeling and maintaining fine spatial details. Experiments on synthetic SREDS dataset and real-captured spike data show that the SIEST delivers competitive reconstruction quality with a low energy consumption. These findings demonstrate that SIEST achieves a favorable balance between computational efficiency and reconstruction fidelity, making it a strong candidate for deployment on neuromorphic hardwares.},

abstract = {Since the passage of the Clean Air Act of 1970, overall air quality has improved across the United States. However, communities are still disproportionally affected by poor air quality and in some regions, a person's race and socioeconomic status can be correlated with the quality of air they breathe. Recent solutions have combined low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) platforms with low-cost sensors to provide real-time and historical data in communities that are affected by poor air quality. However, these solutions may not be sustainable as they can require new infrastructure and they may not meet the community's needs as poor air quality can affect individual community members differently. To address these issues, we partnered with several community organizations to not only utilize existing infrastructure to house low-cost sensors, but also to meet directly with community members to better understand the issues they face and to design interfaces and deploy sensors that meet their concerns and needs. From our findings and deployment, we found that overall, community members make daily decisions based on air quality and that they ultimately feel powerless. We also found that the sensors we designed and deployed captured higher spikes in air quality than what was reported by regulatory sensors and that community members near busy streets are exposed to higher pollution. While regulatory sensors serve an important role, our research shows that deploying fine-grained sensors can allow community members to have a better understanding of the air they breathe and our deployment provides a model for other communities to use to provide fine-grained air quality data to communities.},

abstract = {Consumer fitness wearables account for a growing body of personal mobile devices in the U.S. As a result, there has been increasing interest in Ubicomp in designing sensing devices which incorporate the needs of people of a broad range of backgrounds, especially of lower socioeconomic (SES) status. However, fitness trackers are expensive, and although low cost versions exist, there has not been much research on the viability of these devices for promoting their goals. To further the conversation of device use, we review a corpus of over 1,700 product reviews of 9 low cost consumer trackers, to determine perceptions and expectations of quality and general use. From this, we find that the low cost device is not currently necessarily increasing access, and that people have a wide range of expectations for what tracking will allow and represents at this price point, which colors how they describe their use experiences. We suggest that there is a need for a focused design effort for low cost devices which rectifies such discrepancies, and presents the low cost device as a counterpart to those of a higher consumer price, not an alternative.},

However, high-resolution thermal cameras are significantly more expensive than RGB cameras of comparable resolution, while low-cost thermal sensors generally produce low-resolution, noisy imagery, limiting interpretability for human operators and downstream machine learning tasks. We introduce the first framework for spatially and temporally consistent super-resolution RGB video generation from low-resolution thermal inputs, leveraging large diffusion models. Our pipeline operates in a fully tuning-free manner and is qualitatively evaluated across diverse animal species, datasets, thermal cameras, and resolutions, demonstrating strong generalization. The generated RGB outputs enhance scene interpretability while preserving temporal coherence, offering a practical tool for wildlife conservation, anti-poaching efforts, and behavioral analysis.},

abstract = {In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), embedded systems are massively spreading in critical infrastructures. Low-cost and low-power components are used to build such devices, which manipulate sensitive data and communicate at continuously growing throughput. To protect these data, IoT nodes embed cryptographic primitives including countermeasures against Side-Channel Attacks (SCA).In this article, we explore the interest of hardware-based shuffling to protect AES ciphers against power-based side-channel attacks in the context of low-cost IoT devices. Shuffling is performed via a dedicated hardware module, wherein a Pseudo-Random Number Generator provides a random vector used to control a permutation network, generating a permutation which determines the AES computation sequence. The approach has been explored and evaluated through several FPGA-based design solutions in term of area, timing performance, and security. Compared to an unprotected design, the best solution leads to a minimum area overhead factor of 1.2 or a maximum throughput of 45.23 Mbit/s. Furthermore, compared to existing works that also depend on hardware shuffling, the proposed solution is up to 10.4 times faster. Results show that hardware-based shuffling solution as implemented increases the Measure-to-Disclosure metric by a factor greater than 10,000 when considering Correlation Power Analysis-based SCA.},

Passive standing participants viewed four simulations: radial flow, oscillatory head translation, and these with congruent or incongruent low-frequency GVS (0.4 Hz). Medial-lateral head movements were tracked via HMD sensors, and vection strength was rated post-condition. Both GVS conditions significantly increased entrained head sway and vection compared to visual stimulation alone. Linear mixed models confirmed that sway amplitude and spectral power at 0.4 Hz predicted vection, while fractal sway dynamics were unaffected. GVS thus reinforces visual-vestibular coherence, offering a low-cost, scalable alternative to motion platforms for enriching VR experiences.},

abstract = {Bluetooth audio, as a common application in our daily life, faces a major challenge due to its limited transmission range in meeting users' demands. Traditional solutions, such as using high-power Bluetooth transmitters, require hardware upgrades that are neither cost-effective nor energy-efficient. This work introduces WiLE-Audio, a novel approach that extends Low Energy Audio (LE Audio) coverage through physical-layer cross-technology communication (CTC) from WiFi to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). We first present a novel symbol mapping technique from WiFi DQPSK to BLE GFSK symbols, which enables all-channel and reliable CTC to support Bluetooth channel hopping. Then, to implement CTC to commodity WiFi Network Interface Card (NIC), we present a real-time reverse scrambling method that dynamically calculates the payload of WiFi packets at the NIC driver. Finally, to align with the strict time window requirements of the BLE receiver, we design a precise timing strategy and a priority scheduling mechanism at the WiFi transmitter, effectively mitigating timing offsets due to Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) and queue management. These systematic innovations allow WiLE-Audio to be easily implemented into existing commercial WiFi and BLE devices with only a simple software upgrade on the WiFi side. Furthermore, using existing WiFi infrastructures, WiLE-Audio enables the relaying of Bluetooth Low Energy Audio (LE-Audio) and the roaming of BLE receiver at any WiFi-covered location. We implement WiLE-Audio on commercial WiFi and BLE devices, and conduct extensive evaluations across various scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that WiLE-Audio extends the transmission distance of LE Audio by 2\texttimes{} in single-hop mode and at least 2.6\texttimes{} in two-hop roaming mode. This work provides a cost-effective and scalable solution for enhancing Bluetooth audio coverage, providing a promising prospect for whole-house or even whole-building LE Audio listening.},

By leveraging manufacturing variations in a device, one can generate unique signatures that can be used for authentication and generation of secret keys. However, PUF implementation can be costly, taking up FPGA resources and requiring long design times.

abstract = {LoRa holds significant promise for marine monitoring and communication due to its advantages of long range, low power consumption, and low cost. However, in marine environments, its communication performance is severely degraded by the strong absorption of electromagnetic waves by seawater. To enhance the reliability of communication under weak channels in the marine environment, this paper proposes FCLoRa, a LoRa receiver enhancement system for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) marine environments. FCLoRa adopts a dual-domain cooperative strategy between the transmitter and receiver. On the receiver side, it employs a multilevel accumulation scheme to detect packets by aggregating the energy of windowed symbol “fragments” and reconstructs complete signals by fusing weak, fragmented signals from multiple gateways. On the transmitter side, it builds a two-dimensional polarization fingerprint library based on antenna attitude sensing and dynamically adjusts the transmission direction to match the polarization characteristics of the base station, thereby minimizing signal loss. Experimental results show that FCLoRa achieves a packet detection rate of nearly 40% at an extremely low SNR of –35 dB, and improves the average SNR by 1.92 dB compared to conventional LoRa reception, demonstrating its practical value in extreme marine scenarios.},

Shifting inference to the cloud increases the attack surface, generally requiring that users trust cloud servers, and increases demands on wireless networks in deployment venues. Our goal is to determine the extreme to which edge video redaction efficiency can be taken, with a particular interest in enabling, for the first time, low-cost, real-time deployments with inexpensive commodity hardware. We present an efficient solution to the human detection (and redaction) problem based on singular value decomposition (SVD) background removal and describe a novel time-efficient and energy-efficient sensor-fusion algorithm that leverages human position information in real-world coordinates to enable real-time visual human detection and tracking at the edge. These ideas are evaluated using a prototype built from (resource-constrained) commodity hardware representative of commonly used low-cost IoT edge devices. The speed and accuracy of the system are evaluated via a deployment study, and it is compared with the most advanced relevant alternatives. The multi-modal system operates at a frame rate ranging from 20&nbsp;FPS to 60&nbsp;FPS, achieves a wIoU0.3 score (see Section&nbsp;5.4) ranging from 0.71 to 0.79, and successfully performs complete redaction of privacy-sensitive pixels with a success rate of 91%–99% in human head regions and 77%–91% in upper body regions, depending on the number of individuals present in the field of view. These results demonstrate that it is possible to achieve adequate efficiency to enable real-time redaction on inexpensive, commodity edge hardware.},

abstract = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) are a promising technology for creating smart radio environments by controlling wireless propagation. However, several factors hinder the integration of RIS technology into existing cellular networks, including the incompatibility of RIS control interfaces with 5G PHY/MAC procedures for synchronizing radio scheduling decisions and RIS operation, and the cost and energy limitations of passive RIS technology. This paper presents RISENSE, a system for practical RIS integration in cellular networks. First, we propose a novel, low-cost, and low-power RIS design capable of decoding control messages without complex baseband operations or additional RF chains, utilizing a power sensor and a network of microstrip lines and couplers. Second, we design an effective in-band wireless RIS control interface, compatible with 5G PHY/MAC procedures, that embeds amplitude-modulated (AM) RIS control commands directly into standard OFDM-modulated 5G data channels. Finally, we propose a low-overhead protocol that supports swift on-demand RIS re-configurability, making it adaptable to varying channel conditions and user mobility, while minimizing the wastage of 5G OFDM symbols. Our experiments validate the design of RISENSE and our evaluation shows that our system can re-configure a RIS at the same pace as users move, boosting 5G coverage where static or slow RIS controllers cannot.},

Our unique approach enables the connection of external, inexpensive, and low-power "add-on" sensors to the smartwatch, expanding its functionalities. These sensors cater to specialized user needs beyond those offered by pre-built sensor suites, at a fraction of the cost and power of traditional communication protocols, including Bluetooth Low Energy. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we conduct a series of exploratory and evaluative tests to characterize the ECG interface as a communication channel on commercial smartwatches. We design a simple transmission scheme using commodity components, demonstrating cost and power benefits. Further, we build and test a suite of add-on sensors, including UV light, body temperature, buttons, and breath alcohol, all of which achieved testing objectives at low material cost and power usage. This research paves the way for personalized and user-centric wearables by offering a cost-effective solution to expand their functionalities.},

abstract = {Childhood physical inactivity and obesity are growing concerns globally, including in rural South Africa, where children often lack access to safe play spaces and well-resourced Early Childhood Development (ECD) centers and face increasing screen time. These challenges limit opportunities for physical development in early childhood. To address this, we developed Move With Me, a wearable tangible user interface (TUI) in the form of a superhero cape that encourages physical activity as a probe for further investigation. While many commercial technologies that encourage movement exist, they are unsuitable to rural communities due to their high cost and reliance on stable internet and electricity infrastructure. In response to these challenges, we co-designed a more contextually relevant solution with rural South African mothers using the technology probe to support the ideation and co-design process. The final cape design integrates motion sensors, LED lights, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and a solar rechargeable battery pack, delivering real-time feedback without internet connectivity or stable electricity. A companion mobile app gamifies movement with culturally relevant animations to engage children. We found that co-design empowered mothers to tailor the technology to their context, suggesting affordable components and re-purposing existing smartphone features such as sound and animations instead of using costly electronics incorporated into the cape. Their contributions led to a low-cost, offline-capable, and personalized TUI. Our work demonstrates how wearable TUIs, developed through inclusive design, can support physical activity in resource-limited settings. We contribute practical insights for designing sustainable technologies for rural contexts, emphasizing affordability, low power consumption, offline functionality, and the value of embedding co-creation throughout the design process.},

abstract = {What limits most the use of low-cost underwater unmanned vehicles is the lack of affordable and low-power acoustic modems and positioning systems able to provide satisfactory performance, such as accurate distance measurement, a transmission range of at least several hundred meters, and a data rate of a few kilobits per second. In fact, although low-cost modems are now available in the market, they usually provide a data rate of only a few hundred bits per second and may not be able to adapt their communication parameters such as modulation and coding schemes nor perform complex tasks such as One-Way Travel-Time (OWTT) ranging or online data collection and processing from attached sensors. In contrast, the Subsea underwater acoustic software-defined Modem (SuM), recently developed by the University of Padova and SubSeaPulse SRL, is a low-cost platform composed of a newly developed Raspberry Pi HAT analog frontend, which brings underwater acoustic data transmission and positioning capabilities over the widely used Raspberry Pi platform, thus exploiting its great flexibility. In this paper we present its inaugural sea trial campaign in fresh and salt water, where its ranging and communication abilities have been significantly tested. Results prove that the developed system is mature enough to be used in sea trials and provides good performance up to a range of several hundred meters when equipped with low-cost transducers, and of a few kilometers when used with professional transducers.},

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath have been used as biomarkers for diabetes detection in non-invasive, Internet of Things (IoT)-based devices. Nevertheless, the cost, compactness, and mobility challenges of existing devices limit their general adoption. We present DiaBreath, a novel, affordable, non-invasive multi-sensor device for the early prediction of diabetes, solving these challenges. DiaBreath consists of a) a dataset of 552 patient breath samples, b) a stable machine-learning pipeline to predict diabetes based on feature engineering, c) a simple interface to generate pre-diagnostic reports, and d) an optimal six-VOC sensor combination that is chosen with an ablation study. DiaBreath exhibits superior predictive power, with an accuracy of 97.6%, to enable efficient and scalable early diagnosis in public health centers, especially in resource-constrained settings. DiaBreath’s low cost and compact size make it highly adaptable for implementation in rural and underserved regions, where access to timely diabetes screening is limited. This technology improves non-invasive diabetes monitoring, making early diagnosis more cost-effective and accessible globally.},

abstract = {The global aging population is driving the need for solutions that promote healthy, active, and independent living. Current health monitoring solutions face challenges concerning acceptance and adoption due to perceived intrusiveness. This can be mitigated by using low-intrusive sensors integrated into indoor environments, such as homes, where older adults can spend most of their time and tend to be less active. However, continuous monitoring at home can generate large amounts of data. Local processing and storage are fast but costly, while cloud computing is cost-effective but may cause unacceptable delays. The advancement of 5G technology offers improvements in high-speed, low-latency data transmission, even in remote areas, allowing for better leverage of cloud resources. In the context of the “IMAGINE-B5G” European project, we envision a 5G-connected smart home that allows low-intrusive monitoring of older people living alone. In this contribution, we propose a radar-based activity monitoring solution for a 5G-connected home and present its first implementation and initial results on latency and jitter. The proposed home and monitoring solution have the potential to encourage people, especially older individuals, to be more active and/or facilitating early interventions for individuals with declining mobility, which would consequently help reduce the burden on healthcare systems.},

abstract = {Hearing loss is particularly harmful for language acquisition and neuro-development if it is left undetected in early childhood. Newborn hearing screening technologies using otoacoustic emissions (OAE) rely on detecting soft sounds generated by a healthy cochlea. High-income countries like the United States frequently implement hearing screening programs for every child at birth. However, such universal hearing screening is significantly less common in low- and middle-income countries, partly due to the conventional wisdom that the test requires sensitive and expensive acoustic hardware that costs thousands of dollars.In our MobiSys paper[1], we present the first wireless earbud design for low-cost hearing screening. Our hardware-software system reliably performs hearing screening using low-cost acoustic hardware, while being in the form-factor of a wireless earbud (Figure. 1a,b). The earbud hardware is designed to work across a large age range from newborns to adults. By developing low-cost and open-source wearable technology, our work may help address global health inequities in hearing screening by democratizing these medical devices.},

abstract = {In the past, underwater acoustic modems were mainly used in Oil &amp; Gas and military scenarios, that need long range transmissions with high power emitters often deployed in deep water. For this reason, the development of low-cost acoustic modems was limited to academic activities and experimentation. Recently, the new developments of low-cost unmanned vehicles suitable for shallow-water shore and coastal missions, and the need for sensors networks for measuring water quality and studying the effect of climate change in littoral areas, highlighted the need for low-cost and low-power acoustic modems. These communication systems can enable a wide set of applications, often based on low-cost underwater and surface unmanned vehicle swarm formations, where an acoustic link between the vessels is required to coordinate the mission and maintain the formation. In fact, these low-cost modems can be used for small-scale applications thanks to their low price at the cost of a low transmission range and throughput, when compared with the performance achievable with legacy acoustic modems. In this paper, we review the recent developments of low-cost and low-power acoustic communication, identifying advantages and limitations of these devices, and describe potential new applications that can be enabled by these systems.},

abstract = {Facial landmarks provide essential representations of facial states and movements, serving as the foundation for numerous face-related tasks. However, traditional optical device-based facial landmark detection (FLD) solutions suffer from limitations in low-light conditions, occlusion sensitivity, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose an efficient two-stage facial landmark detection system, CF-FLD, which utilizes millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar signals to reconstruct human faces. Specifically, CF-FLD is composed of coarse-grained affine transformation (CAT) and fine-grained offset transformation (FOT). To characterize large-scale and rigid facial movements caused by head poses and joint motions, CAT defines sparse and representative triangle constraints within and across different facial parts for affine transformation. Based on CAT results, FOT is presented to progressively obtain offset shifts from subtle and non-rigid facial deformations. Instead of resource-intensive area detection or search, FOT designs a multi-level region partition strategy, in which region-wise hybrid network and region-aware attention are constructed to hierarchically refine facial landmarks. Comprehensive evaluations on data collected from 20 participants in real-world environments demonstrate that CF-FLD can accurately localize facial landmarks during facial motion, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.02 mm and a normalized mean error (NME) of 3.37% at a low cost.},

abstract = {Deploying low-cost sensors to collect large-scale regional data is necessary in numerous applications such as environmental monitoring. However, the manual collection of sensor data is cost-ineffective. With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technologies, the collection of sensor data by UAVs has emerged as a promising approach. Therefore, it is often crucial to optimally deploy UAVs for efficient data collection to ensure low Age of Information (AoI) and low energy consumption. To describe data freshness and account for volume,, we propose a new data value measurement metric termed  ({rm{eAoI}}) , inspired by AoI. To consider both the data value and energy consumption, we further define a new concept: data value per energy unit. We consider the scenario where distributed sensors generate data continuously, while a set of UAVs are deployed for efficient data collection. We aim to maximize data collection efficiency, namely, the overall eAoI gain per energy unit cost throughout the collection operation lifecycle. We propose K-MADDPG, where all actors share a single Critic, enhanced with Kolmogorov–Arnold networks (KAN). The UAVs in the K-MADDPG framework had distributed decision-making capability, and could dynamically adjust their trajectory strategy according to the environment. Simulation results demonstrate that K-MADDPG exhibits significant improvement in terms of both convergence speed and performance.},

In this work, we present Xyloni, a very low-cost, low-power neural network accelerator for sensor nodes, which improves the cost-effectiveness and scalability of real-time wildfire detection by drastically reducing wireless data transmission and overall power consumption. Xyloni uses low-power flash and FeRAM memories to store a hardware co-optimized Neural Network model for fire and smoke detection, as well as intermediate activations during inference. It also time-shares a Field-Programmable Gate Array across different model layers for power-efficient computation. The detection model prevents benign images from consuming network traffic, allowing the use of low-bandwidth, low-power network fabrics such as a LoRa mesh network with enough range for the necessary geographical coverage. Compared to a wide range of edge and sensor platforms capable of real-time data collection, Xyloni demonstrated an order of magnitude reduction in power consumption for the network transmission reduction task, leading to a corresponding reduction in battery and deployment cost.},

abstract = {The rapid proliferation of generative AI has raised questions about the competitiveness of lower-parameter, locally tunable, open-weight models relative to high-parameter, API-guarded, closed-weight models in terms of performance, domain adaptation, cost, and generalization. Centering under-resourced yet risk-intolerant settings in government, research, and healthcare, we see for-profit closed-weight models as incompatible with requirements for transparency, privacy, adaptability, and standards of evidence. Yet the performance penalty in using open-weight models, especially in low-data and low-resource settings, is unclear. We assess the feasibility of using smaller, open-weight models to replace GPT-4-Turbo in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned regimes, assuming access to only a single, low-cost GPU. We assess value-sensitive issues around bias, privacy, and abstention on three additional tasks relevant to those topics. We find that with relatively low effort, very low absolute monetary cost, and relatively little data for fine-tuning, small open-weight models can achieve competitive performance in domain-adapted tasks without sacrificing generality. We then run experiments considering practical issues in bias, privacy, and hallucination risk, finding that open models offer several benefits over closed models. We intend this work as a case study in understanding the opportunity cost of reproducibility and transparency over for-profit state-of-the-art zero shot performance, finding this cost to be marginal under realistic settings.},

abstract = {The market demand for next-generation flexible electronics is experiencing a significant upsurge, particularly in cost-sensitive consumer applications like smart packaging and smart bandages. These products are beyond the reach of traditional silicon-based electronics due to their high production cost and rigid form factor. Printed electronics (PE), with its adaptable and ultra-low-cost solutions, essentially meet the unique needs of these emerging application areas. This work presents a novel approach using an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to design highly bespoke printed analog neuromorphic circuits (pNCs) offering robustness against variability inherent in the printing process. By leveraging this algorithm and designing robust activation circuits, not only the resistances (weights) in the crossbar and parameters in the activation circuits, but also the types of nonlinear circuits (i.e., functional forms of activation functions) as well as the circuit topologies (neural architecture) can be learned to enhance the circuit robustness against printing variations. Experiments on 13 benchmark datasets demonstrate that, compared to the baseline, the proposed methodology can further outperform the normalized classification error rate by ≈ 55.38% and ≈ 25.11% under high-precision (±5%) and low-precision (±10%) printing scenarios, respectively. Moreover, the algorithm suggests the ReLU as the most robust activation function (AF) circuit family with only ≈ 21% susceptible to low precision (±10%) printing variation.},

abstract = {Efficient and adaptive network topology design is fundamental in communication systems. A key problem is to construct low-cost structures like minimum spanning trees (MSTs) from uncertain and stochastic link measurements. However, topology and link data often reveal sensitive attributes, including location and traffic patterns, posing privacy risks. We propose Differentially Private Matroid Bandits, an online learning framework for consecutive MST construction with formal privacy guarantees. Modeling the problem as stochastic optimization over a matroid, we develop algorithms that balance exploration and exploitation while ensuring differential privacy in both central and local models. We establish regret upper bounds capturing the trade-offs among privacy, accuracy, and structural complexity. Experiments on real network data show our approach achieves near-optimal performance with strong privacy protection.},

abstract = {Mixed-Precision Quantization (MPQ) has become a key technique for deploying deep neural networks on resource-constrained IoT edge devices, enabling efficient TinyML applications while maintaining accuracy. However, current MPQ solutions face the following major limitations: insufficient flexibility in supporting diverse neural architectures and lack of energy-efficient hardware acceleration tailored for edge deployment. To address these challenges, we propose an integrated software-hardware co-design framework that optimizes Mixed-Precision Quantized Neural Networks for edge AI inference. Our framework introduces following key innovations: an adaptive reorderd pack scheme to improve data utilization, dynamic data flow schemes for low-bit-width computationally intensive operators, and customized SIMD (Single-Instruction, Multiple-Data) instruction extensions for RISC-V processors optimized for flexible mixed-precision computations. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves 1.23\texttimes{}-1.58\texttimes{} speedup for 2-8 bit operations compared to existing RISC-V implementations while maintaining excellent energy efficiency of 1204 GOPS/W. Our design also keeps the power range to 2.74mW, making it particularly suitable for cost-sensitive edge deployments. These advances provide a practical solution for next-generation IoT systems requiring adaptive precision and ultra-low-power execution on edge devices.},

Capitalizing on this, we present a battery-free wireless system for real-time pH monitoring in diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). Our core innovation lies in hardware co-design that implements on-tag RF computing. This is achieved by integrating pH-sensitive hydrogel as a functional antenna component to directly modulate backscattered signals. This enables direct chemical-to-RF transduction: pH shifts instantaneously modulate antenna impedance, thereby altering the phase of backscattered signals. To ensure robustness, we use a differential twin-tag architecture to suppress environmental interference, which enables precise pH extraction.

Transparent channels in 3D printed objects follow this theory, functioning similarly to optical fibers by transmitting input light. While prior work enabled basic interactions in custom optical sensors like push and display interactions using photopolymers, complex channeling remains challenging, particularly in desktop Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) due to the inherent printing discontinuities. We present a framework that enables low-cost desktop fabrication of optical interactive devices using Voronoi-based segmentation of objects for in-place FDM printing of optical channels. It allows uninterrupted light transmission where the embedded channels are aligned in the XY plane for uninterrupted printing. We further explore the use of FDM optical objects in routing and channeling strategies to support applications in displays, sensing, and embodied interactions.},

abstract = {Maintaining independence in daily activities and mobility is critical for healthy aging. Older adults who are losing the ability to care for themselves or ambulate are at a high risk of adverse health outcomes and decreased quality of life. It is essential to monitor daily activities and mobility routinely and capture early decline before a clinical symptom arises. Existing solutions use self-reports, or technology-based solutions that depend on cameras or wearables to track daily activities; however, these solutions have different issues (e.g., bias, privacy, burden to carry/recharge them) and do not fit well for seniors. In this study, we discuss a non-invasive, and low-cost wireless sensing-based solution to track the daily activities of low-income older adults. The proposed sensing solution relies on a deep learning-based fine-grained analysis of ambient WiFi signals and it is non-invasive compared to video or wearable-based existing solutions. We deployed this system in real senior housing settings for a week and evaluated its performance. Our initial results show that we can detect a variety of daily activities of the participants with this low-cost system with an accuracy of up to 76.90%.},

Emphasizing affordability, sustainability, and energy efficiency, our approach replaces costly edge devices with low-cost MCUs. Our two-stage Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) achieves over 92% accuracy in detecting five static hand gestures. It reduces power consumption and computational resources by 99% compared to sate-of-the-art methods, requiring only 120 KB RAM and 367 KB FLASH, compatible with ESP32-CAM boards costing less than 6 USD. Operating at 1 frame per second (FPS), our implementation is practical for real-world applications. Additionally, we integrate our system into a custom PCB setup featuring an ESP32-CAM board, relay module, and 2.4-inch TFT Display, enabling real-time gesture recognition for appliance control and display annotation.

abstract = {This paper discusses the application of intelligent inspection technology in construction engineering, focusing on the limitations of traditional inspection methods and the advantages of intelligent inspection technology. Traditional inspection methods, such as visual inspection method, infrared thermal camera local scanning method and traditional non-destructive testing method, are low-cost and easy to implement, but there are problems such as low efficiency, high risk and incomplete coverage. With the development of intelligent construction technology, intelligent means such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) curtain wall inspection and CCTV pipeline endoscopic inspection have gradually become the core driving force to improve the efficiency and accuracy of engineering inspection. UAV curtain wall inspection realizes rapid and comprehensive inspection of ultra-high-rise building curtain wall by integrating high-definition camera, infrared thermal camera, LIDAR and other sensors, while CCTV pipeline endoscopic inspection can comprehensively observe the rupture, deformation, corrosion and other conditions of the pipeline, and realize the long-distance inspection and save the video. Through the actual case study, intelligent detection technology in terms of efficiency, cost, accuracy, safety are significantly better than the traditional manual detection. However, the large-scale application of intelligent inspection still faces challenges, such as the influence of drones by complex meteorological conditions, and the lack of adaptability of CCTV equipment in the environment of narrow bends. This paper aims to provide theoretical basis and practical reference for the digital transformation in the field of construction engineering inspection.},

abstract = {To deal with the problems like delayed monitoring, low regulation efficiency, and high wiring costs that exist in traditional strawberry cultivation, we came up with and put into practice an intelligent monitoring system which is based on Internet of Things (IoT) technology. This system has a four-layer architecture known as 'Perception-Processing-Network-Application'. The Perception Layer brings together various sensors. For instance, it has the DHT11 with a temperature/humidity accuracy of ±0.3°C/±2%RH, the MQ-812 for gas detection, and the BH1750 which has a light intensity resolution of 1 lx. These sensors are used to collect environmental data. The Processing Layer, with the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller at its core, makes use of a sliding average filtering algorithm to do the data preprocessing. The Network Layer takes advantage of the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module that has a power consumption of 0.8 W and the MQTT protocol to ensure reliable data transmission to the cloud. On the Application Layer, a visual management system and a mini-program have been developed on the OneNet platform. This allows for remote configuration, heatmap visualization, and growth trend prediction. The experimental results show that the system manages to keep the temperature/humidity monitoring errors within ±0.3°C/±2%RH, has a light intensity resolution of 1 lx, the overall power consumption is only 0.8 W, the data upload success rate reaches 97.2%, and the average network packet loss rate is 2.17%. The system works in a stable and reliable way. It is low in cost, has great real-time performance, ensures secure communication, and is easy to operate. In effect, it meets the requirements for precise strawberry cultivation well. This solution offers a scalable and cost-effective way of deployment. It can also be extended to other high-value crops and can be adjusted to work with NB-IoT/LoRa technology.},

abstract = {Understanding in real time how we move, operate, and interact within living and working spaces is crucial to applications in smart buildings, elder care, and the automation industry. Myriads of systems have used complex electronics to capture this information, yet they often rely on independent sensors or devices that require active power and circuitry, also raising privacy concerns when using cameras or microphones. These solutions are often difficult to setup, have incompatible ecosystems, and require extra cost when upgrading already existing devices. In this paper, we propose SoundOff, a system that deploys ultra-low-cost, easily manufacturable, passive-ultrasound-emitting tags in any indoor environment (i.e., door knobs, toilet lids, cabinets, faucets, and windows), where the movement of this furniture causes a unique ultrasonic emission identifiable by a wearable device worn by users. These tags generate ultrasound signals during everyday interaction, above the range of human hearing, making them non-intrusive and non-invasive. This electronics-free, zero-infrastructure solution provides a scalable way to instrument spaces. Through a series of performance evaluations, we show that the ultrasonic emissions generated by SoundOff with different geometrical designs are not only robust to various environmental noises but also easily distinguishable from each other. Through physics-based modeling, we demonstrate how to systematically generate thousands of designs with unique and easily distinguishable ultrasonic emissions, enabling a wide range of interactions that can be mapped to custom automation systurce the work, including a geometric modeling pipeline and fabrication guide that enables design exploration, as well as an easily modifiable recognition system, allowing SoundOff tags to be replicated and disseminated throughout any indoor environment.},

abstract = {Biodiversity conservation in fragmented and remote ecosystems often requires labour-intensive, time-consuming fieldwork, placing staff at risk and limiting the scope of long-term monitoring. To address these challenges in a sustainable, locally adaptable manner, we present BearWave, a novel, place-based HF communication framework attuned to local infrastructure constraints and designed to support low-power sensing networks under severe radio-frequency (RF) conditions. By leveraging Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS) propagation and the FT8 digital modulation technique, BearWave achieves reliable, bidirectional data transfer—even in dense tropical rainforest conditions—while keeping costs under £200 per node and enabling extended battery-powered operation. A case study in UK woodlands, chosen as an environmental analogue to Borneo’s rainforest, demonstrated BearWave’s robustness and adaptability: despite dense vegetation and non-line-of-sight paths, the system maintained over 90% message reliability at distances of up to 25 km using only 1 W of RF power. Notably, the strongest signal propagation and best reception rates occurred during nighttime, reflecting diurnal ionospheric variations. These empirical results confirm that BearWave outperforms conventional technologies such as LoRaWAN or satellite systems in harsh, attenuating environments, offering a scalable, energy-efficient approach that lowers both ecological footprints and staff labor risks. This research advances conservation-focused communication by providing a universal, scientifically validated framework capable of supporting long-term ecological monitoring, poacher detection, and improved animal welfare. Crucially, BearWave’s low-cost, low-impact design broadens access for under-resourced organisations and community-driven conservation programs, where local knowledge and stakeholder insights help shape technology decisions on the ground. By embracing a socio-technical innovation model, BearWave exemplifies how computing can be sustainably embedded in remote ecosystems worldwide.},

We explore the design space enabled by RadioGami, including sensing paper deformations like bending, tearing, and origami patterns (Miura, Kresling) at ranges up to 45.73 meters. RadioGami employs a novel ultra-low power (35μW) switching circuit with a tunnel diode for wireless functionality. These surfaces can sustainably operate by harvesting energy using tiny photodiodes. We demonstrate applications that monitor object status, track user interactions (rotation, sliding), and detect environmental changes. We characterize performance, sensitivity, range, and power consumption with deployment studies. RadioGami advances sustainable, tangible, and batteryless interfaces for embodied interaction.},

abstract = {Understanding how people navigate urban environments is central for designing intelligent transportation systems and adaptive interfaces, particularly in the context of Human Automated Vehicle (HAV) interaction. In this paper, we investigate whether Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) scanning on smartphones can detect a user’s mode of transport by passively sensing the presence of nearby devices. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on Global Positioning System (GPS) or motion sensors, our approach determines whether a user is traveling alone or in a shared space, such as a metro or bus, by analyzing the quantity and stability of nearby BLE signals. We developed a lightweight iOS app that logs BLE advertisements and trained a classifier to differentiate between cars, buses/trams, and metros. Our findings indicate that BLE patterns are typically consistent enough to support practical classification, demonstrating strong performance in detecting cars and other vehicles while providing valuable insights for shared transportation modes. The system avoids sensitive privacy permissions, and integrates into a user-friendly interface that provides feedback and allows for corrections. We explore how this approach can enhance passenger detection and contextual adaptation in automated vehicles. This includes adjusting interfaces, improving safety features, and facilitating adaptive behaviors. The findings reveal that although BLE-based sensing has limitations in precision, it provides a low-cost and privacy-aware alternative to traditional sensing strategies used in mobility applications.},

abstract = {Deep Learning (DL) components have been broadly applied in diverse applications. Similar to traditional software engineering, effective test case generation methods are needed by industry to enhance the quality and robustness of these DL components. To this end, we propose a novel automatic software testing technique,Fuzz-testing via Transferable Adversarial Examples (TAEFuzz), which aims to automatically assess and enhance the robustness of image-based DL systems based on test cases generated by transferable adversarial examples. TAEFuzz alleviates the over-fitting problem during optimized test case generation and prevents test cases from prematurely falling into local optima. In addition, TAEFuzz enhances the visual quality of test cases through constraining perturbations inserted into sensitive areas of the images. For a system with low robustness, TAEFuzz trains a low-cost denoising module to reduce the impact of perturbations in transferable adversarial examples on the system. Experimental results demonstrate that the test cases generated by TAEFuzz can discover up to 46.1% more errors in the targeted systems and ensure the visual quality of test cases. Compared to existing techniques, TAEFuzz also enhances the robustness of the target systems against transferable adversarial examples with the perturbation denoising module.},

abstract = {In this paper, we evaluate the potential of radio frequency data present in Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) wireless signals to complement and improve Human Activity Recognition (HAR). HAR is prevalent in several applications catering to health, fitness, and well-being, driving the demand for robust, low-cost and efficient sensing systems. We utilized on-body wireless sensors to leverage the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and inertial measurement unit (IMU) information to gain deeper insight into fine-grain relative positioning that reflects on hard-to-distinguish motion patterns. Our analysis shows detection accuracy of 91.91% with IMU only for up to 13 different health and fitness activities, which can be improved up to 94.54% when combining RF data with the IMU data. The data was collected with 42 participants wearing 5 wireless sensors.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a novel mobile sensing application - life journaling - designed to generate semantic descriptions of users' daily lives. We present AutoLife, an automatic life journaling system based on commercial smartphones. AutoLife only inputs low-cost sensor data (without photos or audio) from smartphones and can automatically generate comprehensive life journals for users. To achieve this, we first derive time, motion, and location contexts from multimodal sensor data, and harness the zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), enriched with commonsense knowledge about human lives, to interpret diverse contexts and generate life journals. To manage the task complexity and long sensing duration, a multilayer framework is proposed, which decomposes tasks and seamlessly integrates LLMs with other techniques for life journaling. This study establishes a real-life dataset as a benchmark and extensive experiment results demonstrate that AutoLife produces accurate and reliable life journals. We also demonstrate the real-world application of AutoLife by integrating it into a digital journaling app that automatically generates journals for users.},

abstract = {While unencrypted information inspection in physical layer (e.g., open headers) can provide deep insights for optimizing wireless networks, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods heavily depend on full sampling rate (a.k.a Nyquist rate), and high-cost radios, due to terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks densely occupying multiple bands across large bandwidth (e.g., from 4G/5G at 0.4–7 GHz to LEO satellite at 4–40 GHz). To this end, we present SigChord, an efficient physical layer inspection system built on low-cost and sub-Nyquist sampling radios. We first design a deep and rule-based interleaving algorithm based on Transformer network to perform spectrum sensing and signal recovery under sub-Nyquist sampling rate, and second, cascade protocol identifier and decoder based on Transformer neural networks to help physical layer packets analysis. We implement SigChord using software-defined radio platforms, and extensively evaluate it on over-the-air terrestrial and non-terrestrial wireless signals. The experiments demonstrate that SigChord delivers over 99% accuracy in detecting and decoding, while still decreasing 34% sampling rate, compared with the SOTA approaches.},

To improve the perception and alarm ability of highway under extreme disaster, a simple perception- rapid alarm system for bridge is proposed in this paper. The system consists of perception system and rapid alarm system. The perception system monitors the status of the bridge in real time through low-power sensors, and realizes automatic networking with intelligent gateway as the node. When the monitoring data exceeds the threshold, the sensor triggers high-frequency acquisition and uploads the data to the cloud through the intelligent gateway. After the algorithm in the intelligent gateway or the cloud manager determines that the alarm is correct, the on-site alarm system is activated. Compared with the bridge health monitoring system, this system has the characteristics of "low cost, easy installation and high reliability". which enables overlay deployment of Bridges in risk areas.},

abstract = {The concept of ambient IoT was introduced by 3GPP to describe low-cost, self-powered, or battery-free sensor nodes, which may reach up to 10 trillion units in the future. By replacing chemical batteries in many standalone IoT devices, we can achieve ubiquitous connectivity through environmentally friendly and maintenance-free solutions. This paper presents a systematic design of an attendance tracking system utilizing battery-free photovoltaic (PV) Bluetooth beacon badges, along with several stationary gateways. In particular, the experiences with real-world massive deployments of these battery-free Bluetooth badges are emphasized. Thanks to a customized power management design that experiences only nano-watt power leakage before activation, these beacon badges can operate in low-light environments by gradually accumulating energy from indoor lighting, functioning in conditions as low as 17 Lux. The design prioritizes cost-effectiveness, making these badges suitable for potential commercialization, with each compact badge measuring only 40 \texttimes{} 30 \texttimes{} 4 mm3 and a bill of materials (BOM) costing less than $1. In field tests, every attendee at an academic conference wore a souvenir battery-free PV badge, which broadcasted a packet once sufficient power was accumulated. Stationary gateways installed in various conference rooms collected attendance information, while a cloud-based program was developed to visualize the results.},

abstract = {Accurate measurements of soil macronutrients (i.e., nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) and moisture play a key role in smart agriculture. However, existing commodity soil sensors are often expensive and the achieved accuracy is unsatisfactory. To address these issues, we present SoilCares, a low-cost soil sensing system enabling accurate and simultaneous monitoring of the concentration levels of soil moisture and macronutrients. SoilCares overcomes key challenges of accommodating diverse soil types and soil textures by introducing a novel membrane-based scheme. For moisture sensing, SoilCares leverages the multi-modal fusion of RF and NIR signals to significantly increase the sensing accuracy. Through delicate hardware design, we enable negligible-cost sensor data transmission using the existing sensing hardware, building up a complete end-to-end soil sensing system. SoilCares is cost-effective ($63.5), portable (0.5 kg), and low-power (236 μW), making it suitable for insitu deployment. On-site experimental results show that SoilCares achieves high macronutrient sensing accuracy with a low RMSE of 0.138, and extremely low moisture estimation error of 1%, outperforming the state-of-the-art research and expensive commodity moisture sensors on the market.},

abstract = {The large-scale deployment of low-cost air quality sensors is hindered by the need for site-specific calibration against reference-grade monitoring stations. This study addresses that challenge by exploring spatially generalizable calibration methods, leveraging a multi-national dataset of 34 sensors deployed across 10 urban locations in 6 different countries. We systematically evaluate three machine learning models, LightGBM, LSTM, and Transformer, under three calibration strategies: traditional individual dataset baselines, multi-location generalization, and a novel Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based spatial similarity method specifically designed for air quality applications.Our findings show that LightGBM, when combined with PCA-based spatial selection, delivers the best cross-location performance, achieving a mean absolute error of 6.26 μg/m3. This demonstrates that selecting calibration data from environmentally similar urban contexts significantly enhances model transferability across regions. Furthermore, our analysis of varying amounts of local training data indicates that new sensor deployments can achieve effective calibration without requiring prolonged site-specific data collection. This finding supports the development of scalable, AI-driven urban air quality monitoring systems with reduced setup time and lower deployment barriers.},

They offer a unique opportunity for contextual control of multiple different devices in a smart home using guessable and favorite gestures. Currently available gesture vocabularies are survey-based and sensor-agnostic, but still require experimental validation. Therefore, we present experimentally generated and validated original gesture vocabularies using two user elicitation methods, the guessability and production methods, for such sensors. The capabilities of the sensor was used to prime participants for design thinking to multi-control smart home devices. We provide guidelines for designing gesture vocabularies using the two elicitation methods and report on their similarities and differences. The methodological findings and experimentally validated gesture sets would inform HCI researchers in the design of user-elicited interactions for such versatile light or electromagnetic field sensors and similar gesture-driven applications.},

abstract = {Spectrum sensing plays a crucial role in spectrum monitoring and management. However, due to the expensive cost of high-speed ADCs, wideband spectrum sensing is a long-standing challenge. In this paper, we present how to transform Ultra-wideband (UWB) devices into a spectrum sensor which can provide wideband spectrum monitoring at a low cost. Compared with the expensive high-speed ADCs which cost at least hundreds of dollars, a UWB device is only several dollars. As the low-cost UWB technology is not originally designed for spectrum sensing, we address the inherent limitations of low-cost devices such as limited memory, low SPI speed and low accuracy, and show how to obtain spectrum occupancy information from the noisy and spurious UWB channel impulse response. In this paper, we present WISE, which not only can give accurate channel occupancy information, but also can precisely estimate the signal power and bandwidth. WISE can also detect fleeting radar signals. We implement WISE and perform extensive evaluations with both controlled experiments and field tests. Results show that WISE can sense up to 900MHz bandwidth with frequency range from 0.5GHz to 7GHz, and the power estimation error is less than 3dB. WISE can also accurately detect busy 5G channels and can classify the encrypted traffic from the channel usage patterns. We believe that WISE provides a new paradigm for low-cost wideband spectrum sensing, which is critical for large-scale fine-grained spectrum monitoring.},

abstract = {Rural Internet of Things (IoT) systems connect sensors and actuators in remote areas, serving crucial roles in agriculture and environmental monitoring. Given the absence of networking infrastructure for backhaul in these regions, satellite IoT techniques offer a cost-effective solution for connectivity. However, current satellite IoT architectures often struggle to deliver high performance due to temporal and spatial link challenges. This paper presents SateRIoT, a new network architecture with temporal link estimation and spatial link sharing that fully exploits the capability of space low-cost low-earth-orbit (LEO) IoT satellites and ground low-power wide area (LPWA) IoT techniques in rural areas. First, we introduce a bursty link model that predicts the number of transmittable packets within a transmission window, reducing energy waste from failed uplink transmissions. Moreover, we enhance the model by selecting informative features and optimizing the window length. Additionally, we develop a multi-hop flooding protocol that enables gateways to buffer and share data packets across the network while incorporating a priority data queue to avoid duplicate transmissions. We implement SateRIoT with commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) IoT satellite and LoRa radios, then evaluate its performance based on real deployment and real-world collected traces. The results show that SateRIoT can consume 3.3X less energy consumption for an individual gateway. Moreover, SateRIoT offers up to a 5.6X reduction in latency for a single packet and a 1.9X enhancement in throughput.},

abstract = {An emerging type of fraud involves malicious senders exploiting the blind shipment and cash-on-delivery (COD) mechanisms by dispatching large volumes of unsolicited, low-cost parcels. If unsuspecting receivers accept these parcels, they pay for both shipping and goods; otherwise, logistics providers bear the round-trip shipping costs. Existing detection techniques, which rely on extensive labeled cases, struggle with this emerging fraud because receivers' unawareness and low transaction values discourage complaints, resulting in few confirmed cases. Therefore, we propose leveraging receivers' complaints, though not initially collected for fraud detection, to uncover subtle indicators of fraud patterns, while addressing three challenges: (C1) noise-rich dialogues(C2) data privacy concerns, and (C3) ever-evolving fraud patterns. To address them, we design BLOFF, a Blind shipment detection Framework for LO gistics Fraud powered by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, BLOFF includes three components: i) Sensitivity Anonymization to protect sensitive user information; ii) Dialogue Profile Distillation to transform informal dialogues into structured representation, addressing C1, and distill knowledge from a teacher LLM (GPT-4o) to a lightweight student LLM (ChatGLM4-9B), addressing C2; ii) Multi-faceted Context Augmentation to enhance the interpretation of fraud signatures and adaptation of evolving patterns, addressing C3. We evaluate BLOFF on about 56,000 complaints records collected from JD Logistics between January and November 2024. Results show that BLOFF outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 10.19% improvement in precision. Furthermore, during its real-world deployment in December 2024, BLOFF identified over 90 fraudulent parcels with a 91.4% precision.},

However, it also comes with the risk of privacy breaches, where eavesdroppers can infer users' locations as well as activities by passively receiving and analyzing WiFi signals. In this paper, we propose ScatterShield to defend against wireless sensing eavesdropping attacks with low-cost backscatter tags. The main idea of ScatterShield is to interfere with the channel state information, thereby obfuscating the privacy-related features carried by CSI. We address the challenge of effectively interfering with unauthorized WiFi sensing with weak backscattered signals. We analyze the impact of backscattered signals on WiFi sensing and propose a method for interference with the cooperation of multiple tags. We design the interference strategies for tag operating, enabling ScatterShield to defend against various attack methods while retaining normal WiFi communication. We implement ScatterShield on our backscatter tags and evaluate its performance extensively. The result shows that ScatterShield can reduce the detection rate of state-of-the-art motion detection methods by more than 60%.},

abstract = {The traditional approach to programming embedded systems is monolithic: firmware on a microcontroller contains both application code and the drivers needed to communicate with sensors and actuators, using low-level protocols such as I2C, SPI, and RS232. In comparison, software development for the cloud has moved to a service-based development and operation paradigm: a service provides a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely by an application, or other service, but is independently managed and updated.We propose, design, implement, and evaluate a service-based approach to prototyping embedded systems called Jacdac. Jacdac defines a service specification language, designed especially for embedded systems, along with a host of specifications for a variety of sensors and actuators. With Jacdac, each sensor/actuator in a system is paired with a low-cost microcontroller that advertises the services that represent the functionality of the underlying hardware over an efficient and low-cost single-wire bus protocol. A separate microcontroller executes the user's application program, which is a client of the Jacdac services on the bus.Our evaluation shows that Jacdac supports a service-based abstraction for sensors/actuators at low cost and reasonable performance, with many benefits for prototyping: ease of use via the automated discovery of devices and their capabilities, substitution of same-service devices for each other, as well as high-level programming, monitoring, and debugging. We also report on the experience of bringing Jacdac to commercial availability via third-party manufacturers.},

abstract = {Imbuing sensing and interactivity into everyday objects has long been sought after within the HCI community to facilitate richer and more immersive user experiences. However, conventional methods rely on costly hardware, such as embedded sensor tags, or passive visual markers that lack digital capabilities to sense user context. We present LuxAct, an interaction-powered visual communication system that enables everyday objects to encode their information and user interaction data into sequences of RGB-colored light. These sequences are decoded by Point of View (POV) cameras on AR headsets or smart glasses to derive meaningful information from interactions. LuxAct mechanisms are self-powered and ultra-low-cost, leveraging striking and plucking on piezoelectric generators to harvest energy from user interactions. Through strategic pattern design, our system transforms visual channels into carriers of both object identification and sensory data, supporting applications with rich sensing needs. We demonstrate a wide range of use cases, including interactive controls, sensate storage, smart water hose, medicine reminders, fingertip probes and beyond, offering a practical alternative for digitizing passive objects to enable ubiquitous sensing in AR-enhanced environments.},

abstract = {We introduce Rhapso, a 3D printing system designed to embed a diverse range of continuous fiber materials within 3D objects during the printing process. This approach enables integrating properties like tensile strength, force storage and transmission, or aesthetic and tactile characteristics, directly into low-cost thermoplastic 3D prints. These functional objects can have intricate actuation, self-assembly, and sensing capabilities with little to no manual intervention. To achieve this, we modify a low-cost Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) 3D printer, adding a stepper motor-controlled fiber spool mechanism on a gear ring above the print bed. In addition to hardware, we provide parsing software for precise fiber placement, which generates G-code for printer operation. To illustrate the versatility of our system, we present applications that showcase its extensive design potential. Additionally, we offer comprehensive documentation and open designs, empowering others to replicate our system and explore its possibilities.},

Existing methods for wearable grip force measurement are cumbersome and user-dependent, making them insufficient for practical, continuous grip force measurement. We introduce EchoForce, a novel wristband using acoustic sensing for low-cost, non-contact measurement of grip force. EchoForce captures acoustic signals reflected from subtle skin deformations by flexor muscles on the forearm. In a user study with 11 participants, EchoForce achieved a fine-tuned user-dependent error rate of 9.08% and a user-independent error rate of 12.3% using a foundation model. Our system remained accurate between sessions, hand orientations, and users, overcoming a significant limitation of past force sensing systems. EchoForce makes continuous grip force measurement practical, providing an effective tool for health monitoring and novel interaction techniques.},

abstract = {Chronic respiratory conditions such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and asthma often progress insidiously, making early detection vital for effective intervention. Current gold-standard Pulmonary Function Testing (PFT) methods, such as spirometry, evaluate lung function by measuring airflow rates to detect potential obstructions. But, their cost, often several hundred dollars or more, limits their accessibility for regular at-home monitoring. In this paper, we present SpiroSense, a novel system that transforms a smartphone into a portable, low-cost, and accurate PFT device for everyday use by integrating a custom 3D-printed attachment costing just a dozen dollars. However, a critical limitation arises from the smartphone's inherent audio sampling rate (typically 48kHz), which constrains the airflow resolution to 11.9L/s when using conventional cross-correlation-based time delay estimation. This coarse resolution is insufficient to capture key pulmonary metrics, such as a Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) of 10 L/s, with high fidelity. To address this, we propose SonicFlow, which establishes a foundational airflow rate sensing model based on ultrasonic phase features and improves the airflow rate resolution to 0.148L/s. Furthermore, airflow-induced high-frequency harmonic noise within the 3D-printed model, combined with ambient environmental noise, further complicates accurate sensing. To mitigate this, we introduce NoiseClear, an end-to-end ultrasonic signal enhancement model designed to effectively suppress noise while preserving critical airflow velocity information. We prototype SpiroSense and evaluate its performance on a cohort of 59 participants, including 29 healthy individuals and 30 patients. Experimental results show that SpiroSense achieves average estimation error of 6.44% for Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), 7.42% for Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1), and 3.01% for the FEV1/FVC ratio.},

abstract = {This paper presents the design and implementation of TAPOR, a privacy-preserving, non-contact, and fully passive sensing system for accurate and robust 3D hand pose reconstruction for around-device interaction using a single low-cost thermal array sensor. Thermal sensing using inexpensive and miniature thermal arrays emerges with an excellent utility-privacy balance, offering an imaging resolution significantly lower than cameras but far superior to RF signals like radar or WiFi. The design of TAPOR, however, is challenging, mainly because the captured temperature maps are low-resolution and textureless. To overcome the challenges, we investigate thermo-depth and thermo-pose properties, proposing a novel physics-inspired neural network that learns effective 3D spatial representations of potential hand poses. We then formulate the 3D pose reconstruction problem as a distinct retrieval task, enabling accurate hand pose determination from the input temperature map. To deploy TAPOR on IoT devices, we introduce an effective heterogeneous knowledge distillation method, reducing computation by 377\texttimes{}. TAPOR is fully implemented and tested in real-world scenarios, showing remarkable performance, supported by four gesture control and finger tracking case studies. We envision TAPOR to be a ubiquitous interface for around-device control and have open-sourced it at https://github.com/aiot-lab/TAPOR.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) leveraging millimeter wave (mmWave) communication for bandwidth-demanding applications is considered in this article. Despite the large bandwidth, the delivery of delay-sensitive information collected by sensors may still face significant latency due to the vulnerability to intermittent link blockage. Hence, the guarantee of low age of information (AoI) in mmWave WSNs is not straightforward. In this article, the wireless sensing and dynamic programming techniques are jointly exploited to relieve the above issue. The former tracks the human blockers and predicts the chance of link blockage; the latter optimizes the transmission of multiple sensors based on the prediction. Particularly, the long-term optimization of sampling, uplink time and power allocation policies in a sensor network can be formulated as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) with discounted cost, where the state transition probabilities can be predicted via wireless sensing. A novel low-complexity solution framework, namely COSMO, with a guaranteed performance in the worst case, is proposed. Simulations show that compared with heuristic benchmarks, benefiting from the prediction of the link blockage, COSMO can significantly suppress the average system cost, which consists of both AoI and energy consumption.},

abstract = {Sequence ciphers algorithms encrypt or decrypt information at a low cost and high speed compared to other cryptographic algorithms, which are widely applied to critical applications and sensitive fields. As the core component of sequence ciphers, Boolean functions generate the random number or implement the update process of random numbers. The existing implementations of Boolean functions&nbsp;cause a great waste of area resources and generate several long critical paths that limit the hardware performance of sequence ciphers. To address this issue, a 64-bit Boolean Function Reconfigurable Operation&nbsp;Unit (BFROU) is proposed to reduce the area overhead, lower the delay latency, and enhance the operation efficacy of Boolean functions. Through statistical characterization analysis and cutting experiments of Boolean functions, a 64-bit BFROU based on Customized Reed–Muller 3 units has been designed, which has the advantage of being low cost and highly efficient. The Customized Reed-Muller (CRM) unit is customized based on RM logic. A theoretical framework for Boolean functions is proposed by combining CRM units with mathematical expressions, which encompasses Boolean functions for any variable. On the platform of synthesis software, based the theoretical architecture, a CRM-OPT optimization algorithm is proposed, which can achieve the conversion of And Inverter Graph (AIG) to Customized Reed-Muller Graph (CRMG). This CRM unit achieved at least 22.4% and 25.1% optimization in delay and area compared to Universal Reed--Muller (URM) units. The experimental results show that the Area Delay Product (ADP) is minimized when the CRM-3 unit is the optimal maximum cutting size. Ultimately, the BFROU design was realized utilizing CRM units, achieving an area of 195.4 μm² and a critical path delay of 0.35 ns. This BFROU can achieve special Boolean functions involving 64 variables at maximum, with 91% of these functions being mapped within two iterations. Moreover, this BFROU has significant advantages over other known schemes regarding area, critical path delay, ADP, and number of iterations consumed.},

abstract = {With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), substantial research efforts have been devoted to extending the sensing capability of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags. State-of-the-art approaches either demand sophisticated hardware redesign or are constrained to specific sensing capability, leading to increased costs and limited scalability. In this article, we present the design of a generic sensor tag (GS-Tag) based on RF switches and COTS RFID system for transmission of generic sensor data. RF switches are connected in parallel with the RFID chip, and the GS-Tag modulates the sensor data by controlling the RF switches. Specifically, with the RF switches turned on, the tag’s chip is short-circuited, rendering it unreadable; conversely, turning off the RF switches makes the tag readable. The reader demodulates the data through the compatible electronic product code (EPC) protocol. A subtle dual RF switch scheme is adopted to extend the communication range. In addition to the battery-powered solution, we integrate an RF energy-harvesting module, develop a high-efficiency energy management circuit, and design an efficient task scheduling strategy to enable the GS-Tag to operate in a battery-free mode. We implement a prototype of GS-Tag with COTS RFID devices. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our designed GS-Tag can achieve an average packet reception rate (PRR) exceeding 99%, exhibits robustness to environmental disturbance, and facilitates coexistence of six GS-Tags with an average PRR of over 91%. Due to the dual RF switch scheme, the communication range of GS-Tag extends to 12 m. Besides, GS-Tag has an extremely low power consumption of just 3.98 μW. A practical application is developed to accurately monitor temperature and ambient light intensity in an office environment while maintaining low power consumption. Our designed GS-Tag presents a cost-effective and compatible solution for expanding the sensing capabilities of COTS RFID system.},

abstract = {High-quality data are crucial for practical applications, but obtaining them through high-precision sensors comes at a high cost. To guarantee the trade-off between cost and precision, we may use multiple low-precision sensors to obtain the nearly accurate data fusion results at an affordable cost. The commonly used techniques, such as the Kalman filter and truth discovery methods, typically compute fusion values by combining all the observations according to predictions or sensor reliability. However, low-precision sensors can often cause outliers, and such methods combining all observations are susceptible to interference. To handle this problem, we select a single observation from multiple sensor readings as the fusion result for each timestamp. The selection strategy is guided by the maximum likelihood estimation, to determine the most probable changing trends of fusion results with adjacent timestamps. Our major contributions include (1) the problem formalization and NP-hardness analysis on finding the fusion result with the maximum likelihood w.r.t. local fusion models, (2) exact algorithms based on dynamic programming for tackling the problem, (3) efficient approximation methods with performance guarantees. Experiments on various real datasets and downstream applications demonstrate the superiority and practicality of our work in low-precision sensor data fusion.},

abstract = {Bursty, data-intensive serverless workloads, such as server-less big data analytics and DNN inference, amplify the fundamental tension for cloud providers between meeting strict tail-latency service-level objectives (SLOs) and maintaining cost-effectiveness. A key reason is that today's multi-tenant platforms cannot reallocate physical cores between hardware-isolated virtual machines (VMs) at the microsecond speeds these applications require. This capability is critical for instantly responding to demand spikes by shifting resources from low-priority to latency-sensitive tasks.This position paper introduces HyperFlux, a hyper-reactive virtualization stack comprising three co-designed components: a virtual machine monitor (VMM), a lightweight guest OS, and a Linux kernel module as its core arbiter. HyperFlux achieves core reallocation and vertical core scaling (up/down) among hardware-isolated VMs within tens of microseconds. By coupling transparent, fast vertical core scaling with microsecond-level core reallocation, HyperFlux advances hardware-isolated (KVM) serverless provisioning agility and resource elasticity to the microsecond scale. We discuss the system design and aim to stimulate discussion on next-generation, cloud-native computing with extreme agility.},

However, limitations of current tracking mechanisms - line-of-sight occlusion, drifting errors, small working volumes, or instrumentation that requires maintenance - ultimately restrict their adoption. This paper introduces MagDesk, an interactive tabletop workspace capable of real-time 3D tracking of passive magnets embedded in objects. Using a sensing array of 112 low-cost magnetometers underneath a table, our custom-designed signal processing and localization engine enables simultaneous tracking of multiple magnets in 5 degrees of freedom with millimeter accuracy. MagDesk can continuously and robustly track magnets at a maximum height of 600 mm over a 1750 mm (L) \texttimes{} 950 mm (W) table, while achieving an average positional and orientational error of 2.49 mm and 0.72 ° near the table surface and 14.40 mm and 2.25° across the entire sensing range. To demonstrate MagDesk's object-tracking capabilities, this work presents a series of magnetic widgets for tangible interactions and explores two applications - a 3D drawing interface and augmented-reality tabletop games. By instrumenting a regular table surface, MagDesk presents a low-cost and accurate approach to 3D tracking passive objects for home and office environments.},

abstract = {Anecdotal evidence indicates that the swift expansion of supply chains can give rise to significant adverse environmental consequences, primarily attributable to suppliers lacking adequate green capabilities. These repercussions are further compounded by the challenges faced by core enterprises in effectively managing and regulating the environmentally friendly practices of their suppliers. To mitigate this concern, two strategies are gradually adopted in business practice: supplier integration and supplier development. This paper investigates the effects of some critical contextual factors, e.g., the consumer green sensitivity coefficient, the cost parameter of developing green technologies, and the integration cost, on the selection of these two strategies. The results indicate: (I) low levels of consumers' green sensitivity coefficient prompt the manufacturer to integrate the supplier, while high levels of that lead the manufacturer to develop the supplier. (II) When the cost parameter of developing green technology is relatively low, the supplier development strategy is more beneficial to the manufacturer. Otherwise, when the cost parameter is high, the supplier integration strategy becomes more conducive. (III) Through comparative analysis, a threshold for integration cost has been determined. An integration cost below this threshold will lead the manufacturer to choose the supplier integration strategy. Our findings provide new insights into green supply chain literature and management implications for enterprises to formulate effective supplier relationship management strategies.},

While prior work has explored sparse cues such as magnetic anomalies or BLE beacons to correct the drift, there remains a need for dense and low-cost landmarks. We propose a novel acoustic-assisted PDR method that detects ubiquitous doors and walls via active sensing with standard smartphone speakers and microphones. Our system generates Range-Doppler maps from audio echoes and applies a lightweight Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN) to classify acoustic events and estimate wall distance. These cues are fused with inertial priors in a segmented particle-filter framework: door events serve as absolute anchors, and detected walls are used to fine-tune trajectory estimates. Evaluated across nine diverse indoor environments and four smartphone models without environment-specific training, our method reduces the mean absolute positioning error by 86.83% compared to state-of-the-art neural PDR and achieves sub-meter mean absolute error over more than 10,000 meters of walking.},

abstract = {Urban air pollution hotspots pose significant health risks, yet their detection and analysis remain limited by the sparsity of public sensor networks. This article addresses this challenge by combining predictive modeling and mechanistic approaches to comprehensively monitor pollution hotspots. We enhanced New Delhi’s existing sensor network with 28 low-cost sensors, collecting PM2.5 data over 30 months from May 1, 2018, to Nov 1, 2020. Applying established definitions of hotspots to this data, we found the existence of an additional 189 hidden monthly hotspots in addition to confirming the 660 detected by the public network. Using predictive techniques like Space-Time Kriging, we identified monthly hotspots with 95% precision and 88% recall with 50% sensor failure rate, and with 98% precision and 95% recall with 50% missing sensors. The projections of our predictive model were further compiled into policy recommendations for public authorities. Additionally, we developed a Gaussian Plume Dispersion Model to understand the mechanistic underpinnings of hotspot formation, incorporating an emissions inventory derived from local sources. Our mechanistic model is able to explain 65% of observed transient hotspots. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating data-driven predictive models with physics-based mechanistic models for scalable and robust air pollution management in resource-constrained settings.},

abstract = {Accurate measurement of ice thickness is essential for safety in ice-related human activities; however, existing solutions are often cumbersome or expensive. We present IceSound, a novel system that leverages the ubiquity of smartphones to realize portable, cost-effective, and real-time ice thickness sensing. IceSound tackles multiple challenges including overlapping echoes due to the higher sound speed in ice (approximately 3250 m/s), weak bottom reflections due to attenuation in thick ice, and variations of temperature and device orientation during measurements. Extensive field experiments show that IceSound achieves a mean absolute error of 0.3 cm for ice thickness measurement when the ice thickness is in the critical range of 10-15 cm. When assessing whether the ice thickness is safe for human activities based on the well-recognized 15 cm threshold, the system exhibits a remarkably low error rate of 0.13%, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing safety for ice-related human activities.},

abstract = {Smartwatches are equipped with fixed sensors (e.g., ECG, IMUs) or actuators designed for a broad audience. However, some users need specialized smartwatch functionality, creating a demand for add-on devices that extend a smartwatch’s capabilities. Our work explores the design of add-on devices that communicate with the smartwatch using visible light. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we conduct a series of characterization experiments to assess the ability of the smartwatch’s ambient light sensor and screen as a light-based receiver and transmitter, respectively, and develop strategies for establishing a reliable communication link. Our approach is low-cost, has minimal instrumentation of a smartwatch, and supports the addition of input and output capabilities. To validate our approach, we design and test a suite of add-ons that expand the sensing (e.g. buttons, body temperature, etc.) and output (visual feedback and haptic wristband) capabilities of the smartwatch. We also contribute a toolkit framework comprising our hardware designs and a software library that enables designers and developers to quickly create applications that integrate add-ons with smartwatches using our approach.},

Nowadays with advanced communications and a high degree of digitisation, smart cities can integrate AQ monitoring networks based on wireless Internet of Things (IoT) sensor nodes, which for large deployments are often built with low-cost and less accurate components. In this paper, we focus on the calibration process of ozone Low-Cost Sensors (LCS) in order to improve their accuracy by using machine learning ensemble techniques and reduce their error compared with official measurements of this parameter in a real deployment.

This paper evaluates the positioning accuracy of odometers constructed based on four principles: Time Differenced Carrier Phase (TDCP), Time Differenced Pesudorange (TDPR), Visual-Inertial Navigation System (VINS), and Inertial Navigation System (INS). Quantitative research was conducted using low-cost receiver Ublox ZED-F9P, inertial navigation instruments of different accuracy levels, and low-cost VINS equipment, combined with four open-source datasets. The results indicate that in terms of accuracy, TDCP technology has the slowest dead reckoning divergence speed, but is easily affected by the observation environment. In contrast, VINS has a slightly faster divergence speed, but its performance is affected by factors such as dynamic objects. Inertial navigation equipment is least affected by the environment, but even for navigation level equipment, pure inertial dead reckoning can diverge by tens of meters in position within 3 minutes.},

abstract = {Novel view synthesis (NVS) in low-light scenes remains a significant challenge due to degraded inputs characterized by severe noise, low dynamic range (LDR) and unreliable initialization. While recent NeRF-based approaches have shown promising results, most suffer from high computational costs, and some rely on carefully captured or pre-processed data-such as RAW sensor inputs or multi-exposure sequences-which severely limits their practicality. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with competitive visual fidelity; however, existing 3DGS-based methods struggle with low-light sRGB inputs, resulting in unstable Gaussian initialization and ineffective noise suppression. To address these challenges, we propose LL-Gaussian, a novel framework for 3D reconstruction and enhancement from low-light sRGB images, enabling pseudo normal-light novel view synthesis. Our method introduces three key innovations: 1) an end-to-end Low-Light Gaussian Initialization Module (LLGIM) that leverages dense priors from learning-based MVS approach to generate high-quality initial point clouds; 2) a dual-branch Gaussian decomposition model that disentangles intrinsic scene properties (reflectance and illumination) from transient interference, enabling stable and interpretable optimization; 3) an unsupervised optimization strategy guided by both physical constrains and diffusion prior to jointly steer decomposition and enhancement. Additionally, we contribute a challenging dataset collected in extreme low-light environments and demonstrate the effectiveness of LL-Gaussian. Compared to state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods, LL-Gaussian achieves up to 2,000\texttimes{} faster inference and reduces training time to just 2%, while delivering superior reconstruction and rendering quality.},

In this study, three aspects of human information estimation, motion gait generation, and trajectory tracking control are explored. Moreover, the recognition and control method proposed in this study only requires human lower limb position and motor encoder information, and does not rely on force sensors, which has a wide range of applications and low development cost, and can be widely used in multiple types of heterogeneous exoskeleton robots.},

abstract = {This study investigates smart eyewear for facial gesture classification with low user calibration costs. The smart eyewear is equipped with low-cost, comfortable, energy-efficient photo-reflective sensors, which can detect changes in facial muscle movements. Although the sensor output is useful for facial gesture classification, individual user calibration is considered necessary. Moreover, re-calibration is required whenever the user’s wearing position changes. Therefore, reducing the calibration cost is crucial for the wider applicability of the eyewear.To address this issue, we propose a few-shot domain adaptation approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We evaluate the accuracy of classifying eight gestures with data augmentation and a supervised contrastive loss. Data augmentation is employed to make the model more robust to noise, while the supervised contrastive loss is introduced to learn user-invariant features. Our approach with data augmentation achieves robust gesture classification, with an average accuracy of 93.46% (SD = 8.34%) for three emotion-related gestures without user-specific data. Furthermore, for user-independent training, we demonstrated that using few-shot learning with pre-trained models and only four repetitions of calibration data per gesture achieved a practical accuracy of 91.38% (SD = 6.03%), showing that a small amount of user-specific data is sufficient for the accurate classification. Also, it works under different wearing conditions, achieving an accuracy of 90.19% (SD = 3.56%). These results illustrate the potential of our method to improve the practicality of smart eyewear for facial expression recognition in cases of limited user data, making it more accessible and user-friendly.},

abstract = {In the field of facility agriculture, intelligent transformation has become a key path to address labor shortages, low resource utilization efficiency, and the need for precise environmental regulation. This study focuses on developing a low-cost and highly scalable tomato greenhouse intelligent control platform, dedicated to achieving multi-source data fusion processing and unmanned production mode. The platform architecture relies on IoT sensing technology to build a perception layer, which collects environmental parameters in real-time through various sensors deployed in the greenhouse, such as temperature, humidity, and light intensity, utilizing a cloud edge collaborative control mechanism to ensure efficient data processing and rapid response, achieving precise control of the greenhouse environment. In terms of decision support, the neural network algorithm is introduced to conduct in-depth analysis and decision-making on collected data, optimize resource allocation, and improve tomato yield and quality. This platform proposes a dynamic fusion model of multi-source data, which can integrate multiple pieces of information from different sensors and historical databases, providing a comprehensive basis for precise regulation. The platform adopts a modular and scalable architecture, which facilitates flexible expansion of functional modules or integration of new sensor devices according to actual production needs, ensuring the long-term applicability and maintainability of the system. A set of resource optimization control strategies has been developed to minimize energy consumption and resource waste while ensuring a suitable tomato growth environment, and to improve the economic benefits and sustainable development capabilities of facility agriculture. The research results provide effective technical solutions for the intelligent upgrading of facility agriculture, promoting the development of tomato production towards high efficiency, precision, and intelligence.},

abstract = {The network traffic data produced by the Internet of Things (IoT) devices are collected by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and IoT manufacturers, and often also shared with their third parties to maintain and enhance user experiences. Unfortunately, on-path adversaries could fingerprint users’ sensitive and private information by analyzing these network traffic traces. While there’s a growing body of literature on defending against this side-channel attack—malicious IoT traffic analytics (TA), there’s currently no systematic method to compare and evaluate the comprehensiveness of these existing studies. To address this problem, we design a new low-cost, open-source system framework—IoT Traffic Exposure Monitoring Toolkit (ITEMTK) that enables people to comprehensively examine and validate prior attack models and their defending approaches. During the design of ITEMTK, we also identified a novel image-based attack capable of inferring sensitive user information, even when users implement the most robust preventative measures in their smart homes. We then present a new, initial, prototype-level defense mechanism—PrivacyProtector, which could effectively defend against a wide range of state-of-the-art machine learning-based TA attacks, including our newly proposed image-based TA attacks. ITEMTK’s flexibility allows users’ easy expansion by integrating new TA attack models and defenses to benchmark their future work. 1},

abstract = {Flexible Electronics (FE) offer distinct advantages, including mechanical flexibility and low process temperatures, enabling extremely low-cost production. To address the demands of applications such as smart sensors and wearables, flexible devices must be small and operate at low supply voltages. Additionally, target applications often require classifiers to operate directly on analog sensory input, necessitating the use of Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs) to process the sensory data. However, ADCs present serious challenges, particularly in terms of high area and power consumption, especially when considering stringent area and energy budget. In this work, we target common classifiers in this domain such as MLPs and SVMs and present a holistic approach to mitigate the elevated overhead of analog to digital interfacing in FE. First, we propose a novel design for Binary Search ADC that reduces area overhead 2\texttimes{} compared with the state-of-the-art Binary design and up to 5.4\texttimes{} compared with Flash ADC. Next, we present an in-training ADC optimization in which we keep the bare-minimum representations required and simplifying ADCs by removing unnecessary components. Our in-training optimization further reduces on average the area in terms of transistor count of the required ADCs by 5\texttimes{} for less than 1% accuracy loss.},

abstract = {Dividing a single System-on-Chip (SoC) into multiple chiplets and integrating them via an interposer can achieve an optimal balance between continuous transistor integration and monetary cost. However, potential deadlock may arise between the chiplets and the interposer. This deadlock can be avoided by applying turn restriction or injection control on the boundary routers, at the cost of additional latency and suboptimal performance. Compared to deadlock avoidance, deadlock recovery exerts less impact on network performance. Nevertheless, accurate and timely deadlock detection, along with efficient deadlock recovery, continues to pose significant challenges. Additionally, modularity is a specific concern, which involves integrating chiplets of various functions, sizes, manufacturing processes, and so on. Minimizing the negative impact of deadlock resolution while maximizing modularity is crucial for achieving the benefit of chiplets.This article proposes a modular deadlock detection strategy, Up-Down, which monitors both the upward and downward directions of vertical channels, facilitating information exchange through the congestion-sense network. When a pair of blocked upward and downward vertical channels is detected simultaneously, it is considered that an inter-chiplet deadlock has occurred. This significantly enhances the accuracy of deadlock detection by two orders of magnitude compared to time-out deadlock detection. Furthermore, this article introduces Steered Bubble, a low-cost deadlock recovery algorithm. It does so by injecting bubbles into potential deadlock cycles identified by Up-Down. These bubbles follow preset paths, ensuring efficient deadlock recovery. Experimental results indicate that the Steered Bubble results in an average performance enhancement of 1% to 10% during full-system simulations, with an area overhead of less than 2%.},

In the scenarios of ultra-high data rate and high temporal sensitivity, it is difficult to transmit high-volume data from the satellite to the ground due to the limited satellite-to-ground data transmission link. Therefore, on-orbit computing becomes a superior choice. In this paper, an intelligent heterogeneous system is proposed for on-orbit computing of optical images. Key technologies, including lightweight intelligent processing algorithms, intelligent heterogeneous platforms and distributed computing, are researched aiming at achieving high performance on-orbit computing.

However, existing soil moisture sensors are too expensive to deploy in every pot. We therefore introduce GreenTag, a low-cost RFID-based soil moisture sensing system whose accuracy is comparable to that of an expensive soil moisture sensor. Our key idea is to attach two RFID tags to a plant’s container so that changes in soil moisture content are reflected in their Differential Minimum Response Threshold (DMRT) metric at the reader. We show that a low-pass filtered DMRT metric is robust to changes both in the RF environment (e.g., from human movement) and in pot locations. In addition, we propose a fast DMRT acquisition algorithm and a time-efficient tag query protocol, which can reduce the sensing latency by 90%. In a realistic setting, GreenTag achieves a 90-percentile moisture estimation errors of 5%, which is comparable to the 4% errors using expensive soil moisture sensors. Moreover, this accuracy is maintained despite changes in the RF environment and container locations. We also show the effectiveness of GreenTag in a real greenhouse.},

abstract = {Manoomin, the Ojibwe word for Northern Wild Rice, is a culturally significant food source native to the Western Great Lakes region of North America. For generations, Manoomin stewardship has been central to Ojibwe culture and identity, harvested using traditional methods which respect and enrich its growth. Recent years have shown a decline in Manoomin’s natural occurrence due to land-use change and global warming. As part of a broader conservation effort, our team has collaborated with Tribal partners to build Makak, a low-cost microclimate sensor that monitors factors affecting wild rice to support Tribal sovereignty. This article details our co-design and pilot deployment in collaboration with four partner organizations. Through this work, we share our experiences, and lessons learned from the co-design process with Tribal partners. With this work, we aim to provide insights to other projects that promote Indigenous-centric participatory, collaborative design methods for conservation and environmental sustainability.},

abstract = {Guide dogs provide vital support to individuals with visual impairments, yet the training process demands significant investment of time and resources. A significant component of this process is mutually identifying the right individual for each guide dog based on factors such as natural walking speed and handle-pull characteristics. We present a novel proof-of-concept wearable sensor system that records pull-force and harness motion data to aid in guide dog training and evaluation. The system integrates a modified harness with force sensors and an inertial measurement unit (IMU), providing a user-friendly and low-cost wireless solution for data collection during training sessions. Preliminary results show a strong correlation between average pull-force and profiling from professionals at a prominent guide dog school. Variations in left-to-right force distribution was found across individual dogs. Additionally, the system enables collection of motion data simultaneously with pull. We present early work validating pace and gait estimation using harness-based IMU data, with commercial gait analysis equipment as ground truth. We apply preliminary machine learning techniques to extract key features from pull and motion data with the goal of enabling advanced visualization and analysis of future gait and pull characteristics. As a quantitative objective tool, the presented system paves the way for improving guide dog training, optimizing dog-handler pairings, and potentially improving the success rate of dog training programs in general.},

abstract = {The domain gap between pretraining data (e.g., ImageNet, LUPerson) and downstream ReID datasets often leads to suboptimal performance when directly fine-tuning pretrained models. While existing methods attempt to bridge this gap by incorporating additional modalities (e.g., text, 3D data) or visual cues (e.g., pose, body masks), these approaches introduce two key limitations: (1) they may distract the model with irrelevant factors like background clutter or clothing variations, and (2) they inevitably increase computational overhead during inference. To address these issues, we propose the Weak Saliency Feedback Transformer (WSFFormer), inspired by the feedback mechanisms in biological visual systems. Unlike traditional one-way feature propagation, WSFFormer employs an adaptive feedback loop during training to enhance low-response regions, enabling the model to capture richer and more discriminative features. The WSFFormer introduces three key components: (1) The Lateral Feedback Module (LFM) mimics retinal lateral inhibition by adaptively suppressing high-response regions and amplifying weak discriminative features, forcing attention on subtle details; (2) The Progressive Feedback Module (PFM) refines feedback through deep-to-shallow closed-loop propagation, blending high-level semantics with spatial details; (3) The Feedback Sensitive Entropy Loss (FSE Loss) optimizes target-domain adaptation by quantifying divergence between forward and feedback-corrected features. Experiments on holistic/occluded ReID benchmarks show WSFFormer outperforms ViT/Swin-based SOTA methods without extra inference cost.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) can perform recommendation tasks by taking prompts written in natural language as input. Compared to traditional methods such as collaborative filtering, LLM-based recommendation offers advantages in handling cold-start, cross-domain, and zero-shot scenarios, as well as supporting flexible input formats and generating explanations of user behavior. In this paper, we focus on a single-user setting, where no information from other users is used. This setting is practical for privacy-sensitive or data-limited applications. In such cases, prompt engineering becomes especially important for controlling the output generated by the LLM. We conduct a large-scale comparison of 23 prompt types across 8 public datasets and 12 LLMs. We use statistical tests and linear mixed-effects models to evaluate both accuracy and inference cost. Our results show that for cost-efficient LLMs, three types of prompts are especially effective: those that rephrase instructions, consider background knowledge, and make the reasoning process easier to follow. For high-performance LLMs, simple prompts often outperform more complex ones while reducing cost. In contrast, commonly used prompting styles in natural language processing, such as step-by-step reasoning, or the use of reasoning models often lead to lower accuracy. Based on these findings, we provide practical suggestions for selecting prompts and LLMs depending on the required balance between accuracy and cost.},

However, their dynamic and unpredictable behavior—shifting over time and in response to environmental factors—poses challenges, often requiring costly equipment for accurate rheological analysis. This paper presents a low-cost, accessible sensing routine that retracts and extrudes viscous materials through an air tube, generating sensor vectors rich in rheological data. By embedding data from 26 rheologically diverse materials into a two-dimensional space, we create RheoMaps that allow for tracking material changes over time, distinguishing concentrations, and tuning rheological behaviors. These maps offer practical benefits for detecting preparation errors, guiding material design and documentation, and providing tutorial waypoints. We further discuss how this approach can be extended to extract relational insights from sensor data, improving material literacy and manipulation across a range of applications.},

While these exercises can be most effective when performed properly under the supervision of a physical therapist, it may not be a viable option for all patients. Thus, there is a growing trend towards at-home physical rehabilitation tracking systems as they can be more accessible and flexible for patients. However, existing systems mostly depend on camera and wearable based solutions, which can be costly and limited. To this end, we propose a low-cost and non-intrusive end-to-end solution using IoT-based wireless sensing devices. Our solution, Wi-PT-Hand, leverages Channel State Information (CSI) captured from ambient WiFi signals and uses Bayesian optimizers and a hierarchical deep learning model trained to recognize the prescribed hand exercises. The proposed system includes (i) segmentation of the therapy time into activity and non-activity durations, (ii) recognition of the exercise performed in an activity segment, and (iii) counting of the number of repetitions of the exercise performed within that segment. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed system is robust and performs well in various real life scenarios, and thanks to the lightweight design it can work on low-resource edge devices properly.},

abstract = {Controlling speaking style in text-to-speech (TTS) systems has become a growing focus in both academia and industry. While many existing approaches rely on reference audio to guide style generation, such methods are often impractical due to privacy concerns and limited accessibility. More recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to control speaking style through natural language prompts; however, their high computational cost, lack of interpretability, and sensitivity to prompt phrasing limit their applicability in real-time and resource-constrained environments. In this work, we propose ParaStyleTTS, a lightweight and interpretable TTS framework that enables expressive style control from text prompts alone. ParaStyleTTS features a novel two-level style adaptation architecture that separates prosodic and paralinguistic speech style modeling. It allows fine-grained and robust control over factors such as emotion, gender, and age. Unlike LLM-based methods, ParaStyleTTS maintains consistent style realization across varied prompt formulations and is well-suited for real-world applications, including on-device and low-resource deployment. Experimental results show that ParaStyleTTS generates high-quality speech with performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based systems while being 30x faster, using 8x fewer parameters, and requiring 2.5x less CUDA memory. Moreover, ParaStyleTTS exhibits superior robustness and controllability over paralinguistic speaking styles, providing a practical and efficient solution for style-controllable text-to-speech generation.

abstract = {Digital technologies, particularly Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks, have the potential to improve coordination and decision-making in community-managed dam operations, especially in rural and decentralized water systems. Despite advancements in real-time sensing and data-driven management, barriers such as fragmented governance, limited data accessibility, and operational constraints continue to hinder effective coordination across watersheds. Semi-structured interviews with dam operators in the Huron River watershed (Michigan, USA) identified critical institutional, operational, and technological challenges, including regulatory constraints on dam operations, reliance on manual flow monitoring, and a lack of accessible forecasting tools. To address these challenges, a low-cost, IoT-based decision support tool was developed and tested, integrating real-time sensor data, hydrologic conditions, and ecological forecasting into a web-based application. Results indicate that intuitive, data-driven interfaces improve information sharing, enhance operator trust in automation, and support watershed-scale coordinated management. Findings suggest that scalable IoT networks, when combined with human-centered design, bridge the gap between data availability and actionable decision making, ultimately fostering more adaptive, coordinated water resource management.},

abstract = {We present the first wireless earbud hardware that can perform hearing screening by detecting otoacoustic emissions. The conventional wisdom has been that detecting otoacoustic emissions, which are the faint sounds generated by the cochlea, requires sensitive and expensive acoustic hardware. Thus, medical devices for hearing screening cost thousands of dollars and are inaccessible in low and middle income countries. We show that by designing wireless ear-buds using low-cost acoustic hardware and combining them with wireless sensing algorithms, we can reliably identify otoacoustic emissions and perform hearing screening. Our algorithms combine frequency modulated chirps with wideband pulses emitted from a low-cost speaker to reliably separate otoacoustic emissions from in-ear reflections and echoes. We conducted a clinical study with 50 ears across two healthcare sites. Our study shows that the low-cost earbuds detect hearing loss with 100% sensitivity and 89.7% specificity, which is comparable to the performance of a $8000 medical device. By developing low-cost and open-source wearable technology, our work may help address global health inequities in hearing screening by democratizing these medical devices.Open-source hardware and code can be found here: https://github.com/uw-x/OAEbuds},

In this paper, we introduce VibRun, an unobtrusive gait analysis system that estimates key physiological metrics, such as cadence, ground contact time, stride time, center of pressure, and plantar pressure distribution, through footstep vibrations captured by low-cost treadmill-mounted sensors. Leveraging advanced multi-task transformer models, our system offers a robust, real-time solution to monitor and analyze running biomechanics without requiring intrusive wearable devices. This approach enables seamless integration into virtual sports, gaming platforms, and immersive exercise environments, enhancing the running experience by providing personalized feedback.

Extensive evaluations with 17 participants across varied treadmill running scenarios demonstrate VibRun's accuracy in real-time gait analysis. For instance, VibRun achieves a mean error of 28.8 ms in ground contact time and a distance of 13.66 mm in the center of pressure, among other measured metrics, highlighting its precise performance across multiple gait parameters.},

abstract = {Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a fundamental problem in vector databases and AI infrastructures. Recent graph-based ANNS algorithms have achieved high search accuracy with practical efficiency. Despite the advancements, these algorithms still face performance bottlenecks in production, due to the random memory access patterns of graph-based search and the high computational overheads of vector distance. In addition, the performance of a graph-based ANNS algorithm is highly sensitive to parameters, while selecting the optimal parameters is cost-prohibitive, e.g., manual tuning requires repeatedly re-building the index. This paper introduces VSAG, an open-source framework that aims to enhance the in production performance of graph-based ANNS algorithms. VSAG has been deployed at scale in the services of Ant Group, and it incorporates three key optimizations: (i) efficient memory access: it reduces L3 cache misses with pre-fetching and cache-friendly vector organization; (ii) automated parameter tuning: it automatically selects performance-optimal parameters without requiring index rebuilding; (iii) efficient distance computation: it leverages modern hardware, scalar quantization, and smartly switches to low-precision representation to dramatically reduce the distance computation costs. We evaluate VSAG on real-world datasets. The experimental results show that VSAG achieves the state-of-the-art performance and provides up to 4\texttimes{} speedup over HNSWlib (an industry-standard library) while ensuring the same accuracy.},

This study proposes a cross-modal learning framework based on inertial measurement units (IMUs) to infer plantar pressure distribution, ground reaction force (GRF), and center of pressure (COP). Traditional methods for pressure measurement rely on expensive and complex laboratory equipment, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. By integrating IMU data with deep learning techniques, this research achieves real-time, cost-effective, and accurate pressure estimation. The proposed method leverages IMU sensors to reconstruct foot pressure distribution in real-time, with high precision and adaptability to individual characteristics. A robust data pipeline and pretrained model enable accurate inference of GRF and COP using minimal IMU data, validated through case studies. Furthermore, The study builds a high-quality training dataset and optimizes the system for lightweight deployment, enhancing suitability for low-resource environments. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach across multiple evaluation metrics, particularly in individual adaptability, spatiotemporal feature capture, and deployment in resource-constrained settings. This work provides a novel and practical solution for clinical gait analysis, sports training, and health monitoring, while paving the way for advanced applications of intelligent devices in motion analysis.},

abstract = {To meet the increasing demand of deep learning (DL) models, AI chips are employing both off-chip memory (e.g., HBM) and high-bandwidth low-latency interconnect for direct inter-core data exchange. However, it is not easy to explore the efficiency of these inter-core connected AI (ICCA) chips, due to a fundamental tussle among compute (per-core execution), communication (inter-core data exchange), and I/O (off-chip data access). In this paper, we develop Elk , a DL compiler framework to maximize the efficiency of ICCA chips by jointly trading off all the three performance factors discussed above. Elk structures these performance factors into configurable parameters and forms a global trade-off space in the DL compiler. To systematically explore this space and maximize overall efficiency, Elk employs a new inductive operator scheduling policy and a cost-aware on-chip memory allocation algorithm. It generates globally optimized execution plans that best overlap off-chip data loading and on-chip execution. To examine the efficiency of Elk , we build a full-fledged emulator based on a real ICCA chip IPU-POD4, and an ICCA chip simulator for sensitivity analysis with different interconnect network topologies. Elk achieves 94% of the ideal roofline performance of ICCA chips on average, showing the benefits of supporting large DL models on ICCA chips. We also show Elk ’s capability of enabling architecture design space exploration for new ICCA chip development.},

The radar system does not suffer weather interference in outdoor environments. There are many ways to calculate the movement feature of the detect object. We discovered the need for micromotion detection to multiple targets with low costs. In this paper, we proposed a novel way to calculate multiple targets micromotion by reflected wave phase. The experimental results show that the proposed detection system and data process way have a more than 75% recognition and a less than 10% phase bias.

abstract = {Real-time stress detection using wearable devices offers valuable insights for mental health monitoring and well-being assessment. This study presents a TinyML-based stress classification model optimized for edge devices and wearable sensors, enabling continuous, low-power monitoring without reliance on cloud computing. The WESAD (Wearable Stress and Affect Detection) dataset was used to develop and evaluate the model, leveraging photoplethysmography (PPG) signals to classify stress levels. Multiple statistical time-domain features were extracted to capture relevant physiological patterns. Various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, including DNN, CNN, were assessed for their effectiveness in stress classification. Among these, an optimized DNN model demonstrated superior performance, achieving 98% accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. This makes it highly suitable for edge deployment, ensuring real-time stress detection with minimal resource consumption. The results validate the feasibility of TinyML-based stress classification on wearable devices, offering a cost-effective, real-time, and energy-efficient solution for continuous stress monitoring.

abstract = {This paper introduces MobiChem, a low-cost, portable, practical, and ubiquitous smartphone-based toolkit for fruit monitoring. The key idea is to leverage the light emitted from a smartphone's screen and front camera, coupled with a custom-built screen cover, to perform comprehensive hyperspectral analysis on targeted objects. Specifically, we designed a zero-powered screen cover that selectively filters wavelengths essential for hyperspectral sensing. We then incorporate a CNN-based algorithm and a novel ranking-based learning technique that manipulates the latent space to classify maturity stages and characterize their chemical and physical factors. To demonstrate MobiChem's feasibility, robustness, and practicality, we showcase its application in tomato, banana, and avocado sensing. Our system examines the maturity, chlorophyll, lycopene content, free sugar levels, and firmness, enabling various dietary assessments and food safety applications. Experimental results using 117 tomatoes, 98 bananas, and 73 avocados show MobiChem achieved 95.67% accuracy in chlorophyll concentration measurement, 98.76% for lycopene detection, 93.53% for sugar concentrations analysis, and 91.34% average accuracy in classifying maturity (96.64% for tomato, 86.37% for banana, and 91.03% for avocado).},

abstract = {There must be strict quality control to survive in manufacturing today, especially for long-lasting electronic components. This project uses traditional techniques like binomial distributions and Bayesian models, decision trees and dynamic programming, to model defect rates. It used Monte Carlo simulation and developed a profit maximization plan. The Bayesian model uses stale numbers and new samples in an attempt to inform decisions about defect rates. The study determined that 2,642 samples (95% confidence) or 1,341 samples (90% confidence) need to be used in order to confirm if defect levels exceed expectations, optimizing efficiency and accuracy. Costing allows for optimum low-cost and high-profit options to be determined. Step-by-step modeling tries inspection and repair costs to minimally decrease defects and costs. Monte Carlo and sensitivity analysis provide enhanced decision-making flexibility. Skipping inspection checks on parts that have been inspected and fixing defective returned products in the factory can at times be most lucrative, and manufacturers can use a simple formula to attain both quality and profit.},

Traditional fixed-site monitors often underestimate actual exposure levels. To address this, we introduce MobileSense, a low-cost mobile air quality monitoring platform that provides real-time PM2.5 data using a helmet-mounted sensor system with GPS tracking and alerts. A seven-month field study revealed that front line motorcycle riders experience significantly higher PM2.5 exposure than recorded by fixed monitors, exceeding WHO safety limits, even in the non polluted season. Health risk assessment using the Hazard Quotient (HQ) method classified 6 out of 10 riders as high-risk. To mitigate exposure, we evaluated three strategies: (1) a daily 1-hour break, (2) full days off on consecutive high-pollution days, and (3) full days off on peak pollution days. Bangkok riders benefit more from hourly breaks during rush hours, while Chiang Mai riders benefit more from full days off due to consistently high pollution levels. Our findings highlight the need for targeted exposure reduction strategies and provide valuable insights for protecting outdoor workers from air pollution.},

abstract = {RedCap mainly focuses on the lightweight terminal requirements in 5G cellular IoT technology, designed to fulfill specific application scenarios such as industrial wireless sensors, video surveillance and wearable devices. Lightweighting of the terminal is achieved by trimming the terminal complexity, reducing the number of antennas and lowering the modulation order. Compared to traditional 5G terminals, RedCap reduces terminal complexity by about 60%, while retaining the excellent features of 5G NR such as low latency and high reliability. Utilizing the R17 version of the standard RedCap protocol for 5G, we design a receiving and forwarding device based on 5G network signals, and test the actual performance of the module in two specific application scenarios, namely, smart communities and industrial parks, to validate the feasibility of the module in the corresponding business scenarios, and at the same time, it has the advantages of being easy to install, easy to maintain, and low cost.

abstract = {Reliable, frequent blood pressure (BP) monitoring outside clinical settings is crucial for cardiovascular health management, yet current wearable solutions often fail to deliver clinically accurate measurements in real-world conditions. A key limitation stems from the common reliance, particularly in convenient ring form factors, on photoplethysmography (PPG) sensing alone. PPG signals acquired from the finger are highly susceptible to physiological and environmental noise; notably, finger skin temperature fluctuations induce errors exceeding 10 mmHg due to vascular changes, while sensor-skin contact pressure further distorts the signal. This inherent sensitivity of PPG, when uncompensated, prevents many devices from consistently meeting clinical accuracy standards. We introduce FuSenseRing, an open-source smart ring engineered to overcome these issues through synergistic hardware-software co-design. FuSenseRing integrates a multimodal sensor suite (PPG, ECG, skin temperature, contact force) on a custom flexible PCB within a low-cost form factor, approximately $94.9 per unit at retail (batch of 5) and approximately $28.72 per unit at wholesale (batch of 500), while remaining lightweight (4.6 g) to ensure optimal signal acquisition during BP measurements. Our core algorithmic innovation is a Temperature-Adaptive Attention (TAA) mechanism that dynamically fuses PPG/ECG features and recalibrates their contributions using real-time temperature context to specifically mitigate thermal drift. Efficient personalization via transfer learning requires only 5-10 normal-temperature calibration samples. Through rigorous evaluations involving total 60 participants across diverse laboratory-controlled temperatures (17 °C to 40 °C skin temp) and challenging real-world ambulatory conditions (-10 °C to 24.4 °C ambient temp), we demonstrate FuSenseRing's effectiveness. Our system maintains high accuracy across the full temperature range (Overall SBP/DBP ME±STD: -0.09 ± 7.67 / 0.42 ± 5.74 mmHg), satisfying the stringent accuracy criteria of the FDA-recognized AAMI/ISO 81060-2 standard. Furthermore, FuSenseRing significantly outperformed three popular commercial BP rings in the real-world study.},

abstract = {Near Field Communication (NFC) is a widely applied technology embedded in credit cards, smartphones, and identity credentials like passports. By tapping a media to an NFC terminal, users can authorize payment transactions, gain access to spaces, and authenticate their identity. However, beyond tapping, current NFC application protocols define no other interactions, leaving significant room for exploration. In this work, we show that additional interactions can be enabled by analyzing the raw RX analog signals, which operate at high frequencies (848 kHz), using the test functions of an NFC terminal. We then sampled such signals using a custom low-cost, high-speed streaming ADC, enabling real-time streaming and visualization of the signals on an amplitude-phase plot. As users move the NFC media over the antenna, the raw signals form characteristic 2D curves on this plot. Accordingly, we identified three categories of card interactions: swipe, tap, and shake. By introducing asymmetric interference coils, we can further enable directional interactions. We showcase a set of 9 gestures based on these interaction categories and evaluated them in a ten-participant user study. Our classification model demonstrates cross-user accuracy of 91.8%, validating both our real-time processing pipeline and gesture design. To demonstrate the practical value of NFCGest, we propose applications for both display-based and display-less NFC terminals. We highlight purely contactless gesture interaction for display-based systems, and emphasize the enriched interaction space for display-less sensors.},

abstract = {Sensing in low-light and dark environments has a wide range of applications. However, existing sensing technologies suffer several major challenges, such as excessive noise and low resolution. In this work, we propose Mozart - a new mobile sensing system that leverages off-the-shelf Time-of-Flight (ToF) depth cameras to generate high-resolution and rich-in-texture maps for applications in dark scenarios. The design of Mozart is based on our key observation that the phase components of ToF measurements can be manipulated to expose texture information. Through in-depth analysis of the physical reflection model, we show that the textures can be exposed and enhanced using highly compute-efficient phase manipulation functions. Moreover, by exploiting the physics texture models, we propose an autoencoderbased unsupervised learning approach that can automatically learn efficient representations from phase components to generate high-resolution maps. We implemented Mozart on several Android smartphone models and an edge testbed with standalone ToF camera platforms for various applications in the dark. The results show that Mozart can work in real time and delivers significant improvement over existing sensing technologies. The demo video at https:// www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_sxyTZxIdU shows that Mozart offers a low-cost, highperformance sensing technology for nextgeneration applications in the dark.},

It guarantees confidentiality, authentication, and integrity using low bandwidth and CPU usage, while supporting high scalability and interoperability. We validate our solution in a threefold manner: via embedded board implementation, network simulation, and sea trials using commercially-available acoustic modems and underwater nodes. We also include a cost comparison among possible DLT choices. Results show AquaID to be robust to scaling, achieving low authentication delays and overhead, thus proving suitable even for large deployments.},

This paper explores the design space for RF infrastructure to charge battery-free devices (e.g. RFID) or devices with coin-cell batteries (e.g. water and security sensors) over much longer range than the state-of-the-art. Rather than rely completely on ambient RF (e.g. TV towers) or dedicated infrastructure (e.g. RFID readers), we explore a middle path - combine RF energy from (nearly) all available major wireless frequency bands and then supplement this with low-cost specially designed RF charging infrastructure to fill in any gaps.We propose SCALED, an architecture that extends the energy-harvesting range of ultra-low-power platforms. We explore two design questions: (1) The design of the energy harvester, including which ambient frequency bands to combine as well as overall modalities to combine energy rather than focus on one band; (2) The design of radio infrastructure to fill-in the coverage gaps of ambient energy, with minimal interference to communication sources. We implement and study SCALED through a multi-pronged evaluation including building-scale proof-of-concept deployments.},

abstract = {Over the last 15 years, several popular systematic abstraction frameworks have emerged---frameworks that allow a static analysis to be derived by systematically transforming a concrete semantics. These frameworks guarantee computability of the resulting artifact by the application of an a priori abstraction which induces a particular finitization in the execution space. While effective, this abstraction occurs without regard for program structure, subjecting each program point to the same fixed degree of context sensitivity. In this paper, we present CGADI, an enhancement to systematic abstraction frameworks based on definitional interpreters which defers abstraction until a parameterized safety property signals that it should be applied. We then examine this enhanced framework instantiated with two such safety properties: a simple reentrancy property which detects non-recursive portions of program execution, and a size change property which detects evaluation paths destined to converge by virtue of appropriately decreasing values along them. The result is that CGADI can operate in the fully-precise concrete space for portions of execution without forfeiting computability. Our evaluation demonstrates that CGADI is able to produce a higher number of precise results than a corresponding CFA at relatively low cost and that, with no special treatment, CGADI can handle many programming patterns targeted by specific analysis techniques.},

abstract = {Inventory item classification is one of the crucial topics in inventory management, directly affecting the benefits to a business. Effective inventory management can lead to better cost control and more efficient budget allocation. However, inventory classification is subject to several criteria. Therefore, this paper proposes a new approach considering three criteria of Annual Dollar Usage (ADU), Average Unit Cost (AUC), and Lead Time (LT) for inventory item classification. The Fuzzy Inference System (FIS), an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), was applied as a powerful tool to assess inventory item evaluation scores for each item based on multi-criteria and fuzzy rules. The systematic item categorization referring to the three-sigma control limits concept was also introduced in this paper. The proposed method identifies and assigns items into classes “A+”, “A”, “B”, “C”, and “C-”. Unlike other inventory classification methods, items with extremely high evaluation scores are classified into Class A+, while items with extremely low scores are categorized into Class C-. This method gives more information to the decision-makers to rigorously monitor the sensitive items. Moreover, the comparative study firmly showed that the proposed method obtained effective solutions, making inventory item classification more reasonable and efficient.},

abstract = {Notifying the relevant personnel in a timely manner to perform a rescue after an elderly person has fallen helps mitigate injury. For this reason, this design proposes an automatic alarm system based on an STM32 microcontroller for elderly falls. The system uses an ADXL345 acceleration sensor to monitor body posture and determine if a fall has occurred. It also uses a GPS module for positioning and a GSM module for sending SMS alerts. The hardware circuit design, PCB version production, component welding, and system software design and code writing are complete. Simulation experiment results show that the system can immediately sound a light and sound alarm and inform the guardian of the accident location (latitude and longitude) by sending an SMS, facilitating timely rescue measures and reducing injuries caused by falls. The system has the advantages of a compact structure, portability, simple operation, and low cost. It has certain application prospects in the field of intelligent recreation.},

abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar systems are widely used for object detection and tracking in critical applications, but recent research has exposed their vulnerability to vanish attacks. This paper extends the vanish attack -- previously demonstrated on a single radar -- to multiple radar systems operating at 24 GHz, 66 GHz, and 77 GHz. We utilize meta-material-enhanced tags to interfere with radar signals passively, effectively rendering real objects undetectable. We describe a methodology for designing and deploying these low-cost meta-material tags and evaluate the attack's effectiveness across different radar frequencies. Experimental results show that the meta-material tags successfully cause objects to "disappear" from all three radar systems, drastically reducing detection accuracy at each frequency. The study's contributions include demonstrating the generalizability of the vanish attack across diverse mmWave radar bands, analyzing performance differences by frequency, and discussing countermeasures. Our findings confirm that meta-material tag attacks pose a serious threat to mmWave sensing, underscoring the need for improved radar security and multi-sensor defenses.},

abstract = {Learning-based environmental sound recognition has emerged as a crucial method for ultra-low-power environmental monitoring in biological research and city-scale sensing systems. These systems usually operate under limited resources and are often powered by harvested energy in remote areas. Recent efforts in on-device sound recognition suffer from low accuracy due to resource constraints, whereas cloud offloading strategies are hindered by high communication costs. In this work, we introduce ORCA, a novel resource-efficient cloud-assisted environmental sound recognition system on batteryless devices operating over the Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs), targeting wide-area audio sensing applications. We propose a cloud assistance strategy that remedies the low accuracy of on-device inference while minimizing the communication costs for cloud offloading. By leveraging a self-attention-based cloud sub-spectral feature selection method to facilitate efficient on-device inference, ORCA resolves three key challenges for resource-constrained cloud offloading over LPWANs: 1) high communication costs and low data rates, 2) dynamic wireless channel conditions, and 3) unreliable offloading. We implement ORCA on an energy-harvesting batteryless microcontroller and evaluate it in a real world urban sound testbed. Our results show that ORCA outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 80\texttimes{} in energy savings and 220\texttimes{} in latency reduction while maintaining comparable accuracy.},

abstract = {High-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging is an essential technique for overcoming the dynamic range limits of image sensors. The classic method relies on multiple exposures, which slows capture time, resulting in motion artifacts when imaging dynamic scenes. Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR data in a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many established methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed detail; these approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. In this work, we demonstrate a novel single-shot HDR capture method that utilizes the global reset release (GRR) shutter mode commonly found in off-the-shelf sensors. GRR shutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the sensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the sensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene. The resulting exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization problem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many sensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at modest saturation (1%). Finally, we demonstrate a physical lab prototype that uses an off-the-shelf random fiber bundle for the optical shuffling. The fiber bundle is coupled to a low-cost commercial sensor operating in GRR shutter mode. Our prototype achieves a dynamic range of up to 73dB using an 8-bit sensor with 48dB dynamic range.},

abstract = {3D object detection with omnidirectional views enables safety-critical applications such as mobile robot navigation. Such applications increasingly operate on resource-constrained edge devices, facilitating reliable processing without privacy concerns or network delays. To enable cost-effective deployment, cameras have been widely adopted as a low-cost alternative to LiDAR sensors. However, the compute-intensive workload to achieve high performance of camera-based solutions remains challenging due to the computational limitations of edge devices. In this paper, we present Panopticus, a carefully designed system for omnidirectional and camera-based 3D detection on edge devices. Panopticus employs an adaptive multi-branch detection scheme that accounts for spatial complexities. To optimize the accuracy within latency limits, Panopticus dynamically adjusts the model's architecture and operations based on available edge resources and spatial characteristics. We implemented Panopticus on three edge devices and conducted experiments across real-world environments based on the public self-driving dataset and our mobile 360° camera dataset. Experiment results showed that Panopticus improves accuracy by 62% on average given the strict latency objective of 33ms. Also, Panopticus achieves a 2.1\texttimes{} latency reduction on average compared to baselines.},

abstract = {Cloud providers deployed dozens of PoPs and data centers globally to serve billions of geo-distributed users. The traffic management at peering edges has become a key capability of cloud network operators to meet the diverse demands of users. With the rapid growth of cloud applications, users have recently announced new performance requirements, e.g., achieving latency as low as possible instead of maintaining a specified delay. The conventional inter-domain bandwidth allocation approach, which aims to reduce the high operating expenditures of bandwidth usage, fails to meet these new requirements. We further reveal that the flow scheduling among PoPs may fail due to the limited link capacity hidden by the cloud private backbone network controller. Therefore we seek a new traffic management at peering edges.We propose a new controller framework, EdgeCross, that satisfies not only users' emerging demands but maintains low operating costs. The large number of fine-grain application-aware flows and the consideration of backbone links' capacity lead to very high complexity of routing computation and verification for the controller. EdgeCross introduces a two-phase operation that first achieves the low-expense bandwidth allocation according to the standard 95th percentile billing model and then allocates specified flows to peering edges based on users' requirements. EdgeCross further reduces large memory consumption by proposing an effective routing table compression approach. The evaluation based on a production network with 16 PoPs has shown that EdgeCross can successfully process the routes of 1 billion flows in 10 seconds, reduce the average delay for performance-sensitive flows by 2 milliseconds compared to traditional BGP, and is able to save the bandwidth cost by 10-26% compared to the state-of-the-art Cascara.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consist of small, low-cost, low-power sensors deployed to monitor environmental changes and transmit data to a static base station. A major challenge in WSNs is energy consumption, particularly in nodes near the static sink, leading to the "hotspot" or "energy hole" problem, which disrupts data transmission and reduces network lifespan. Traditional approaches with static sinks and multi-hop routing often result in premature node failure and data loss. This paper introduces an Efficient Burst Traffic-Aware Clustering and Mobility Management (EBTCM) model to optimize the energy efficiency and data collection process in mobile sink-based heterogeneous WSNs (mWSNs). The proposed model is particularly effective in managing burst traffic, where sudden surges of data must be collected promptly to avoid loss, and uses Mobile Sinks (MS) to dynamically adjust routes. It leverages clustering techniques and mobile sink routing based on the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) to extend the network lifetime, reduce energy consumption, and efficiently manage both regular and burst traffic. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in path length reduction, energy efficiency, and network longevity compared to existing approaches, highlighting the potential of the proposed model in real-world WSN applications.},

abstract = {The Field of View (FoV) is a central technical display characteristic of Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs), which has been shown to have a notable impact on important aspects of the user experience. For example, an increased FoV has been shown to foster a sense of presence and improve peripheral information processing, but it also increases the risk of VR sickness. This article investigates the impact of a wider but inhomogeneous FoV on the perceived plausibility, measuring its effects on presence, spatial presence, and VR sickness as a comparison to and replication of effects from prior work. We developed a low-resolution peripheral display extension to pragmatically increase the FoV, taking into account the lower peripheral acuity of the human eye. While this design results in inhomogeneous resolutions of HMDs at the display edges, it also is a low complexity and low-cost extension. However, its effects on important VR qualities have to be identified. We conducted two experiments with 30 and 27 participants, respectively. In a randomized 2x3 within-subject design, participants played three rounds of bowling in VR, both with and without the display extension. Two rounds contained incongruencies to induce breaks in plausibility. In experiment 2, we enhanced one incongruency to make it more noticeable and improved the shortcomings of the display extension that had previously been identified. However, neither study measured the low-resolution FoV extension’s effect in terms of perceived plausibility, presence, spatial presence, or VR sickness. We found that one of the incongruencies could cause a break in plausibility without the extension, confirming the results of a previous study.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) on tiny edge devices has become feasible thanks to the emergence of high-performance microcontrollers (MCUs) and lightweight machine learning (ML) models. Nevertheless, the cost and power consumption of these MCUs and the computation requirements of these ML algorithms still present barriers that prevent the widespread inclusion of AI functionality on smaller, cheaper, and lower-power devices. Thus, there is an urgent need for a more efficient ML algorithm and implementation strategy suitable for lower-end MCUs.This paper presents MicroVSA, a library of optimized implementations of a low-dimensional computing (LDC) classifier, a recently proposed variant of vector symbolic architecture (VSA), for 8, 16, and 32-bit MCUs. MicroVSA achieves up to 21.86x speedup and 8x less flash utilization compared to the vanilla LDC. Evaluation results on the three most common always-on inference tasks - myocardial infarction detection, human activity recognition, and hot word detection - demonstrate that MicroVSA outperforms traditional classifiers and achieves comparable accuracy to tiny deep learning models, while requiring only a few ten bytes of RAM and can easily fit in tiny 8-bit MCUs. For instance, our model for recognizing human activity from inertial sensor data only needs 2.46 KiB of flash and 0.02 KiB of RAM and can complete one inference in 0.85 ms on a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 MCU or 11.82 ms on a tiny 8-bit AVR MCU, whereas the RNN model running on a higher-end ARM Cortex-M3 requires 62.0 ms. Our study suggests that ubiquitous ML deployment on low-cost tiny MCUs is possible, and more study on VSA model training, model compression, and implementation techniques is needed to further lower the cost and power of ML on edge devices.},

abstract = {In heterogeneous three-dimensional Network-on-Chip (3-D NoC) systems, security threats arise from malicious nodes in untrusted dies that disrupt data flow and leak proprietary information. To mitigate such risks, a security-aware priority-based packet routing algorithm is proposed. The developed routing methodology prioritizes routing security sensitive data packets through trusted dies. The algorithm dynamically computes a cost metric that accounts for router utilization, distance between the source and destination nodes, directions of traversal, and packet priority, and determines whether data is routed via a slower but secure path or a faster yet compromised path. High-priority packets are reliably delivered, while low-priority packets that tolerate delay traverse untrusted dies. When high-priority packets are sparse and the untrusted die is placed as the middle plane of a three-tier 3-D IC stack, the algorithm reduces high-priority packet hops in the untrusted die by approximately ( 95% ), averaged across flit sizes and packet generation rates, while the increase in average packet latency and dynamic power consumption is ( 4.53% ) and ( 4.46% ), respectively. Running t-tests to compare ZXYZ routing and the proposed routing algorithm yield p-values of 0.3347 and 0.6322 for average packet latency and dynamic power consumption, respectively, which indicates no significant difference in performance and power consumption.},

LiSWARM provides robust and precise localization and recognition of drones in 3D space, which is not possible with state-of-the-art drone tracking systems that rely on radio-frequency (RF), acoustic, or RGB image signatures. It includes (1) an efficient data processing pipeline to process the point clouds, (2) robust priority-aware clustering algorithms to isolate swarm data from the background, (3) a reliable neural network-based algorithm to recognize the drones, and (4) a technique to track the trajectory of every drone in the swarm. We develop the LiSWARM prototype and validate it through both in-lab and field experiments. Notably, we measure its performance during two drone light shows involving 150 and 500 drones and confirm that the system achieves up to 98% accuracy in recognizing drones and reliably tracking drone trajectories. To evaluate the scalability of LiSWARM, we conduct a thorough analysis to benchmark the system's performance with a swarm consisting of 15,000 drones. The results demonstrate the potential to leverage LiSWARM for other applications, such as battlefield operations, errant drone detection, and securing sensitive areas such as airports and prisons.},

abstract = {Running is a beneficial form of exercise that promotes cardiovascular health, strengthens muscles, and assists in weight management across all age groups. However, abnormal running posture can cause excessive fatigue and increase the risk of injuries. This study proposes a continuous detection method for abnormal running posture based on wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs), aiming to efficiently classify and recognize abnormal running postures through deep learning models by utilizing raw data collected from wearable inertial sensors. Firstly, a systematic comparison of long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and Transformer models shows that the four-layer Transformer model achieved a test accuracy of 85.2%, which is superior to that of LSTM and GRU models in terms of classification accuracy. In addition, the study found that using both the accelerometer and gyroscope signals significantly improves classification performance by comparing different sensor signals. Finally, it was found that a single IMU mounted on the waist or chest can effectively replace a dual-IMU combination without compromising detection accuracy, thus supporting a low-cost, low-burden running posture monitoring solution. This study provides an innovative solution for real-time monitoring of abnormal running posture and provides guidance for deep learning model selection, sensor signal configuration, and mounting placement.},

abstract = {Geosciences have witnessed a revolution in data collection thanks to the Internet of Things (IoT), which has made it possible to monitor complex phenomena using sensor networks. However, developing web-centric, sensor-based, data warehousing information systems presents challenges because of their complexity and cost. This paper presents an intuitive low-code development system (called SensorPublisher), based on a software product line (SPL) and a domain-specific language (DSL), that speeds up the creation of data warehousing applications for geographic sensor data. SensorPublisher allows the geoscientist to define the sensor network, to generate a software product, and to deploy the product to a local or a remote server. Our tool seeks to encourage scientists to share the outcomes of their sensor data analysis projects with their communities by means of a simple, user-friendly and cost-effective approach. We showcase the system in different geoscientific domains, such as meteorological monitoring services, traffic data and air quality monitoring in urban areas, and marine area monitoring systems.},

abstract = {Soil monitoring plays an essential role in agricultural systems. Rather than deploying sensors' antennas above the ground, burying them in the soil is an attractive way to retain a non-intrusive aboveground space. Low Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) has shown its long-distance and low-power features for aboveground Internet-of-Things (IoT) communication, presenting a potential of extending to underground cross-soil communication over a wide area, which however has not been investigated before. The variation of soil conditions brings significant signal polarization misalignment, degrading communication reliability. In this paper, we propose Demeter, a low-cost low-power programmable antenna design to keep reliable cross-soil communication automatically. First, we propose a hardware architecture to enable polarization adjustment on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) single-RF-chain LoRa radio. Moreover, we develop a low-power programmable circuit to obtain polarization adjustment. We further design an energy-efficient heuristic calibration algorithm and an adaptive calibration scheduling method to keep signal polarization alignment automatically. We implement Demeter with a customized PCB circuit and COTS devices. Then, we evaluate its performance in various soil types and environmental conditions. The results show that Demeter can achieve up to 11.6 dB SNR gain indoors and 9.94 dB outdoors, 4\texttimes{} horizontal communication distance, at least 20 cm deeper underground deployment, and up to 82% energy consumption reduction per day compared with the standard LoRa.},

abstract = {The massive deployment of soil moisture and temperature sensors inside agricultural plots will become essential in the next years to meet the challenges of the agroecological transition. In such a context, the use of buried communicating sensor nodes is particularly relevant because they are protected underground from human activities, animals, and agricultural machinery. Their communication range is however limited to a few meters above the ground, that leads to difficulties in collecting their data remotely. One possible solution is to use one or several UAVs to visit them successively. Nevertheless, this approach requires being able to take into account the presence of obstacles at low flight height in the path planning algorithms, and to solve the Close Enough Traveling Salesman Problem (CE-TSP) in cluttered environments. To meet this need, the objective of this article is to present the possibility of exploiting real data from an airborne Light Detection and Ranging sensor (LiDAR) to determine the location and height of obstacles in the workspace of the UAV. Based on this data, a cost matrix associated to the trajectories between each node can be calculated, with the possibility for the UAV to fly above the obstacle areas. Next, to optimize the route of the UAV in the CE-TSP framework, this article presents a simple approach based on a Partheno Genetic Algorithm&nbsp;(PGA) completed with some heuristic rules. Our method is applied in a real use case consisting of 50 sensor nodes distributed in our experimental farm. The results highlight the performances of the method proposed. They demonstrate the capabilities of our method to address the CE-TSP with obstacles, and open the way to future prospects for collecting data of buried sensor nodes using UAVs.},

Various devices have been developed to overcome these limitations, but they are often accompanied by high prices or technological barriers, potentially hindering widespread adoption and research replication. To address this, we aim to design a low-cost, open-source device providing additional sensory feedback to support accessible navigation. Therefore, we introduce Tangible Compass, a handheld haptic device as an add-on for smartphone navigation functions, providing force guidance in various accessible navigation scenarios. Its functionality is achieved through smartphone sensor data streaming, scenario-based algorithmic force rendering, and a compact one Degree of Freedom (1-DoF) kinesthetic device transmitting forces. We detail the processes and results of structural designs, system setups, and force rendering algorithms for any replication and design alternation. To demonstrate real-world applications, we present three interaction scenarios with manipulating Tangible Compass: route orientation navigation, notification procedures, and forward clearance detection.},

abstract = {In everyday life, we often experience the sensation of wind across our bodies, such as during outdoor activities. In the field of virtual reality (VR), prior studies have focused on producing wide-area wind by numerous fans or simulating virtual wind sensations through cross-modal effects. However, existing methods often require complex and large equipment to present the wind sensation across the entire body. This study addresses these limitations by investigating how full-body wind sensations through cross-modal effects can be achieved with low device costs. Specifically, we examine the influence of the number and placement of haptic devices on the perception of full-body wind. Through user experiments involving head-mounted displays and multisensory feedback devices, we found that increasing the number of stimulation points enhances the perception of full-body wind, and that stimulating the arms and legs is particularly effective for evoking a full-body sensation. Furthermore, we also confirmed that achieving the full-body wind sensation was accompanied by increases in relaxation, a sense of openness, and wind comfort. Our results provide a practical design for cost-effective haptic systems that simulate full-body wind sensations, paving the way for more immersive applications in relaxation, gaming, and virtual tourism.},

abstract = {As global climate patterns become increasingly unpredictable, the need for precise and localized climate data becomes more important. Traditional environmental monitoring systems often fail to engage local communities, creating a disconnect between institutional data collection and grassroots environmental stewardship. Citizen science can offer a valuable paradigm for involving the public in hyperlocal data collection and promoting community awareness. Citizen science empowers communities to collect pertinent environmental data tailored to their unique challenges. However, crafting effective local citizen science initiatives poses challenges like ensuring data reliability and integrating local expertise.Our research team collaborated with a local non-profit organization to develop a "Social Sensor Network" that combines physical environmental sensors with a social network of citizen scientists, aiming to efficiently collect hyperlocal environmental data. Over three months, we deployed the SSN in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, engaging 17 residents in a collaborative process of environmental data collection and interpretation. The automatic data collection process using low-cost sensors, complemented by the contextual insights of the participants, led to the gathering of highly detailed air quality data, exceeding official monitoring capacities. Participants actively participated in data comparison, trend identification, and environmental data exploration. The project reveals how experiential learning in citizen science cultivates not just environmental awareness but also collective agency among participants. The data collected by the participants supported our partner non-profit organization to create environmental assessments and carry out interventions. Our study also demonstrates how partnerships between local organizations and researchers can transform citizen science into a platform for community-driven environmental advocacy.},

abstract = {The best arm identification problem in multi-armed bandit model has been widely applied into many practical applications, such as spectrum sensing, online advertising, and cloud computing. Although lots of works have been devoted into this area, most of them do not consider the cost of pulling actions, i.e., a player has to pay some cost when she pulls an arm. Motivated by this, we study a ratio-based best arm identification problem, where each arm is associated with a random reward as well as a random cost. For any  (deltain(0,1)) , with probability at least  (1-delta) , the player aims to find the arm with the largest ratio of expected reward to expected cost using as few samplings as possible. Specifically, we consider two settings: (1) the precise setting, i.e., identifying the precise optimal one; (2) the Probably Approximate Correct (PAC) setting, which identifies the  (epsilon) -optimal one. For the precise setting, we design the elimination-type algorithms and provide a fundamental lower bound which asymptotically matches the upper bound, while in the PAC setting, an UCB-type algorithm which amed  (epsilon) -RCB algorithm is proposed. We show that for all algorithms, the sample complexities, i.e., the pulling times for all arms, grow logarithmically as  (frac{1}{delta})  increases. Moreover, compared to existing works, the running of our algorithms is independent of the arm-related parameters, which is more practical. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through numerical experiments.},

abstract = {Nowadays, light sensors are frequently utilized as wearables for assessing personal light exposure or installed in indoor environments for measuring ambient lighting at areas of interest. Interestingly, light emitted by computer screens records distinct patterns when such sensors are placed nearby. The phenomenon requires analysis for passive sensing and also raises critical privacy concerns. In this paper, we introduce ScreenSense, an innovative approach that leverages data from existing framework for detecting screen utilization. For that, we first collect a diversified dataset by placing a light sensor in close proximity to computer screen. We then classify captured dataset into five general categories: Mail, Social, Reading, Video, and No Activity. Our insight is that existing low-power, inexpensive light sensors can be an energy-efficient, low-cost alternative for collecting screen information over extended periods. However, we also observe that for to be effective in real-world, it needs to be robust against several practical factors, including the ambient room lighting where the user device is situated, transitioning between different activities, and examples from unfamiliar arrangements. To overcome these challenges, we propose dataset augmentation including realistic lighting conditions, transition filters, and time series-based augmentation. The system achieves a detection accuracy upto 91.25% in real world testbed scenarios. ScreenSense also uncovers critical privacy issues inherent in simple IoT based light sensors deployed so commonly in smart buildings.},

abstract = {Online support groups for smoking cessation provide an accessible, cost-effective method for assisting individuals looking to quit. However, these groups often face challenges related to low user engagement and the stigma associated with smoking cessation. Non-native English speakers encounter additional barriers in accessing effective support, as language differences increase feelings of isolation and discourage participation. To address these issues, this study focuses on developing a multilingual conversational agent designed to offer real-time, culturally sensitive support in multiple languages, including Mandarin, Arabic, Hindi, Spanish, and Farsi. A critical aspect of the system is intent classification, enabling the agent to understand user inputs and generate contextually appropriate responses. Due to the limited availability of high-quality training data in non-English languages, we introduce a synthetic data augmentation strategy that combines both synthetic data generation and real data scraping. Initially, we fine-tune a pre-trained large language model on multilingual smoking cessation group data. To enhance intent detection accuracy, we augment the training dataset by generating synthetic posts using advanced prompt engineering. We compare the performance of the fine-tuned LLM with its non-fine-tuned counterpart, demonstrating that synthetic data augmentation results in a 35.5% increase in F1 scores. This improvement validates the effectiveness of our augmentation approach in boosting the accuracy of non-English conversational agents. By integrating this conversational agent into widely used social media platforms, such as GroupMe or X, we aim to offer a scalable, inclusive solution that reduces stigma, enhances engagement, and improves the effectiveness of smoking cessation programs for non-native English speakers.},

abstract = {Spectrum sensing plays a crucial role in spectrum monitoring and management. However, due to the expensive cost of high-speed ADCs, wideband spectrum sensing is a long-standing challenge. In this paper, we present how to transform Ultra-wideband (UWB) devices into a spectrum sensor which can provide wideband spectrum monitoring at a low cost. Compared with the expensive high-speed ADCs which cost at least hundreds of dollars, a UWB device is only several dollars. As the low-cost UWB technology is not originally designed for spectrum sensing, we address the inherent limitations of low-cost devices such as limited memory, low SPI speed and low accuracy, and show how to obtain spectrum occupancy information from the noisy and spurious UWB channel impulse response. In this paper, we present WISE, which not only can give accurate channel occupancy information, but also can precisely estimate the signal power and bandwidth. WISE can also detect fleeting radar signals. We implement WISE and perform extensive evaluations with both controlled experiments and field tests. Results show that WISE can sense up to 900MHz bandwidth and the power estimation error is less than 3dB. WISE can also accurately detect busy 5G channels. We believe that WISE provides a new paradigm for low-cost wideband spectrum sensing, which is critical for large-scale fine-grained spectrum monitoring.},

This paper presents the design and development process of Purry, a social robot inspired by cat behaviors, created to provide stress relief for university students. Purry was designed to offer emotional comfort in a unique way, harnessing the calming effects of pet-like interactions. The design process focused on achieving both aesthetic appeal and functional efficiency, combining modern and traditional technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and low-cost materials, following the double diamond methodology. The robot mimics feline behaviors like kneading and purring, exploring both active and passive tactile interactions, which have been shown to reduce stress through sensory stimulation. Iterative development cycles, guided by user feedback, led to significant advancements in balancing form and function.

abstract = {Accurate calibration of low-cost sensors is critical for improving their potential in environmental monitoring. State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods based on supervised learning commonly calibrate sensor measurements with ground truth from the immediate past or future. However, these techniques rely heavily on labeled data which is challenging to obtain in real-world scenarios. Thus, this paper introduces CaliFormer, a novel representation learning model using self-supervised learning to extract time- and spatial-invariant knowledge from unlabeled measurements. Moreover, we propose pre-training enhancements and model architecture modifications to help train CaliFormer. We then fine-tune the calibration model with the learned representations, which is supervised by limited labeled data. Finally, we comprehensively evaluate our calibration model with a dataset collected by low-cost sensors. Results show that our model outperforms other SOTA calibration methods significantly.},

abstract = {The recent trend of watching content using over-the-top (OTT) services pushes the 4D movie industry to seek a way of transformation. To address the issue, this paper suggests an AI-driven automatic 4D effects generation algorithm applied to a low-cost comfort chair. The system extracts multiple features using psychoacoustic analysis, saliency detection, optical flow, and an LLM-based thermal effect synthesis, and maps them into various sensory displays such as vibration, heat, wind, and poking automatically. To evaluate the system, a user study with 21 participants across seven film genres was conducted. The results showed that 1) there was a general improvement with 4D effects in terms of immersion, concentration, and expressiveness, and 2) multisensory effects were particularly useful in action and fantasy movie scenes. The suggested system could be directly used in current general video-on-demand services.},

Eciton reduces memory and chip resource requirements via 8-bit quantization and hard sigmoid activation, allowing the accelerator as well as the recurrent neural network model parameters to fit in a low-cost, low-power Lattice iCE40 UP5K FPGA.We evaluate Eciton on multiple, established time-series classification applications including predictive maintenance of mechanical systems, sound classification, and intrusion detection for IoT nodes. Binary and multi-class classification edge models are explored, demonstrating that Eciton can adapt to a variety of deployable environments and remote use cases. Eciton demonstrates real-time processing at a very low power consumption with minimal loss of accuracy on multiple inference scenarios with differing characteristics, while achieving competitive power efficiency against the state-of-the-art of similar scale. We show that the addition of this accelerator actually reduces the power budget of the sensor node by reducing power-hungry wireless transmission. The resulting power budget of the sensor node is small enough to be powered by a power harvester, potentially allowing it to run indefinitely without a battery or periodic maintenance.},

abstract = {The proliferation of networked devices and the surging demand for ubiquitous intelligence have given rise to the artificial intelligence of things (AIoT). However, the utilization of high-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and numerous radio frequency chains significantly raises power consumption. This article explores a cost-effective solution using ternary ADCs (T-ADCs) in massive multiple-input–multiple-output systems for low-power AIoT and specifically addresses channel sensing challenges. The channel is first estimated through a pilot-aided scheme and refined using a joint-pilot-and-data (JPD) approach. To assess the performance limits of this two-threshold ADC system, the analysis includes its hardware-ideal counterpart, the parallel one-bit ADCs and a realistic scenario where noise variance is unknown at the receiver is considered. Analytical findings indicate that the JPD scheme effectively mitigates performance degradation in channel estimation due to coarse quantization effects under mild conditions, without necessitating additional pilot overhead. For deterministic and random channels, we propose modified expectation maximization (EM) and variational inference EM estimators, respectively. Extensive simulations validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimators in terms of mean square error and symbol error rate, which showcases the feasibility of implementing T-ADCs and the associated JPD scheme for greener AIoT smart sensing.},

We present FireLoc, a fast and accurate wildfire crowdsensing system that localizes and maps wildfires combining ground cameras and landscape data.Prior image-based localization techniques fail in vegetated areas as they are tuned for close-range human-built environments. Instead, FireLoc integrates monocular depth mapping models, topography models, and cross-camera methods to achieve over 1000m range in vegetated environments leveraging low-cost smartphones. Due to the paucity of historical wildfire data, we built a wildfire simulator to provide additional data for validation. We show that FireLoc surpasses prior wildfire mapping work and reduces wildfire mapping time from hours to seconds.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of industry, the newly added equipment is also evolving towards being large, complex, precise, high-speed, and capable of continuous operation. Real-time monitoring of the operational status of touch screen devices, timely detection of early faults, identification of fault sources, and elimination of faults can provide crucial guarantees for the safety of enterprise equipment or personnel. Since the vibration signal varies with the state of the touchscreen component, it can reflect the mechanical operation status. Therefore, through the analysis and processing of vibration signals, the nature and severity of the problem can be determined, thereby analyzing and monitoring the real-time operating status of the touch screen. To achieve real-time monitoring of the touchscreen status, the vibration signal acquisition, signal processing and signal analysis adopted should have the characteristics of high real-time performance, good portability, strong anti-interference ability and adaptability to various environments. The piezoelectric sensor with small size, fast response and wide adaptability is used to collect the signal of the touch screen status. High-speed acquisition of vibration signals and high-speed data communication are carried out using FPGA chips. The signal processing function of LABVIEW is used to process the vibration signal in real time. Real-time analysis enables the monitoring and fault detection of different touch screens in different environments at a relatively low cost, or it is used to assist in fault detection and fault data recording.},

abstract = {The growth of urban centers, the impacts of climate change, and the need for information to inform city planning and community organizing have intensified the need for monitoring solutions in cities. The advancement of low-cost sensor technologies and digital twin frameworks presents an opportunity for cities to deploy extensive, real-time monitoring systems. However, few examples of long-term, large-scale, publicly available urban sensor datasets exist, limiting the ability of researchers and planners to explore important topics such as hyperlocal environmental variations. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive dataset from a 118-node LTE-M connected, solar-powered air quality sensor network deployed across Chicago, Illinois, from April 2021 to April 2023. This dataset comprises 94,915,745 readings of United States EPA criteria air pollutants, in two parts: 1) 75,932,596 gas sensor readings for carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), and 2) 18,983,149 particulate matter (PM) readings. This open-access dataset uniquely enables researchers to examine critical aspects of smart city sensing, including environmental equity, sensor network deployment dynamics, and interactions between urban infrastructure, natural environments, and residents. Via integration with open datasets from the City of Chicago and other sources, this dataset serves as a foundational tool for advancing research in environmental justice, public health, and urban planning, empowering researchers to build and test ideas before going to deployment to move closer to achieving smart, sustainable urban environments.},

abstract = {In the field of virtual surgery simulation, high-precision, real-time soft body interaction simulation is crucial. The finite element method is currently one of the most accurate solutions in the simulation field. However, traditional explicit finite elements often suffer from low accuracy and high computational costs. This work presents a viscoelastic soft tissue simulation based on the implicit finite element approach and dynamic damping employing the Taichi framework to mimic soft tissue deformation. By increasing the stress of the Corotated linear elasticity model with SLM-based damping, the viscoelastic method lowers computational cost while nevertheless improving computational efficiency. Real-time high-frame-rate liver contact simulation is obtained by means of an effective collision approach based on Taichi framework, hence optimizing computational efficiency. Furthermore, force feedback devices help to replicate the needle puncturing and contacting with the liver more realistically. This approach shows viscoelastic characteristics, a realistic contact force sensation, and a frame rate of 110 FPS according to the stress-strain curve of the liver under needle-liver interaction and the force feedback curve. The results show that our approach may produce a more realistic experience during interactions with force feedback devices and achieve viscoelastic liver simulation with great computational efficiency.},

In this work, we propose DEDector, a low-cost, smartphone-based automated Non-Invasive Break-Up Time (NIBUT) measurement for DED screening. Utilizing a 3D-printed Placido ring attachment on a smartphone's camera, DEDector projects concentric rings onto the cornea, capturing a video for subsequent analysis using our proposed video processing pipeline to identify tear film stability. We conducted a real-world evaluation on 46 eyes, comparing DEDector with the traditional FBUT method. DEDector achieved a sensitivity of 77.78% and specificity of 82.14%, outperforming FBUT.},

abstract = {Privacy concerns over the security of personal information have grown in tandem with the spread of smartwatches. However, effective methods for protecting private data on smartwatches are very limited. Personal identity number (PIN) input is the only privacy protection method on off-the-shelf smartwatches, which requires tedious user effort. This is ineffective at securing information such as notifications and attention-grabbing alerts, which may leak personal data to passersby and adversaries, causing embarrassment or revealing sensitive communications. In this work, we propose a novel privacy protection system, TouchTone, that verifies users and secure personal data in a convenient and low-effort manner. Our system employs a challenge-response process to passively capture finger biometrics from an unobtrusive touch gesture using only microphones, speakers, and accelerometer sensors already built in smartwatches. To address smartwatch incompatibility with traditional high-frequency sensing techniques, we develop non-intrusive low-frequency challenge signals and cross-domain sensing techniques (i.e., measuring acoustic signals in the vibration domain) to capture robust and effective features specific to user fingers. A low-cost profile matching-based classifier is designed to enable stand-alone privacy protection on smartwatches. We conduct extensive experiments with 54 participants using varied hardware, environments, noise levels, user motions, and other impact factors, achieving around 97% true positive rate and 2% false positive rate in recognizing participants' identities for privacy protection.},

abstract = {To the distributed video coding approach, which focuses on fully or partially shifting the computational complexity from video encoder to the decoder, the simplicity and highly compact sampling in emerging compressive sensing appear to be very efficient tools. So, the distributed compressive video sensing (DCVS) has attracted much attention in the video coding community by applying constant high measurement rate (MR) for key frames sampling and constant low MR for non-key frames sampling. According to the use of constant and different MRs for the key and non-key frames sampling, severe and undesirable fluctuations in quality of reconstructed video frames is a common unresolved shortcoming in the DCVS, which negatively affects the users’ visual experience. To suppress sharp and undesirable quality fluctuations, group of picture (GOP)-level non-uniform MR allocation models are proposed in this article for the key and non-key frames at the encoder of the DCVS. This enhances visual quality without incurring noticeable computational cost to the encoder. A new multi-step reconstruction scheme is also proposed at the decoder exploiting spatial-temporal information in the reconstruction process with a tolerable computational complexity and remarkable reconstruction performance. It compensates for quality degradations, which may be caused by non-uniform MR allocation, to successive GOPs to reach high average quality and temporal smoothness of quality at the same time. Extensive experiments on different video sequences show that not only desirable high average reconstruction quality is maintained, but severe and undesirable quality fluctuations are also well suppressed. Hence, the users’ perceived quality is highly promoted, while the compression ratio does not exceed a certain target by restricting average MR to reach the target MR in the long term.},

First, spectral data of pesticide residues were collected using conventional substrates with various morphologies. Then, the sensor array is acquired using different fusion methods on the spectral data, specifically concatenation and parallel methods. Finally, the intelligent and precise detection of chlormequat chloride and paraquat is implemented in a regression model constructed through the sensor array combined with machine learning and deep learning. In this experiment, the lowest detection limits for chlormequat chloride and paraquat detected are 0.03 mg/L and 0.003 mg/L, respectively. The regression model which was constructed using the sensor arrays obtained from the concatenation fusion method combined with the MobileNet obtained the best prediction results, with the coefficients of determination of prediction of 0.9865 and 0.9846 for chlormequat chloride and paraquat, and root-mean-square errors of prediction of 0.2254 and 0.0174, respectively. Overall, the method we proposed achieves rapid, intelligent and accurate detection of chlormequat chloride and paraquat, with the advantages of low cost and simple operation, which has great application potential in trace detection of pesticide residues.},

abstract = {Drones which can swarm and loiter in a certain area cost hundreds of dollars, but mosquitos can do the same and are essentially worthless. To control swarms of low-cost robots, researchers may end up spending countless hours brainstorming robot configurations and policies to "organically" create behaviors which do not need expensive sensors and perception. Existing research explores the possible emergent behaviors in swarms of robots with only a binary sensor and a simple but hand-picked controller structure. Even agents in this highly limited sensing, actuation, and computational capability class can exhibit relatively complex global behaviors such as aggregation, milling, and dispersal, but finding the local interaction rules that enable more collective behaviors remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the feasibility of training spiking neural networks to find those local interaction rules that result in particular emergent behaviors. In this paper, we focus on simulating a specific milling behavior already known to be producible using very simple binary sensing and acting agents. To do this, we use evolutionary algorithms to evolve not only the parameters (the weights, biases, and delays) of a spiking neural network, but also its structure. To create a baseline, we also show an evolutionary search strategy over the parameters for the incumbent hand-picked binary controller structure. Our simulations show that spiking neural networks can be evolved in binary sensing agents to form a mill.},

Simpler devices have many drawbacks: Low sampling rate, for energy efficiency and little support are some drawbacks. More advanced devices have a high-frequent sampling rate of sensor data. These however, have a higher price and a limited support time. Our work introduces an open-source app for cost-effective, high-frequent, and long-term recording of sensor data. We based the development on the Bangle.js 2, which is a prevalent open-source smartwatch. The code has been optimised for efficiency, using sensor-specific properties to store sensor data in a compressed, loss-less, and time-stamped form to the local NAND-storage. We show in our experiments that we have the ability to record PPG-data at 50 Hertz for at least half a day. With other configurations we can record multiple sensors with a high-frequent update interval for a full day.},

abstract = {We propose UltraCLR, a new contrastive learning framework that fuses dual modulation ultrasonic sensing signals to enhance gesture representation. Most existing ultrasound-based gesture recognition tasks rely on a large amount of manually labeled samples to learn task-specific representations via end-to-end training. However, they cannot exploit unlabeled continuous gesture signals that are easy to collect. Inspired by recent self-supervised learning techniques, UltraCLR aims to autonomously learn a ubiquitous gesture signal representation that can benefit all tasks from low-cost unlabeled signals. We use the STFT heatmap as a secondary input and leverage the contrastive learning framework to improve the high-quality Channel Impulsive Response heatmap input representations. The learned representations can better represent the spatial-position information and intermediate states of gesture movement. With the representation learned by UltraCLR, we can greatly reduce the complexity of downstream gesture recognition tasks so that they can be completed using a simple classifier trained with a small training set and a lower computational cost. Our experimental results show that UltraCLR outperforms state-of-the-art gesture recognition systems with only a few labeled samples and achieves more than 85% reduction in computational complexity and over 9\texttimes{} improvement in inference speed.},

abstract = {Continual learning (CL) trains NN models incrementally from a continuous stream of tasks. To remember previously learned knowledge, prior studies store old samples over a memory hierarchy and replay them when new tasks arrive. Edge devices that adopt CL to preserve data privacy are typically energy-sensitive and thus require high model accuracy while not compromising energy efficiency, i.e., cost-effectiveness. Our work is the first to explore the design space of hierarchical memory replay-based CL to gain insights into achieving cost-effectiveness on edge devices. We present Miro, a novel system runtime that carefully integrates our insights into the CL framework by enabling it to dynamically configure the CL system based on resource states for the best cost-effectiveness. To reach this goal, Miro also performs online profiling on parameters with clear accuracy-energy trade-offs and adapts to optimal values with low overhead. Extensive evaluations show that Miro significantly outperforms baseline systems we build for comparison, consistently achieving higher cost-effectiveness.},

abstract = {To improve the understanding of air pollution exposure and to predict future air quality trends, the demand for low-cost sensor-based air quality gird monitoring is growing gradually. In this study, a low-cost multi-parameter air quality monitoring system (LCS) based on back propagation (BP) neural network algorithm is proposed. The system can measure particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5 μm and 10 μm (PM2.5 and PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O3) simultaneously. The multi-dimensional multi-response prediction models based on a 20-20-type-hidden-layer BP neural network algorithm are proposed by taking the original signals of the sensors as input and measurements of the reference instrumentations as output. The experimental results show that the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) in μg/m3 of PM2.5 and PM10 measured between reference monitor and the BP-model algorithm based LCS are 16.90 μg/m3 and 30.69 μg/m3, respectively. The corresponding determination coefficients R2 separately are 0.8145 and 0.9042. The RMSEs in μg/m3 of SO2, NO2, CO and O3 between reference instrument and BP-model-based LCS results are 3.89 μg/m3, 11.36 μg/m3, 160 μg/m3 and 16.52 μg/m3, respectively. The determination coefficients R2 separately are 0.3467, 0.6980, 0.7653 and 0.8939.},

Traditional diagnostic methods mainly rely on clinical symptoms and imaging examinations, which have relatively low sensitivity. This study combines Raman spectroscopy technology with machine learning to classify serum samples from osteoarthritis patients and healthy controls. A total of 109 samples from osteoarthritis patients and 32 samples from healthy controls were collected. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was first used for feature extraction, followed by the construction of classification models using algorithms such as Adaboost, Catboost, XGBoost, and Bagging, with dynamic model selection for fusion to enhance the generalization ability of the models. To address data imbalance, the study also introduced a misclassification cost-sensitive strategy and SMOTE oversampling technique. The results showed that the accuracy of the fused model reached 98.81%, validating the effectiveness of this method in medical diagnosis. This research provides a new approach for non-invasive, rapid, and accurate diagnosis of osteoarthritis and serves as a reference for intelligent diagnosis of other diseases.},

Our system combines smart insoles and wearable motion tracking sensors with immersive displays to provide the patient with real-time feedback about their gait within an engaging training environment. We conducted two studies that compared various system environments and gait visualizations to inform optimal system usability and user experience. Our findings demonstrate that the level of immersion is a critical factor for user engagement in biofeedback-driven gait training, with immersive VR significantly outperforming mobile AR and non-immersive screen-based displays and participants found the real-time visualizations and feedback very useful, with a preference for the full lower body visualization.

abstract = {Video Individual Counting (VIC), which seeks to count unique individuals across video sequences without duplication, has broader applications than traditional Video Crowd Counting (VCC), including urban planning, event management, and safety monitoring. However, although current VIC approaches have demonstrated strong capabilities, their reliance on identity-level or group-level annotations necessitates substantial labeling effort and expense. To reduce the high costs of manual annotation, we introduce VIC-SSL, a novel self-supervised learning approach that utilizes unlabeled data along with the innovative feature-level augmentation technique called Foreground-driven ShiftMix (F-ShiftMix). By blending and shifting in the feature space rather than the image space, F-ShiftMix generates realistic crowd motion without explicit annotations, while preserving global semantic coherence. Furthermore, VIC-SSL integrates the Cost-guided Flow Prompt (CFP) and the Distinction-aware Cross-Attention (DCA) to enhance flow-aware localization and inter-frame correspondence learning. Our extensive experiments across three datasets, including SenseCrowd, CroHD, and CARLA, demonstrate that VIC-SSL substantially outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly reduced data requirements. These results showcase VIC-SSL's potential to dramatically lower annotation costs and improve the deployment feasibility of VIC systems in complex scenarios.

abstract = {Among existing schemes for soft error resilience, acoustic-sensor-based detection stands out owing to its ability to prevent silent data corruption at low hardware cost. However, the state-of-the-art work not only incurs a considerable run-time overhead but also complicates the processor pipeline with intrusive microarchitectural modifications, hindering its practical deployment in real silicon. To this end, this paper presents VeriPipe, a near-zero-cost compiler/architecture codesign scheme for soft error resilience. VeriPipe compiler partitions input program to a series of regions (epochs) statically, while VeriPipe hardware verifies if they are error-free dynamically. In particular, VeriPipe achieves a simple yet efficient region-level verification where each region goes through a three-stage (Execute, Verify, and Commit) verification pipeline to ensure the absence of soft errors before proceeding to the next region. In particular, VeriPipe hardware overlaps the Verify stage of each region with the Execute stage of the next region, thereby effectively hiding the Verify delay. Experiments with 43 applications from SPEC2006/2017/NPB-CPP/SPLASH3/DoE Mini-Apps highlight the negligible overheads of VeriPipe, i.e., an average of 1% run-time overhead and a storage overhead of only 3 registers and 1 countdown timer.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) works have demonstrated the robust capabilities of Shallow Autoencoders on implicit feedback, showcasing highly competitive performance with other reasonable approaches (e.g., iALS and VAE-CF). However, despite their dual advantages of high performance and simple construction, EASE still exhibits several major shortcomings that must be addressed. To be more precise, the scalability of EASE is limited by the number of items, which determines the storage and inversion cost of a large dense matrix; the square-loss optimization objective does not consistently meet the recommendation task’s requirement for predicting personalized rankings, resulting in suboptimal outcomes; the regularization coefficients are sensitive and require recalibration with different datasets, leading to an exhaustive and time-consuming fine-tuning process. In order to address these obstacles, we propose a novel approach called Similarity-Structure Aware Shallow Autoencoder (AutoS (^2) AE) that aims to enhance both recommendation accuracy and model efficiency. Our method introduces three similarity structures: Co-occurrence, KNN, and NSW graphs, which replace the large dense matrix in EASE with a sparse structure, thus facilitating model compression. Additionally, we optimize the model by incorporating a low-rank training component into the matrix and applying a weighted square loss for improved ranking-oriented approximations. To automatically tune the hyperparameters, we further design two validation losses on the validation set for guidance and update the hyperparameters using the gradients of these validation losses. Both theoretical analyses regarding the introduction of similarity structures and empirical evaluations on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which significantly outperforms competing baselines.},

In this paper, we describe the development of a low-cost binaural audio system capable of interpreting the acoustic information present in an environment to assist a lidar system in making decisions that need to be made by a mobile robot. By taking advantage of the robot’s mobility, the system can resolve the uncertainties inherent in consciously choosing two off-the-shelf microphones and effectively realize 360-degree coverage.

abstract = {In recent years, the problem of icing on power transmission lines caused by extreme weather has become increasingly serious. Traditional manual inspections are inefficient, costly, and pose safety risks. An intelligent, high-precision integrated inspection and deicing solution is urgently needed. To address this problem, this study proposes an intelligent inspection and deicing system for power transmission lines based on an unmanned aerial vehicle platform. First, a multimodal sensor fusion unmanned aerial vehicle inspection platform is designed, integrating a high-resolution visible light camera, an infrared thermal imager, and a lidar. Secondly, an icing target detection model is constructed based on the improved YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once version 5) algorithm, and a transfer learning strategy is introduced to optimize the pre-training weights to improve the recognition accuracy of icing thickness and position. Finally, a modular deicing device is designed, using a lightweight robotic arm equipped with a high-frequency ultrasonic and microwave composite deicing unit to achieve efficient deicing and energy consumption control. The experimental results show that the system based on the YOLOv5 algorithm can stably identify ice layers in complex environments, especially in ice layers of different thicknesses (1mm to 15mm), with a detection accuracy of 92.3%, which is better than the accuracy of YOLOv4 and Faster R-CNN. In terms of deicing efficiency, the microwave composite deicing technology has low energy consumption while ensuring efficient deicing, and has a good cost-effectiveness. The maximum deicing efficiency reaches 7.5 kg/min and the energy consumption is 42.5 Wh. Comprehensive evaluation shows that the operating efficiency and stability of the proposed system in extreme weather conditions have been significantly improved, providing an efficient and reliable solution for intelligent inspection and deicing of transmission lines.},

abstract = {The forward-forward algorithm is a recently introduced method that can be used to train artificial neural networks. Currently, the canonical approach to training artificial neural networks is using (batched) stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation to minimize a carefully designed cost function. As successful as it may be in realizing artificial neural networks on modern digital computers, the backpropagation algorithm is biologically implausible. Unlike backpropagation, the forward-forward algorithm does not propagate the partial derivatives of the cost function backwards throughout the whole network and does not require storing or re-computing layer activations. As a result, the forward-forward algorithm is closer to being biologically plausible. As mentioned in Hinton's original paper, the forward-forward algorithm is well-suited for low-power platforms, indicating the possibility of on-device/on-edge training. Coincidentally, event-based (neuromorphic) visual sensors, praised for their power efficiency and high dynamic range, are becoming increasingly commercially available. In this paper we apply the forward-forward algorithm to train relatively small network models to classify event-based visual inputs. We first implement the forward-forward algorithm to reproduce the results obtained with the MNIST dataset in the original paper. Next, we switch the input data to the event-based version of the MNIST dataset and propose novel modifications to the forward-forward training process to make it applicable to event-based visual inputs. Finally, we present a comparative performance analysis.

abstract = {Large-scale IoT sensor deployment calls for inexpensive, low-power sensor nodes that still perform long-range, large-scale networking at the system level. However, current sensor nodes are constructed according to the `one-size-fits-all' embedded design, where the processor and RF transceiver are indispensable but underutilized in low-duty cycles, resulting in overwhelmingly significant unit price and run-time power. In this paper, we propose a novel processor-sharing IoT architecture that converts the vast majority of sensor nodes from embedded computers to low-end RF peripherals. The conventional full-fledged sensor nodes are smashed into the air, and the scattered chips are scaled well with negligible overheads through a virtual I2C bus called RFBus. Specifically, the RFBus interface is designed to be backward compatible with the I2C bus interface, and thus, the RFBus network inherits versatile link layer services transparently from the well-established I2C link layer protocol. We design the RFBus with a joint consideration of system-level performance and deployment costs and evaluate the prototypes in indoor and outdoor scenarios. The result indicates that the proposed architecture achieves 6.09 x (indoor) and 6.69 x (outdoor) energy saving and reduces the unit price of sensor nodes by 23.5% (indoor) and 33.5% (outdoor).},

abstract = {Providing acceptable video quality in the Internet of Things (IoT) implementation poses a significant challenge, mainly when the application is performed on low-cost and low-power devices. This research focuses on developing a frame resolution adjustment system that maintains the frame rate value of video delivery in wireless IoT environments with resource-constrained devices. Consistent frame rates prevent motion lag and data loss, improving user experience. The system works by predicting the upcoming throughput values using machine learning methods to adjust the sensing parameter, which is the resolution of the video frame to be captured by camera nodes. Hence, the proposed system is equipped with a file size estimator to estimate the size of the next video frame and then adjust the resolution in accordance with the throughput prediction. In this research, we conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the accuracy of the file size estimator and the throughput prediction. The experiment generated a dataset to evaluate throughput prediction and file size estimator model. The evaluation results for the file size estimator showed a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 6.73% in the experiment using 317 frames with video resolutions between 72p and 720p. Experiments were also conducted to compare several machine learning methods for predicting throughput values. Compared to long short-term memory (LSTM) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), simple exponential smoothing (SES) outperforms the others with the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) values. Building upon these findings, we implemented the frame resolution adjustment system using SES as the method for predicting the upcoming throughput values. Finally, we demonstrated that the proposed system can maintain the frame rate according to the threshold set by the system while the resolution is being maximized, thereby addressing the challenges of maintaining video quality in resource-constrained IoT environments.},

abstract = {Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is powering Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM), which is changing healthcare by letting data be collected, analysed, and decisions made in real time. This essay looks at how IoT-based RPM systems improve care for patients, lower the number of times they have to go back to the hospital, and make the best use of healthcare resources. RPM systems constantly check important health indicators like heart rate, blood pressure, glucose levels, and oxygen saturation by using personal sensors, smart devices, and cloud computing. They send real-time data to healthcare providers. A lot of data about patients is processed by advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms find insights that can be used to take action and predict possible health risks before they become problems. The study focusses on how edge and fog computing can help ensure low-latency data handling, which makes the system more reliable and efficient. Blockchain technology and standardised standards help solve problems like data security, portability, and scaling. This makes patient data more private and helps systems work together better. Case studies show that RPM works well for controlling chronic diseases, recovering from surgery, and caring for the old, showing big changes in patient results and cost saves. In addition, using AI allows for predictive analytics, which makes treatment plans more personalised and gives doctors the power to make decisions based on data.},

abstract = {We consider the partitioning of a deep neural network (DNN) inference job and offloading part of it from a resource-constrained device to a resource-rich server. The inference job is required to finish within a delay constraint, but it is allowed to perform early exit at some intermediate layer of the DNN, at the cost of lower accuracy. Since in practice both the processing delay and the communication delay of offloading usually are unknown ahead of time, this is naturally modelled as an online delay-constrained accuracy maximization problem. We propose Accuracy-Optimal Delay Constrained Online Partitioning (AODPart), a lightweight online algorithm that uses an adaptive thresholding strategy to solve the offloading problem. We derive the competitive ratio for AODPart and show that it is optimal in the sense that no other online algorithm can achieve a lower deterministic competitive ratio. Furthermore, we show that AODPart is robust and provides worst-case performance guarantee even with parameter estimation error. Through experimenting with common vision and language learning models, we demonstrate that AODPart substantially outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives and returns near optimal accuracy in practice.},

abstract = {We consider two natural variants of the problem of minimum spanning tree (MST) of a graph in the parallel setting: MST verification (verifying if a given tree is an MST) and the sensitivity analysis of an MST (finding the lowest cost replacement edge for each edge of the MST). These two problems have been studied extensively for sequential algorithms and for parallel algorithms in the PRAM model of computation. In this paper, we extend the study to the standard model of Massive Parallel Computation (MPC).It is known that for graphs of diameter D, the connectivity problem can be solved in O(log D + log log n) rounds on an MPC with low local memory (each machine can store only O(nδ ) words for an arbitrary constant δ &gt; 0) and with linear global memory, that is, with optimal utilization. However, for the related task of finding an MST, we need Ω(log DMST ) rounds, where DMST denotes the diameter of the minimum spanning tree. The state of the art upper bound for MST is O(log n) rounds; the result follows by simulating existing PRAM algorithms. While this bound may be optimal for general graphs, the benchmark of connectivity and lower bound for MST suggest the target bound of O(log DMST ) rounds, or possibly O(log DMST + log log n) rounds. As for now, we do not know if this bound is achievable for the MST problem on an MPC with low local memory and linear global memory. In this paper, we show that MST verification and sensitivity analysis of an MST can be completed in O(log DT) rounds on an MPC with low local memory and with linear global memory, that is, with optimal utilization; here DT is the diameter of the input "candidate MST" T. The algorithms asymptotically match our lower bound, conditioned on the 1-vs-2-cycle conjecture.},

abstract = {Recently, due to the continued reduction in DNA sequencing cost, large-scale genetic samples are being gathered for accelerating predispositions to specific diseases, tailoring treatment of efficient drugs and therapies, and the like. Massive genetic samples are encrypted-and-then-delegated to a public cloud to both save investment and maintenance costs and prevent the potential leakage of sensitive information. However, such a manner compromises the serviceability of a public cloud, since encryption inevitably breaks the semantic information of genetic samples. Secure count query of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as a kernel component for GWASs and related genomic analysis, is attracting much more attention.Existing methods lack provable security, suffer low efficiency caused by multiple interactions with the cloud, and so on. In this paper, a secure virtual CT-Tree (secure vCT-Tree) is carefully constructed to confuse the tree structure by introducing a hash function and a Paillier system. Furthermore, by delegating the secure vCT-Tree to the cloud, concrete models (i.e., SecCT and SecCT+) are presented to resolve secure count query problems on the fly. SecCT+ is a solution based on trusted execution environment while SecCT is a pure software solution. Both models advance the provable security of genetic research and are proven to be secure under the adaptive chosen keyword (query) attack (IND-CKA2) model. Furthermore, massive experiments are evaluated on realistic data to show the superiority of SecCT and SecCT+.},

abstract = {Serverless computing platforms rely on fast container initialization to provide low latency and high throughput for requests. While hardware enforced trusted execution environments (TEEs) have gained popularity, confidential computing has yet to be widely adopted by latency-sensitive platforms due to its additional initialization overhead. We investigate the application of AMD's Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) to microVMs and find that current startup times for confidential VMs are prohibitively slow due to the high cost of establishing a root of trust for each new VM.We present SEVeriFast, a new bootstrap scheme for SEV VMs that reevaluates current microVM techniques for fast boot, such as eliminating bootstrap stages and bypassing guest kernel decompression. Counter-intuitively, we find that introducing an additional bootstrap component and reintroducing kernel compression optimizes the cold boot performance of SEV microVMs by reducing the cost of measurement on the critical boot path and producing a minimal root of trust. To our knowledge, SEVeriFast is the first work to explore the trade-offs associated with booting confidential microVMs and provide a set of guiding principles as a step toward confidential serverless. We show that SEVeriFast improves cold start performance of SEV VMs over current methods by 86-93%.},

abstract = {Sensors enable us to digitally capture stimuli like moisture, light, and force. Despite their low cost, reliability, and scalability, the lack of widespread adoption of IoT has hindered the realization of true ubiquitous sensing. A likely reason is that the current sensor platforms are bulky due to the batteries and complex electronics needed to interface sensors communication systems. In this work, we present a fully-passive, miniaturized, flexible form factor sensor interface titled ZenseTag that uses minimal electronics to read and communicate analog sensor data, directly at radio frequencies (RF). We exploit the fundamental principle of resonance, where a sensor's terminal impedance becomes most sensitive to the measured stimulus at its resonant frequency. This enables ZenseTag to read out the sensor variation using only energy harvested from wireless signals. We demonstrate its implementation with a 15x10mm flexible PCB that connects sensors to a printed antenna and passive RFID ICs, enabling near real-time readout through a performant GUI-enabled software.We showcase ZenseTag's versatility by interfacing commercial force, soil moisture and photodiode sensors [1--3]. Further, we motivate dedicated application studies for these sensors.},

abstract = {Food waste is one of the greatest economic and ethical challenges in the world. Empowering consumers with the ability to assess the quality of fruit can be a game changer for reducing waste and motivating a healthier diet. In this paper, we present Meta-Sticker a novel low-cost non-invasive solution for accurate fruit sensing via a sub-THz metamaterial sticker. The key idea is to exploit fruit as a substrate for resonating meta-atoms. Changes in the chemical composite of the fruit over time (e.g., sugar and water concentration) yield variation in the dielectric properties of the fruit (here substrate). Interestingly, this would affect the resonant frequency of the Meta-Sticker. We design Meta-Sticker to resonate in the sub-THz bands for their sensitivity to water, mm-scale penetration depth, and non-ionizing features that offer high-resolution inferences from the inner pulp of the fruit. We develop a model that translates the resonance of Meta-Sticker to well-known ripeness metrics, namely Dry Matter and Brix. We fabricate Meta-Sticker on paper and conduct extensive over-the-air experiments. We demonstrate that our system can estimate Brix and Dry Matter in three different types of fruits with an average Normalized RMSE value of 1.24%, an error that yields a negligible impact on taste and is imperceptible by the consumer. Our design is non-invasive, low-cost (less than a cent), passive, biodegradable, and conformal.},

In this paper, we propose a novel ring-shaped virtual keyboard system named RingVKB for convenient text input using low-cost IMUs available on any wearables. At the core of RingVKB are two novel designs: 1) A circular keyboard layout with 12 equal sectors, which assembles all common keys on classical keyboards while allowing users to type with only one finger effectively, and 2) an error control algorithm that calculates the relative displacement of keystrokes from the noisy IMU sensor data. The two components, coupled together, enable high-accuracy and efficient text input for ubiquitous scenarios.We implement RingVKB using a small device consisting of a microcontroller and a MEMS sensor, which can be attached to the user's index finger.Experimental results show that RingVKB can effectively improve the relative displacement estimation accuracy, and achieves an overall keystroke recognition accuracy of 93% for 25 key positions. A user study also shows that RingVKB is easy to learn and use. Using only low-cost IMU sensors, RingVKB provides a virtual keyboard solution that can be widely adopted on wearables.},

abstract = {Low motion-to-photon latencies between physical movement and rendering updates are crucial for an immersive virtual reality (VR) experience and to avoidusers’ discomfort and sickness. Current methods aim to minimize the delay between the motion measurement and rendering at the cost of increasing technical complexity and possibly decreasing accuracy. By relying on capturing physical motion, these strategies will, by nature, not result in zero latency rendering or will be based on prediction and resulting uncertainty. This paper presents and evaluates a novel alternative and proof of principle for VR motion tracking that could enable motion-to-photon latencies of zero and below zero in time. We termed our concept Neural Motion Tracking, which we define as the sensing and assessment of motion through human neural activation of the somatic nervous system. In contrast to measuring physical activity, the key principle is that we aim to utilize the physiological timeframe between a user’s intention and the execution of motion. We aim to foresee upcoming motion ahead of the physical movement, by sampling preceding electromyographic signals before the muscle activation. The electromechanical delay (EMD) between potential change in the muscle activation and actual physical movement opens a gap in which measurement can be taken and evaluated before the physical motion. In a first proof of principle, we evaluated the concept with two activities, arm bending and head rotation, measured with a binary activation measure. Our results indicate that it is possible to predict movement and update a rendering up to 2&nbsp;ms before its physical execution, which is assessed by optical tracking after approximately 4&nbsp;ms. However, to make the best use of this advantage, electromyography (EMG) sensor data should be as high quality as possible (i.e., low noise and from muscle-near electrodes). Our results empirically quantify this characteristic for the first time when compared to state-of-the-art optical tracking systems for VR. We discuss our results and potential pathways to motivate further work toward marker- and latency-less motion tracking.},

abstract = {Soil moisture level sensing is essential for enabling smart irrigation, which is crucial for our food security and sustainable agriculture. Existing soil moisture sensing systems face limitations such as single-layer sensing, limited depth, power supply reliance, and complex calibration. In addition, costly and cumbersome sensor unit design hinders mass and dense deployment of passive intelligence. This paper introduces MetaSoil, a soil moisture sensing system that is calibration-free, continuous, and multi-layered, leveraging a passive 3D printable mmWave metamaterial. When soil moisture level changes, our hydrogel patched polylactic acid (PLA) metamaterial alters resonant frequency in the impinging mmWave signals due to impedance match offset. Our system eliminates in-soil power supply dependencies by utilizing the RF resonance of 3D-printed metamaterial, allowing for deeper placement, and simultaneous multi-layer sensing. We then integrate a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) mmWave radar to query the metamaterial sensor. With MetaSoil's fully passive metamaterial pole, RF signal from far is redirected towards the sensor unit, bypassing soil's heavy attenuation effect. Through our extensive evaluation, MetaSoil achieves 98.9 % accuracy with ±10% moisture level precision in single-layered sensing, at depth of 1m meter. It achieves 98.8 % accuracy with ±10% in double layered sensing at same depth with 10cm sensor spacing. We further examine the robustness of our system with real-world requirements. Overall, MetaSoil represents a low-cost, durable, and easily deployable solution that supports remote and continuous soil moisture monitoring, advancing the scalability and effectiveness of smart agricultural practices.},

abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring has been widely explored in detecting and diagnosing cardiovascular diseases due to its accuracy, simplicity, and sensitivity. However, medical- or commercial-grade ECG monitoring devices can be costly for people who want to monitor their ECG on a daily basis. These devices typically require several electrodes to be attached to the human body which is inconvenient for continuous monitoring. To enable low-cost measurement of ECG signals with off-the-shelf devices on a daily basis, in this paper, we propose a novel ECG sensing system that uses acceleration data collected from a smartphone. Our system offers several advantages over previous systems, including low cost, ease of use, location and user independence, and high accuracy. We design a two-tiered denoising process, comprising SWT and Soft-Thresholding, to effectively eliminate interference caused by respiration, body, and hand movements. Finally, we develop a multi-level deep learning recovery model to achieve efficient, real-time and user-independent ECG measurement on commercial mobile phones. We conduct extensive experiments with 30 participants (with nearly 36,000 heartbeat samples) under a user-independent scenario. The average errors of the PR interval, QRS interval, QT interval, and RR interval are 12.02 ms, 16.9 ms, 16.64 ms, and 1.84 ms, respectively. As a case study, we also demonstrate the strong capability of our system in signal recovery for patients with common heart diseases, including tachycardia, bradycardia, arrhythmia, unstable angina, and myocardial infarction.},

abstract = {The rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) have raised public concerns about the privacy leakage of personally identifiable information (PII) within their extensive training datasets. Recent studies have demonstrated that an adversary could extract highly sensitive privacy data from the training data of LLMs with carefully designed prompts. However, these attacks suffer from the model's tendency to hallucinate and catastrophic forgetting (CF) in the pre-training stage, rendering the veracity of divulged PIIs negligible. In our research, we propose a novel attack, Janus, which exploits the fine-tuning interface to recover forgotten PIIs from the pre-training data in LLMs. We formalize the privacy leakage problem in LLMs and explain why forgotten PIIs can be recovered through empirical analysis on open-source language models. Based upon these insights, we evaluate the performance of Janus on both open-source language models and two latest LLMs, i.e., GPT-3.5-Turbo and LLaMA-2-7b. Our experiment results show that Janus amplifies the privacy risks by over 10 times in comparison with the baseline and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art privacy extraction attacks including prefix attacks and in-context learning (ICL). Furthermore, our analysis validates that existing fine-tuning APIs provided by OpenAI and Azure AI Studio are susceptible to our Janus attack, allowing an adversary to conduct such an attack at a low cost.},

abstract = {In autonomous driving, millimeter wave (mmWave) radar has been widely adopted for object detection because of its robustness and reliability under various weather and lighting conditions. For radar object detection, deep neural networks (DNNs) are becoming increasingly important because they are more robust and accurate, and can provide rich semantic information about the detected objects, which is critical for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to make decisions. However, recent studies have shown that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Despite the rapid development of DNN-based radar object detection models, there have been no studies on their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Although some spoofing attack methods are proposed to attack the radar sensor by actively transmitting specific signals using some special devices, these attacks require sub-nanosecond-level synchronization between the devices and the radar and are very costly, which limits their practicability in real world. In addition, these attack methods can not effectively attack DNN-based radar object detection. To address the above problems, in this paper, we investigate the possibility of using a few adversarial objects to attack the DNN-based radar object detection models through passive reflection. These objects can be easily fabricated using 3D printing and metal foils at low cost. By placing these adversarial objects at some specific locations on a target vehicle, we can easily fool the victim AV's radar object detection model. The experimental results demonstrate that the attacker can achieve the attack goal by using only two adversarial objects and conceal them as car signs, which have good stealthiness and flexibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the passive-reflection-based attacks against the DNN-based radar object detection models using low-cost, readily-available and easily concealable geometric shaped objects.},

abstract = {Compressed sensing is a signal processing technique used to efficiently acquire and reconstruct signals across various fields, including science, engineering, and business. A critical research challenge in compressed sensing is constructing a sensing matrix with desirable reconstruction properties. For optimal performance, the reconstruction process requires the sensing matrix to have low coherence. Several methods have been proposed to create deterministic sensing matrices. We propose a new statistical method to construct deterministic sensing matrices by intelligently sampling rows of Walsh-Hadamard matrices. Compared to existing methods, our approach yields sensing matrices with lower coherence, accommodates a more flexible number of measurements, and entails lower computational cost.},

abstract = {Even though significant progress has been made in standardizing document layout analysis, complex layout documents like magazines and newspapers still present challenges. Models trained on standardized documents struggle with these complexities, and the high cost of annotating such documents limits dataset availability. To address this, we propose the Complex Layout Document Image Generation (DIG) model, which can generate diverse document images with complex layouts and authentic-looking text, aiding in layout analysis model training. Concretely, we first pre-train DIG on a large-scale document dataset with a text-sensitive loss function to address the issue of unreal generation of text regions. Then, we fine-tune it with a small number of documents with complex layouts to generate new images with the same layout. Additionally, we use a layout generation model to create new layouts, enhancing data diversity. Finally, we design a box-wise quality scoring function to filter out low-quality regions during layout analysis model training to enhance the effectiveness of using the generated images. Experimental results on the DSSE-200 and PRImA datasets show when incorporating generated images from DIG, the mAP of the layout analysis model is improved from 47.05 to 56.07 and from 53.80 to 62.26, respectively, which is a 19.17% and 15.72% enhancement compared to the baseline.},

In this paper, we propose a low-cost novel power monitoring approach that uses only one sensor to extract power consumption information of all servers. We utilize the conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI) of server power supplies to measure their power consumption from non-intrusive single-point voltage measurements. We present a theoretical characterization of conducted EMI generation in server power supply and its propagation through the data center power network. Using a set of ten commercial-grade servers (six Dell PowerEdge and four Lenovo ThinkSystem), we demonstrate that our approach can estimate each server's power consumption with less than ~7% mean absolute error.},

This can detect stress from varying Heart Rates, validated by expensive commercial wearables. Between subject experiments on drivers (total n = 14 in two phases) with wearables, we also found that road factors are responsible for driving stress.

It is a key capability for emerging applications like robotic surgery and assistive robotics. Existing solutions to tactile perception typically rely on computation-intensive deep neural networks, which require high-performance computing resources unavailable on embedded and battery-powered devices. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising, energy-efficient alternative, but their practical adoption remains limited due to the lack of efficient and deployable neuromorphic solutions. We present SpikeTouch, a software framework designed to reduce the computational overhead of SNNs for tactile perception on neuromorphic hardware. SpikeTouch offers three key optimizations tailed to SNN-based tactile perception: (1) a spike encoding scheme that balances precision and computational cost; (2) a systematic method for extracting multidimensional tactile features; and (3) a training strategy that minimizes quantization errors to improve performance and reduce memory usage. We evaluate SpikeTouch on the Tianjic neuromorphic chip using representative tactile perception workloads. Our results show that SpikeTouch achieves high recognition accuracy for 30 objects and their material stiffness, with an average accuracy of 92.92% and 92.35%, respectively. It is also highly energy and computationally efficient, operating at just 1 Watt of power - significantly lower than the hundreds or thousands of Watts typically required by a GPU - and delivering a response in under 20 ms - well below the average human reflex time of over 100 ms.},

SixFeet consists of interactive LED stations that are equipped with proximity sensors that record the presence of a player. It uses this information to steer players along safe running paths on the playing field. We designed training exercises for SixFeet that embody relevant sport-specific skills. We did this in the context of field hockey. In a use study, we investigated the technical performance and user experience of SixFeet. Results show that participants kept a safe social distance; that SixFeet-exercises were significantly more enjoyable than ‘traditional’ corona-safe exercises and that SixFeet-enabled exercises better supported the training of sport-specific skills than ‘traditional’ corona-safe exercises. With this study, we show how a simple low-cost tool can be designed and implemented to support the training of sport-specific skills, especially in pandemic times.},

However, these mobile LCSs suffer from measurement drifting in real-world scenarios, necessitating a post-deployment real-time calibration. Unfortunately, the limited availability of urban real reference stations (RRS) restricts the calibration opportunities for LCSs. This paper proposes a non-rendezvous method that addresses this challenge by establishing virtual reference stations (VRS), which offer additional calibration opportunities for LCSs. Through the air pollution field reconstruction, the readings of VRSs are inferred from RRSs’ data. Furthermore, a confidence assessment mechanism is developed to quantify the uncertainty of established VRSs. Finally, a field experiment is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showcasing a 25% improvement over the advanced baseline.},

abstract = {Device drivers are a prominent source of operating system bugs and vulnerabilities, due to market pressures on hardware vendors and access to privileged system resources. OSes increasingly deprivilege drivers by moving them out of the kernel into user space, but this is widely understood to come with significant overhead. The perfect storm concerns GPU drivers, which are very large, complex and yet highly performance-sensitive. For performance reasons, large parts of these drivers run with full kernel privileges on major OSes. We deprivilege a GPU driver by moving it to user space. To avoid context-switching latency we run interrupt handlers inside eBPF sandboxes. Additionally, we take away the ability of the GPU driver to manage its own page tables and move this into an OS-vendor-vetted component. We create two variants. Firstly, a microkernel-inspired implementation which runs the driver in a standard Unix process. Secondly, we move the driver into a CHERI compartment. CHERI allows isolation of distrusting code in sandboxes without needing MMU-based separation. Compartments safely coexist within an address space, but efficiently share data by passing CHERI capabilities between each other, and incur reduced context-switching costs. To do this we use 'co-located processes', an existing framework which allows us to run graphics drivers and their applications as separate OS processes in a shared address space. Microkernel-like user-space drivers are still often believed to have high overheads, yet our Unix process-based implementation increases execution time on average by only 7.9% (geometric mean of the benchmark suite; max. 48.2%, min. 0.1%) for GPGPU and by 5.5% (max. 12.6%, min. -0.2%) for graphics workloads, while providing major security benefits. Despite these low costs, isolating processes with CHERI compartments, instead of address spaces, reduces average overheads to 6% (max. 36.6%, min. -0.2%) and 5% (max. 11.2%, min. 0.01%) respectively.},

Our solution leverages the fact that a sonic toothbrush produces rich acoustic signals when in contact with teeth, which contain important information about each tooth's status. ToMoBrush extracts tooth resonance signatures from the acoustic signals to characterize the dental condition of each tooth. We further develop a data-driven signal processing pipeline to detect and discriminate different dental conditions. We evaluate ToMoBrush on 19 participants and dental-standard models for detecting common dental problems including caries, calculus, and food impaction, achieving a detection ROC-AUC of 0.90, 0.83, and 0.88 respectively. Interviews with dental experts further validate ToMoBrush's potential in enhancing at-home dental healthcare.},

abstract = {Tiny object detection plays a vital role in drone surveillance, remote sensing, and autonomous systems, enabling the identification of small targets across vast landscapes. However, existing methods suffer from inefficient feature leverage and high computational costs due to redundant feature processing and rigid query allocation. To address these challenges, we propose Dome-DETR, a novel framework with Density-Oriented Feature-Query Manipulation for Efficient Tiny Object Detection. To reduce feature redundancies, we introduce a lightweight Density-Focal Extractor (DeFE) to produce clustered compact foreground masks. Leveraging these masks, we incorporate Masked Window Attention Sparsification (MWAS) to focus computational resources on the most informative regions via sparse attention. Besides, we propose Progressive Adaptive Query Initialization (PAQI), which adaptively modulates query density across spatial areas for better query allocation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dome-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance (+3.3 AP on AI-TOD-V2 and +2.5 AP on VisDrone) while maintaining low computational complexity and a compact model size.

abstract = {Thin film coating is used to provide various functions to surfaces and therefore it is a technology that contributes significantly to the country's economy. With coatings at the thin film level, the quantum properties of materials are revealed, which plays a crucial role in the development of materials with new and unique properties. In the field of biomaterials, nano-functionalized surfaces obtained with thin film coatings have promising biological properties. Since the thin film coating measurements used so far cannot make precise measurements and are very costly, new methodologies should be introduced for thin film thickness measurements. We present a portable, low-cost, mass-sensitive QTF (Quartz Tuning Fork) sensor system capable of frequency measurements. In recent years, QTFs have begun to be applied as transducers to sensor systems with the potential to produce highly reliable and low-cost mass-sensitive sensors. Additionally, QTFs are known as common oscillator components because of their stable resonant frequencies. In this study, mass-dependent frequency values deposited on the QTF transducer surface with plasma coating were measured using an advanced QTF mass-sensitive sensor system. According to the frequency shift values, mathematical approaches have been introduced to the thin film thickness formed on the QTF surface and future perspectives are presented.},

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a viable solution to facilitate data collaboration, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively train a machine learning (ML) model under the supervision of a central server while ensuring the confidentiality of their raw data. However, existing studies have unveiled two main risks: (i) the potential for the server to infer sensitive information from the client's uploaded updates (i.e., model gradients), compromising client input privacy, and (ii) the risk of malicious clients uploading malformed updates to poison the FL model, compromising input integrity. Recent works utilize secure aggregation with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to guarantee input privacy and integrity in FL. Nevertheless, they suffer from extremely low efficiency and, thus, are impractical for real deployment. In this paper, we propose a novel and highly efficient approach RiseFL for secure and verifiable data collaboration, ensuring input privacy and integrity simultaneously. Firstly, we devise a probabilistic integrity check method that transforms strict checks into a hypothesis test problem, offering great optimization opportunities. Secondly, we introduce a hybrid commitment scheme to satisfy Byzantine robustness with improved performance. Thirdly, we present an optimized ZKP generation and verification technique that significantly reduces the ZKP cost based on probabilistic integrity checks. Furthermore, we theoretically prove the security guarantee of RiseFL and provide a cost analysis compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets suggest that our approach is effective and highly efficient in both client computation and communication. For instance, RiseFL is up to 28x, 53x, and 164x faster than baselines ACORN, RoFL, and EIFFeL for the client computation.},

abstract = {The structural heterogeneity of user-item interaction graphs poses a fundamental challenge for graph-based recommender systems. While Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have achieved remarkable success in collaborative filtering, their uniform low-pass filtering nature often fails to accommodate the varying spectral needs of nodes with different local structures, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a Structurally Sensitive Adaptive Graph Filter, dubbed as SSAGF, a novel framework that enables structure-aware filtering on user-item graphs. SSAGF first clusters nodes based on local structural properties, then learns customized filters per group by reinterpreting the convolutional depth in GCNs. This adaptive mechanism ensures that nodes with distinct structural roles are treated appropriately, enhancing both accuracy and fairness without significantly increasing model complexity. To further improve scalability, SSAGF avoids costly eigenvalue decompositions by approximating spectral filters through Maclaurin series expansion, transforming the convolution into a pooling-like operation over standard GCN outputs. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SSAGF consistently outperforms competitive baselines, especially in scenarios with high structural heterogeneity, offering a principled and efficient solution for structure-aware recommendation.},

One of the most popular enabling tools is the BBC micro:bit, well-known for its positive impact on teaching programming and driving engagement in the classroom. We extend these benefits by developing a new approach to coding with micro:bit: MicroCode. Unlike other experiences, MicroCode couples the micro:bit with a low-cost handheld accessory to enable live and portable programming via an on-device visual programming language; no separate host computer is needed. We present the design of MicroCode and the findings of a study in which we interviewed five primary school teachers and 60 children aged 10-11 working with MicroCode. The outcomes of the study show that MicroCode raised children’s engagement and stimulated the development of a strong sense of agency on coding activities, while teachers felt empowered to adopt situated and cross-curricular learning approaches.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices have been increasingly deployed in smart homes to automatically monitor and control their environments. Unfortunately, extensive recent research has shown that on-path external adversaries can infer and further fingerprint people’s sensitive private information by analyzing IoT network traffic traces. In addition, most recent approaches that aim to defend against these malicious IoT traffic analytics cannot adequately protect user privacy with reasonable traffic overhead. In particular, these approaches often did not consider practical traffic reshaping limitations, user daily routine permitting, and user privacy protection preference in their design. To address these issues, we design a new low-cost, open source user-centric defense system—PrivacyGuard—that enables people to regain the privacy leakage control of their IoT devices while still permitting sophisticated IoT data analytics that is necessary for smart home automation. In essence, our approach employs intelligent deep convolutional generative adversarial network assisted IoT device traffic signature learning, long short-term memory based artificial traffic signature injection, and partial traffic reshaping to obfuscate private information that can be observed in IoT device traffic traces. We evaluate PrivacyGuard using IoT network traffic traces of 31 IoT devices from five smart homes and buildings. We find that PrivacyGuard can effectively prevent a wide range of state-of-the-art adversarial machine learning and deep learning based user in-home activity inference and fingerprinting attacks and help users achieve the balance between their IoT data utility and privacy preserving.},

abstract = {Air quality estimation through sensor-based methods is widely used. Nevertheless, their frequent failures and maintenance challenges constrain the scalability of air pollution monitoring efforts. Recently, it has been demonstrated that air quality estimation can be done using image-based methods. These methods offer several advantages including ease of use, scalability, and low cost. However, the accuracy of these methods hinges significantly on the diversity and magnitude of the dataset utilized. The advancement of air quality estimation through image analysis has been limited due to the lack of available datasets. Addressing this gap, we present TRAQID - Traffic-Related Air Quality Image Dataset, a novel dataset capturing 26,678 front and rear images of traffic alongside co-located weather parameters, multiple levels of Particulate Matters (PM) and Air Quality Index (AQI) values. Spanning over multiple seasons, with over 70 hours of data collection in the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad, India, the TRAQID offers diverse day and night imagery amid unstructured traffic conditions, encompassing six AQI categories ranging from “Good” to “Severe”. State-of-the-art air quality estimation techniques, which were trained on a smaller and less-diverse dataset, showed poor results on the dataset presented in this paper. TRAQID models various uncertainty types, including seasonal changes, unstructured traffic patterns, and lighting conditions. The information from the two views (front and rear) of the traffic can be combined to improve the estimation performance in such challenging conditions. As such, the TRAQID serves as a benchmark for image-based air quality estimation tasks and AQI prediction, given its diversity and magnitude. Dataset Link},

abstract = {Sensors measuring real-life physical processes are ubiquitous in today's interconnected world. These sensors inherently bear noise that often adversely affects the performance and reliability of the systems they support. Classic filtering approaches introduce strong assumption on the time or frequency characteristics of sensory measurements, while learning-based denoising approaches typically rely on using ground truth clean data to train a denoising model, which is often challenging or prohibitive to obtain for many real-world applications. We observe that in many scenarios, the relationships between different sensor measurements (e.g., location and acceleration) are analytically described by laws of physics (e.g., second-order differential equation). By incorporating such physics constraints, we can guide the denoising process to improve performance even in the absence of ground truth data. In light of this, we design a physics-informed denoising model that leverages the inherent algebraic relationships between different measurements governed by the underlying physics. By obviating the need for ground truth clean data, our method offers a practical denoising solution for real-world applications. We conducted experiments in various domains, including inertial navigation, CO2 monitoring, and HVAC control, and achieved state-of-the-art performance compared with existing denoising methods. Our method can denoise data in real time (4ms for a sequence of 1s) for low-cost noisy sensors and produces results that closely align with those from high-precision, high-cost alternatives, leading to an efficient, cost-effective approach for more accurate sensor-based systems.},

Existing acoustic imaging methods require large transceiver arrays or device movement, which makes it challenging to use in many scenarios. In this paper, we develop a novel acoustic imaging system for low-cost devices with few speakers and microphones without any device movement. To achieve this goal, we leverage a 3D-printed passive acoustic metasurface to significantly enhance the diversity of the measurement data, thereby improving the imaging quality. Specifically, we jointly design the transmission signal, transceivers' beamforming weights, metasurface, and imaging algorithm to minimize the imaging reconstruction error in an end-to-end manner. We further develop a scheme to dynamically adapt the imaging resolution based on the distance to the target. We implement a system prototype. Using extensive experiments, we show that our system yields high-quality images across a wide range of scenarios.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in deep learning have shown that multimodal inference can be particularly useful in tasks like autonomous driving, human health, and production line monitoring. However, deploying state-of-the-art multimodal models in distributed IoT systems poses unique challenges since the sensor data from low-cost edge devices can get corrupted, lost, or delayed before reaching the cloud. These problems are magnified in the presence of asymmetric data generation rates from different sensor modalities, wireless network dynamics, or unpredictable sensor behavior, leading to either increased latency or degradation in inference accuracy, which could affect the normal operation of the system with severe consequences like human injury or car accident. In this paper, we propose PATCH, a framework of speculative inference to adapt to these complex scenarios. PATCH serves as a plug-in module in the existing multimodal models, and it enables speculative inference of these off-the-shelf deep learning models. PATCH consists of 1) a Masked-AutoEncoder-based cross-modality imputation module to impute missing data using partially-available sensor data, 2) a lightweight feature pair ranking module that effectively limits the searching space for the optimal imputation configuration with low computation overhead, and 3) a data alignment module that aligns multimodal heterogeneous data streams without using accurate timestamp or external synchronization mechanisms. We implement PATCH in nine popular multimodal models using five public datasets and one self-collected dataset. The experimental results show that PATCH achieves up to 13% mean accuracy improvement over the state-of-art method while only using 10% of training data and reducing the training overhead by 73% compared to the original cost of retraining the model.},

abstract = {Vehicles equipped with abundant sensors offer a promising way for large-scale, low-cost road data collection. To realize this potential, a well-designed vehicle scheduling scheme is essential for deploying the recruited drivers efficiently. Nevertheless, existing works fail to consider the marginal effect among drivers’ collections. Different from them, this article introduces a, to the best of our knowledge, new multiple-vehicle scheduling problem that jointly optimizes task allocation and vehicle trajectory planning to maximize the overall collection utility by accounting for the marginal effect in drivers’ data collections. However, solving this problem is non-trivial due to its involvement with multiple coupled NP-hard problems. To this end, we propose MeSched, a marginal effect-aware multiple-vehicle scheduling scheme designed for road data collection. Specifically, we first present a greedy-based auxiliary graph construction method to disentangle the initial problem into multiple independent single-vehicle scheduling subproblems. Furthermore, we build an approximate surrogate function that transforms each subproblem into a tractable form involving only a single variable. The theoretical analysis proves that MeSched can achieve a 1-(1/e)¼-approximation ratio in polynomial time. Comprehensive evaluations based on a real-world trajectory dataset of 12,493 vehicles demonstrate that MeSched can significantly improve the collection utility by 104.5% on average compared with four baselines.},

abstract = {Increasingly sophisticated low-power microcontrollers are at the heart of millions of IoT and edge computing deployments, with developers pushing large-scale data collection, processing, and inference to end nodes. Advanced workloads on resource-constrained systems depend on emerging technologies to meet performance and lifetime demands. High-performance Non-Volatile RAMs (NVRAMs) are one such technology enabling a new class of systems previously made impossible by memory limitations, including ultra-low-power designs using program state non-volatility and sensing systems storing and processing large blocks of data.Unfortunately, existing NVRAM significantly underperforms SRAM's access latency/energy cost and flash's read performance---condemning systems dependent on NVRAM to pay a steep energy and time penalty for software execution. We observe that this performance penalty stems predominately from instruction fetches into NVRAM, which represent &gt;75% of memory accesses in typical embedded software. To eliminate this performance bottleneck, we propose SwapRAM, a new operating model for NVRAM-based platforms which repurposes underutilized SRAM as an instruction cache, maximizing the proportion of accesses directed towards higher-performance SRAM. SwapRAM consists of a set of compile-time code transformations and a runtime management system that transparently and dynamically copies code into SRAM throughout execution, with an extensible logic to delay eviction of hot code. Across nine embedded benchmarks running on a real FRAM platform, SwapRAM's software-based design increases execution speed by up to 46% (average 26%) and reduces energy consumption by up to 36% (average 24%) compared to a baseline system using the existing hardware cache.},

Existing camera-based solutions pose significant concerns about privacy and extra installation costs. Although sonars have been widely used for underwater sensing in open aquatic environments such as oceans and lakes, monitoring human activities with sonars in a pool setup is still challenging. In this work, we propose AquaScan, the first scanning sonar-based underwater sensing system for human activity monitoring. To overcome the low frame rate due to the sonar's physical limitation, we propose a novel scanning strategy and apply an image reconstruction method to accelerate the scanning speed without compromising the performance of motion detection. To overcome the dynamic interferences in the underwater scenario, we develop a novel signal processing pipeline based on a physical model to remove noises and localize human subjects. We further extract features like motion, time, and spatial information from sonar images and develop a state-transfer-based activity recognition system to recognize five common water activities, i.e., swimming, motionless, splashing, struggling, and drowning. We have deployed AquaScan on three public swimming pools for a total period of 94 hours. The evaluation results show that AquaScan can successfully recognize the five activities in the water with around 91.5%.},

METRO pairs (a) easily deployable passive magnetic road markings with (b) an automotive-grade magnetic sensing framework that detects and interprets these markings. The design of METRO addresses several real-world challenges, such as mitigating the impact of magnetic disturbances, lowering deployment costs, and enhancing the durability of magnetic tags. On-road field tests of METRO demonstrate an overall accuracy of over 96% in interpreting various road markings in adverse conditions with less cost (only $0.17 per meter) than traditional road markings ($0.21--7.70 per meter). Our field evaluation of METRO over one month demonstrates the practicality and robustness of METRO in real-world settings. Specifically, we observed no performance degradation in the METRO sensor array and no damage or demagnetization to METRO's magnetic tags.},

abstract = {Whole-body motion imitation has gained wide attention in recent years as it can enhance the locomotive capabilities of humanoid robots. In this task, non-intrusive human motion capturing with RGB cameras is commonly used for its low-cost, efficiency, portability and user-friendliness. However, RGB based methods always faces the problem of depth ambiguity, leading to inaccurate and unstable imitation. Accordingly, we propose to introduce pressure sensor into the non-intrusive humanoid motion imitation system for two considerations: first, pressure can be used to estimate the contact relationship and interaction force between human and the ground, which play a key role in the balancing and stabilizing motion; second, pressure can be measured in the manner of almost non-intrusive approach, which can keep the experience of human demonstrator. In this paper, we establish a RGB-Pressure (RGB-P) based humanoid imitation system, achieving accurate and stable end-to-end mapping from human body models to robot control parameters. Specifically, we use RGB camera to capture human posture and pressure insoles to measure the underfoot pressure during the movements of human demonstrator. Then, a constraint relationship between pressure and pose is studied to refine the estimated pose according to the support modes and balance mechanism, thereby enhancing consistency between human and robot motions. Experimental results demonstrate that fusing RGB and pressure can enhance overall robot motion execution performance by improving stability while maintaining imitation similarity.},

abstract = {Cooperative embodied systems, where multiple agents collaborate through integrated perception, planning, action, and advanced reasoning powered by large language models (LLMs), show great potential for tackling complex, long-horizon, multi-objective tasks in real-world environments. Despite these algorithmic advancements, deploying embodied agents on current systems remains challenging due to prolonged planning and communication latency, limited scalability, and heightened sensitivity in low-level execution, all of which lead to significant system inefficiencies. This work proposes ReCA, a characterization and co-design framework dedicated to cooperative embodied agent system acceleration, aiming to enhance both task efficiency and system scalability. On the algorithm level, ReCA enables efficient local model processing to alleviate the substantial model costs. On the system level, ReCA presents a dual-memory structure with integrated long-term and short-term memory, hierarchical cooperative planning scheme with centralized and decentralized cooperation, and planning-guided multi-step execution for highly efficient and scalable cooperative embodied agent computation. On the hardware level, ReCA employs a heterogeneous hardware system with high-level planning GPU subsystem and low-level planning accelerator subsystem to ensure efficient and robust task execution. Evaluated across long-horizon multi-objective tasks, ReCA generalizes across application scenarios and system scales, achieving a 4.3% increase in successful missions with 10.2\texttimes{} speedup compared to the state-of-the-art cooperative embodied autonomous agent systems.},

abstract = {Indoor air pollution is a major issue in developing countries such as India and Bangladesh, exacerbated by factors such as traditional cooking methods, insufficient ventilation, and cramped living conditions, all of which elevate the risk of health issues such as lung infections and cardiovascular diseases. With the World Health Organization associating around 3.2 million annual deaths globally to household air pollution, the gravity of the problem is clear. Yet, extensive empirical studies exploring these unique patterns and indoor pollution’s extent are missing. To fill this gap, we carried out a 6-months long field study involving over 30 households, uncovering the complexity of indoor air pollution in developing countries, such as the longer lingering time of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the air or the significant influence of air circulation on the spatiotemporal distribution of pollutants. We introduced an innovative Internet of Things (IoT) air quality sensing platform, the Distributed Air QuaLiTy MONitor (DALTON), explicitly designed to meet the needs of these nations, considering factors such as cost, sensor type, accuracy, network connectivity, power, and usability. As a result of a multi-device deployment, the platform identifies pollution hot spots in low- and middle-income households in developing nations. It identifies best practices to minimize daily indoor pollution exposure. Our extensive qualitative survey estimates an overall system usability score of 2.04, indicating an efficient system for air quality monitoring.},

abstract = {Developing countries need to better manage fast increasing traffic flows, owing to rapid urbanization. Else, increasing traffic congestion would increase fatalities due to reckless driving, as well as keep vehicular emissions and air pollution critically high in cities like New Delhi. State-of-the-art traffic signal control methods in developed countries, however, use expensive sensing, computation, and communication resources. How far can control algorithms go, under resource constraints, is explored through the design and evaluation of FrugalLight (FL) in this article. We also captured and processed a real traffic dataset at a busy intersection in New Delhi, India, using efficient techniques on low cost embedded devices. This dataset () contains traffic density information at fine time granularity of one measurement every second, from all approaches of the intersection for 40 days. FrugalLight () is evaluated on the collected traffic dataset from New Delhi and another open source traffic dataset from New York. FrugalLight matches the performance of state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based sensing and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based control algorithms, while utilizing resources less by an order of magnitude. We further explore improvements using a careful combination of knowledge distillation and domain knowledge based DRL model compression, with employing Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning to quickly adapt to traffic at new intersections. The collected real dataset and FrugalLight therefore opens up opportunities for resource efficient RL based intersection control design for the ML research community, where the controller should have limited carbon footprint. Such intelligent, green, intersection controllers can help reduce traffic congestion and associated vehicular emissions, even if compute and communication infrastructure is limited in low resource regions. This is a critical step toward achieving two of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), namely sustainable cities and communities and climate action.},

abstract = {Abstract — This paper presents an automated plantar pressure monitoring system using the Internet of Things (IoT) for early detection of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). DFUs are common complications of diabetes that can negatively impact the life of a patient. Usual treatments for DFUs are drastic as they may include amputating the area affected, which is why this study aims to create a wearable foot device with a real-time monitoring system powered by the Internet of Things (IoT) to measure the plantar pressure experienced by the user. An important aspect of the prototype of this study is that it follows the three paradigms of intelligent manufacturing systems: sensing, smart, and sustainable. There will be force-sensitive resistors (FSR) to measure the plantar pressure and an LED to alert the user if an abnormal pressure is detected. Additionally, the smart feature will be represented by the IoT system that will notify the user if the plantar pressure experienced by the user exceeds the plantar threshold of 200 kPa. This system was made possible through the use of the Arduino IoT cloud, wherein the values of the FSRs and LED status can be monitored in the dashboard in real-time. The system will also automatically notify the user using the dashboard and by the LED, which turns red once any of the FSRs senses pressure greater than the threshold. To potentially help patients prevent DFUs from occurring, the prototype is designed to be a low-cost, non-disposable, reusable, and universal product.},

abstract = {The development of low-cost and non-invasive biosensors for monitoring electrochemical biomarkers in sweat holds great promise for personalized healthcare and early disease detection. In this work, we present ecSkin, a novel fabrication approach for realizing epidermal electrochemical sensors that can detect two vital biomarkers in sweat: glucose and cortisol. We contribute the synthesis of functional reusable inks, that can be formulated using simple household materials. Electrical characterization of inks indicates that they outperform commercially available carbon inks. Cyclic voltammetry experiments show that our inks are electrochemically active and detect glucose and cortisol at activation voltages of -0.36 V and -0.22 V, respectively. Chronoamperometry experiments show that the sensors can detect the full range of glucose and cortisol levels typically found in sweat. Results from a user evaluation show that ecSkin sensors successfully function on the skin. Finally, we demonstrate three applications to illustrate how ecSkin devices can be deployed for various interactive applications.},

abstract = {Current environmental challenges have profound local consequences and often benefit from the collection of fine-grained microclimate data. Advances in wireless sensor networks and the Internet of Things have led to technologies nominally suited to support remote sensing; however, in practice long-running deployments of in-field environmental sensors are rare. Field conditions are often remote and culturally sensitive, with limited power, Internet, transportation, and human infrastructure; advances in device technology alone will not suffice. We ask how communities, Internet of Things researchers, government, and other interested parties can work together to co-design useful, low burden, sustainability-focused infrastructure. Toward this end, we conducted 11 semi-structured interviews with 13 experts who use or rely on environmental sensing technology. To complement our interview data, we engaged in three months of participant observation while immersed in organizations specifically working toward manoomin (wild rice) conservation. We make two primary contributions. First, we confirm and enrich a five-stage model, the microclimate sensor lifecycle, focusing on desired features and persistent challenges. Second, we outline a space for co-design of microclimate sensors with emphasis on the cost of experience, the generally unaddressed issue of technical usability in the messy field, and the opportunity for community engagement to improve technical design and outcomes. Furthermore, we discuss future design opportunities, recommendations, and challenges in the microclimate sensor design, deployment, and sustainability space.},

How to accomplish the task of obtaining user location information with low cost and high efficiency is the core problem of this research. While the Global Positioning System (GPS) can easily obtain location information, it cannot be applied near obstacles or underground buildings. With the development of inertial sensor technology and edge computing, a safe positioning method based on inertial sensor in edge computing environment is proposed in this paper, and the corresponding indoor positioning system is designed and developed. The orbit thrust algorithm is used to realize the continuous positioning of inertial sensor. The acceleration and heading information can be obtained by using the data returned by the acceleration sensor and the direction sensor, and the required results can be obtained by analyzing and calculating on this basis, but there are many uncertainties in the calculation. The constant motion model is used to locate the system. The experiment proves that the system is feasible and can realize more accurate continuous positioning.},

abstract = {Low-cost gas sensors (LCS) often produce inaccurate measurements due to varying environmental conditions that are not consistent with laboratory settings, leading to inadequate productivity levels compared to high-quality sensors. To address this issue, we propose the use of Machine Learning (ML) to predict accurate concentrations of pollutant gases acquired by LCS integrated into an embedded Internet of Things platform. However, a key challenge is to optimize an accurate ML design under low memory and computation power constraints of microcontrollers (MCUs) while maintaining accurate ML scores.After data analysis and pre-processing, we assess and analyze the performance of five ML algorithms to predict the concentration of pollutants gases from multiple specifications (weather, presence of other gases, etc.). To support the experiments, datasets from three sources are used: (1) VOCSens, (2) Belgian Interregional Environment Agency cell, and (3) Visual-Crossing. Once the best model was optimized and validated, multiple hard constraints were added to the selected ML structure to satisfy material and expert requirements. Trained models were ported to be implemented locally in a MCU after comparing several porting libraries. The assembled code obtained is evaluated based on two metrics: storage memory consumption and inference time, relative to the highest attainable capacities.The improved random forest is the best ML model for the used dataset with an R2 score meeting of 0.72 and Root Means Square Error of 0.0028 ppm. The best generated Tiny-ML model needs 3% of RAM and 98% of Flash storage.The empirical results prove that the developed ML algorithm applied to LCS provides high accuracy to predict pollutant gases. This algorithm can also be used to adjust the LCS systems to provide calibrated data in real time, even if the platform being used is not particularly advanced or powerful.},

abstract = {Soil moisture sensing is a basic function required by applications like precision irrigation. Recently, RF based soil moisture sensing solutions [10, 43] have been proposed, which, however, can hardly support large scale deployment in challenging outdoor environments, since they must have dedicated signal emitters and also require power supply for either the signal emitters (WiFi or RFID reader) or both the transceivers (WiFi AP and client). LTE signal provides a unique opportunity for soil moisture sensing as the ubiquitously deployed base stations are naturally always-on signal emitters, eliminating the need for deploying extra hardware. In this paper, we implement a low-cost LTE based soil moisture sensor using commercial off-the-shelf hardware. We also realize duty-cycled soil sensing by automatically self-calibrating the phase offset after powering on the devices, significantly reducing the overall power consumption of the sensor. Extensive experiments show that our low-cost sensor ($55) achieves a high accuracy (3.15%) which is comparable to high-end soil moisture sensors ($850), wide coverage (2.4 km from the base station) and low power consumption (lasting 16 months using batteries).},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce SmartDampener, an open-source tennis analytics platform that redefines the traditional understanding of vibration dampeners. Traditional vibration dampeners favored by both amateur and professional tennis players are utilized primarily to diminish vibration transmission and enhance racket stability. However, our platform uniquely merges wireless sensing technologies into a device that resembles a conventional vibration dampener, thereby offering a range of tennis performance metrics including ball speed, impact location, and stroke type. The design of SmartDampener adheres to the familiar form of this accessory, ensuring that (i) it is readily accepted by users and robust under real-play conditions such as ball-hitting, (ii) it has minimal impact on player performance, (iii) it is capable of providing a wide range of analytical insights, and (iv) it is extensible to other sports. Existing computer vision systems for tennis sensing such as Hawk-eye and PlaySight, rely on hardware that costs millions of US dollars to deploy with complex setup procedures and is susceptible to lighting environment. Wearable devices and other tennis sensing accessories, such as Zepp Tennis sensor and TennisEye, using intrusive mounting locations, hinder user experience and impede player performance. In contrast, SmartDampener, a low-cost and compact tennis sensing device, notable for its socially accepted, lightweight and scalable design, seamlessly melds into the form of a vibration dampener. SmartDampener exploits opportunities in SoC and form factor design of conventional dampeners to integrate the sensing units and micro-controllers on a two-layer flexible PCB, that is bent and enclosed inside a dampener case made of 3D printing TPU material, while maintaining the vibration dampening feature and further being enhanced by its extended battery life and the inclusion of wireless communication features. The overall cost is $9.42, with a dimension of 21.4 mm \texttimes{} 27.5 mm \texttimes{} 9.7 mm (W \texttimes{} L \texttimes{} H) and a weight of 6.1 g and 5.8 hours of battery life. In proof of SmartDampener's performance in tennis analytics, we present various tennis analytic applications that exploit the capability of SmartDampener in capturing the correlations across string vibration, and racket motion, including the estimation of ball speed with a median error of 3.59 mph, estimation of ball impact location with accuracy of 3.03 cm, and classification of six tennis strokes with accuracy of 96.75%. Finally, extensive usability studies with 15 tennis players indicate high levels of social acceptance of form factor design for the SmartDampener dampener in comparison with alternative form factors, as well as its capability of sensing and analyzing tennis stroke in an accurate and robust manner. We believe this platform will enable exciting applications in other sports like badminton, fitness tracking, and injury prevention.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive abilities in various domains while the inference cost is expensive. Many previous studies exploit quantization methods to reduce LLM inference cost by reducing latency and memory consumption. Applying 2-bit single-precision weight quantization brings &gt;3% accuracy loss, so the state-of-the-art methods use mixed-precision methods for LLMs (e.g. Llama2-7b, etc.) to improve the accuracy. However, challenges still exist: (1) Uneven distribution in weight matrix. Weights are quantized by groups, while some groups contain weights with large range. Previous methods apply inter-weight mixed-precision quantization and neglect the range difference inside each weight matrix, resulting in &gt;2.7% accuracy loss (e.g. LLM-MQ and APTQ). (2) Large speed degradation by adding sparse outliers. Reserving sparse outliers improves accuracy but slows down the speed affected by the outlier ratio (e.g. 1.5% outliers resulting in &gt;30% speed degradation in SpQR). (3) Time-consuming dequantization operations on GPUs. Mainstream methods require a dequantization operation to perform computation on the quantized weights, and the 2-order dequantization operation is applied because scales of groups are also quantized. These dequantization operations lead to &gt;50% execution time.To tackle these challenges and enable fast and efficient LLM inference on GPUs, we propose the following techniques in this paper. (1) Intra-weight mixed-precision quantization. We only quantize a small fraction of groups with higher sensitivity (larger Hessian value and range variation) using 4-bit. Meanwhile, we also take the memory alignment into consideration on GPUs. (2) Exclusive 2-bit sparse outlier with minimum speed degradation. We only reserve a small fraction of large weights in 2-bit groups as sparse outliers using 16-bit, which leads to a lower average bit increment and speed degradation. (3) Asynchronous dequantization. We point out that calculating the scales of each group in 2-order de-quantization is independent of the loading weights of each group in 1-order dequantization. Thus, we design the asynchronous dequantization on GPUs. We conduct extensive experiments on different model families (e.g. Llama3, etc.) and model sizes. We achieve 2.91-bit for each weight considering all scales/zeros for different models with negligible loss. As a result, with our 2/4/16 mixed-precision quantization for each weight matrix and asynchronous dequantization during inference, our design achieves an end-to-end speedup for Llama2-7b is 1.74\texttimes{} over the original model, and we reduce both runtime cost and total cost by up to 2.53\texttimes{} and 2.29\texttimes{} with less GPU requirements.},

abstract = {A low-cost automated greenhouse system has been designed to facilitate the growth of Thai caladiums, addressing challenges posed by volatile weather conditions in Thailand. The proposed system employs the ESP-NOW protocol to enable communication and data exchange among each ESP32 microcontroller board while receiving data from sensor nodes to collect information on temperature, humidity, light intensity, as well as water level. It executes control actions, providing an optimal climate for cultivating Thai caladiums. The Blynk application displays readings of environmental measurement data and can control greenhouse appliances, including a ventilation fan, plant growth light, mist system, and solenoid valve, allowing for precise on/off control. The system successfully receives all packets of sensor data and commands from ESP-NOW communication users.

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as an effective solution for many machine learning applications. However, the great success comes with the cost of excessive computation. The Volta graphics processing unit (GPU) from NVIDIA introduced a specialized hardware unit called tensor core (TC) aiming at meeting the growing computation demand needed by DNNs. Most previous studies on TCs have focused on performance improvement through the utilization of the TC's high degree of parallelism. However, as DNNs are deployed into security-sensitive applications such as autonomous driving, the reliability of TCs is as important as performance.In this work, we exploit the unique architectural characteristics of TCs and propose a simple and implementation-efficient hardware technique called fault detection in tensor core (FDTC) to detect transient faults in TCs. In particular, FDTC exploits the zero-valued weights that stem from network pruning as well as sparse activations arising from the common ReLU operator to verify tensor operations. The high level of sparsity in tensors allows FDTC to run original and verifying products simultaneously, leading to zero performance penalty. For applications with a low sparsity rate, FDTC relies on temporal redundancy to re-execute effectual products. FDTC schedules the execution of verifying products only when multipliers are idle. Our experimental results reveal that FDTC offers 100% fault coverage with no performance penalty and small energy overhead in TCs.},

abstract = {Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) technology has been increasingly deployed in mission- and safety-critical industrial applications to achieve high throughput and deterministic communications. To provide stringent timing guarantee, TSN requires that network devices follow a predefined communication schedule for real-time end-to-end packet processing, involving both TSN bridges and end stations. Extensive efforts have been devoted on the TSN bridge design in the literature. Achieving TSN compatibility on the end stations (especially on COTS hardware), however is challenging due to their constrained resources. To fill this gap, this work presents a software-based open-source TSN end station design that i) enables ultra-low latency and nanosecond-level transmission accuracy based on DPDK, and ii) employs a novel multi-core scheduling framework to boost the throughput of real-time TSN traffic. Our proposed solution leverages existing COTS hardware and thus is more generic and cost-effective compared to existing hardware-centric solutions. We validate our design by developing a prototype end station and incorporating it in a real-world TSN testbed. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our design compared with other state-of-the-art solutions.},

In this paper, an indoor environment monitoring system constructed by sensor network is realized.

This creates a fundamental tension: the success of smart environments will become increasingly dependent on equity of access to data-driven insights and consideration of the privacy expectations of sensed individuals. These concerns highlight the need to bring equity to all stakeholders of smart environments, which in turn would preserve public trust in these smart spaces. In this work, we explored several approaches to identity-obscuring visual representations through a progressive series of experiments. We designed and validated a series of visual representations through stakeholder interactions and tested the ability of these visual representations to limit identification via a crowdsourced study. An evaluation across three months of data gathered within our organization also showed that the identity-obscured data could still be leveraged to accurately count group size. Our contributions lay the groundwork for sensing frameworks that bring utility to all stakeholders of shared spaces while being cognizant of their diverse privacy expectations.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel solution to generating molds for efficiently fabricating architectural panels. At the core of our method is a machine that utilizes a deflatable membrane as a flexible mold. By adjusting the deflation level and boundary element positions, the membrane can be reconfigured into various shapes, allowing for mass customization with significantly lower overhead costs. We devise an efficient algorithm that works in sync with our flexible mold machine that optimizes the placement of customizable boundary element positions, ensuring the fabricated panel matches the geometry of a given input shape: (1) Using a quadratic Weingarten surface arising from a natural assumption on the membrane's stress, we can approximate the initial placement of the boundary element from the input shape's geometry; (2) we solve the inverse problem with a simulator-in-the-loop optimizer by searching for the optimal placement of boundary curves with sensitivity analysis. We validate our approach by fabricating baseline panels and a facade with a wide range of curvature profiles, providing a detailed numerical analysis on simulation and fabrication, demonstrating significant advantages in cost and flexibility.},

Existing monitoring methods, including both wired and wireless sensor systems, face significant challenges due to integration complexity, weight considerations, material costs, and signal blockage within the metallic environment. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Arach-Net, an acoustic backscatter network that leverages the conductive properties of the BiW to propagate vibration signals for energy transfer and data communication. This system comprises battery-free tags that harvest energy from BiW vibrations and utilize a backscatter technique for efficient communication, thereby eliminating the need for external power sources and reducing the power consumption. We address key challenges such as power sufficiency for tag activation and sustained operation, and collision reduction in network communication, by designing an ultra-low power backscatter tag and a distributed slot allocation protocol. We implement ArachNet, and deploy 12 tags onto the BiW of an electric SUV car. The evaluation results show that the power consumption of the tag is 51.0 μW for uplink packet transmission, and 24.8 μW for downlink packet reception. With our network protocol, the slot utilization can be up to 81.2%.},

This study presents a novel methodology for improving the efficacy of signature aggregation in a scenario involving doctors and patients while mitigating concerns about location privacy. Though there have been prior proposals for signature aggregation schemes, the proposed approach seeks to optimize the aggregation process within the considered scenario, thereby improving performance and reducing computational and communication burden. In addition, the proposed scheme integrates a resilient mechanism that safeguards the doctor’s location privacy by utilizing the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). Advanced cryptographic algorithms and location-anonymization techniques are employed in the proposed method to safeguard the confidentiality of the doctors’ location. The security of the proposed scheme is formally analyzed using the Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic and formally verified using the automated software validation tool, known as the Scyther tool, and an informal analysis of various security attributes confirms the security robustness of the proposed scheme. The efficacy is evaluated in comparison to analogous works utilizing the Cygwin software. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme has lower communication costs as compared to existing competing schemes. Moreover, the serving ratio in the proposed scheme is high even if the number of patients is low for doctors.},

Adoption rates of smart farming systems are unfortunately low due to farmers’ privacy concerns and the high initial monetary costs of deploying such systems. High monetary costs can be lowered by replacing expensive sensing equipment with machine learning models. Cloud computing can be used to train models, but this suffers from poor privacy. Instead, fog and edge computing can train local models, but important geographical trends may be lost due to data segmentation. Federated learning can be used to address these challenges.A privacy-aware Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart farming architecture that uses federated learning was proposed. A prototype was deployed to gather sensor data from a local Canadian smart farm in Ottawa, Ontario. For various data-driven models, we perform nitrous oxide prediction experiments using centralized, local, federated, and distributed ensemble learning. We found that federated and ensemble learning can compete similarly well with centralized learning. Our results demonstrate that our methodology can potentially replace expensive nitrous oxide emission sensing equipment using inexpensive sensors combined with predictive analytics models.},

abstract = {Multi-sensor fusion has been widely used by autonomous vehicles (AVs) to integrate the perception results from different sensing modalities including LiDAR, camera and radar. Despite the rapid development of multi-sensor fusion systems in autonomous driving, their vulnerability to malicious attacks have not been well studied. Although some prior works have studied the attacks against the perception systems of AVs, they only consider a single sensing modality or a camera-LiDAR fusion system, which can not attack the sensor fusion system based on LiDAR, camera, and radar. To fill this research gap, in this paper, we present the first study on the vulnerability of multi-sensor fusion systems that employ LiDAR, camera, and radar. Specifically, we propose a novel attack method that can simultaneously attack all three types of sensing modalities using a single type of adversarial object. The adversarial object can be easily fabricated at low cost, and the proposed attack can be easily performed with high stealthiness and flexibility in practice. Extensive experiments based on a real-world AV testbed show that the proposed attack can continuously hide a target vehicle from the perception system of a victim AV using only two small adversarial objects.},

abstract = {In the current field of robotics, if some high-precision block-building tasks are to be achieved, it is often necessary to use visual sensors such as cameras to provide accurate target information for the robotic arm. Combined with high-precision servo drivers and motors, the position and attitude of the end effector of the robotic arm are accurately calculated through kinematic forward and inverse solutions. The information obtained by the visual system is taken as feedback and combined with the motion control of the robotic arm to form a closed-loop control system, thereby completing the high-precision construction task. However, the cost of implementing this approach is high, and it has high requirements for the environment as well as complex parameter adjustments. Then, can the same goal be achieved through other ways with lower costs and simpler processes? The imitation learning algorithm action chunking with transformers(ACT) seems to offer us a new direction. Through action blocking and time integration technology, it can effectively reduce the error of the robotic arm when imitating human actions for demonstration. Moreover, only the appropriate demonstration dataset needs to be generated for the robotic arm for direct end-to-end learning. There is no need to use high-resolution cameras and expensive motors either, which can meet the requirements of some high-precision tasks while reducing costs. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to explore the implementation effect of the ACT algorithm in actual task scenarios and goals, and analyze its implementation details and the feasibility of practical applications.},

abstract = {Incentive mechanisms are essential to incentive workers carrying mobile handheld devices to participate in mobile crowd sensing and finally achieve good truth discovery performance. However, malicious workers may report false or malicious data to defraud rewards, resulting in service quality degradation. Moreover, the existing incentive mechanism is challenging to identify malicious workers when recruiting workers in reality, which results in low accuracy of truth discovery and waste of cost. In this paper, we propose an Incentive-based Truth Discovery (ITD) scheme to incentive credible workers to submit high-quality data, thereby enhancing the accuracy of truth discovery. In the ITD, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted split-aggregation truth discovery mechanism is proposed firstly to infer the truth. The addition of the UAV can improve the accuracy of truth discovery and assist in evaluating workers’ trust. Then, we evaluate the quality of participants’ data and propose a data quality-based trust meter to update each worker’s trust to guide future recruitment efforts. Finally, a Quality-aware Trustworthy Incentive (QTI) mechanism is proposed to select credible workers for data collection and provide them with reasonable payments. The experimental results show that ITD improves the accuracy of truth discovery by 98.47%, over the state-of-the-art, at a sensing cost reduced by as high as 43.89%.},

abstract = {Sensing in low-light and dark environments has a wide range of applications. However, existing sensing technologies suffer several major challenges, such as excessive noise and low resolution. This paper proposes Mozart - a new mobile sensing system that leverages off-the-shelf Time-of-Flight (ToF) depth cameras to generate high-resolution and rich-in-texture maps for applications in dark scenarios. The design of Mozart is based on our key observation that the phase components of ToF measurements can be manipulated to expose texture information. Through in-depth analysis of the physical reflection model, we show that the textures can be exposed and enhanced using highly compute-efficient phase manipulation functions. By exploiting the physics texture models, we propose an autoencoder-based unsupervised learning approach that can automatically learn efficient representations from phase components to generate high-resolution maps. We implemented Mozart on several Android smartphone models1, and an edge testbed with standalone ToF camera platforms for various applications in the dark. The results show that Mozart can work in real time and delivers significant improvement over existing sensing technologies. Therefore, Mozart offers a low-cost, high-performance sensing technology for next-generation applications in the dark.},

abstract = {Background: Antimicrobial resistance is a major public health threat, and new agents are needed. Computational approaches have been proposed to reduce the cost and time needed for compound screening. Aims: A machine learning (ML) model was developed for the &lt;italic&gt;in silico&lt;/italic&gt; screening of low molecular weight molecules. Methods: We used the results of a high-throughput &lt;italic&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/italic&gt; methicillin-resistant &lt;italic&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/italic&gt; (MRSA) liquid infection assay to develop ML models for compound prioritization and quality control. Results: The compound prioritization model achieved an AUC of 0.795 with a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 70%. When applied to a validation set of 22,768 compounds, the model identified 81% of the active compounds identified by high-throughput screening (HTS) among only 30.6% of the total 22,768 compounds, resulting in a 2.67-fold increase in hit rate. When we retrained the model on all the compounds of the HTS dataset, it further identified 45 discordant molecules classified as non-hits by the HTS, with 42/45 (93%) having known antimicrobial activity. Conclusion: Our ML approach can be used to increase HTS efficiency by reducing the number of compounds that need to be physically screened and identifying potential missed hits, making HTS more accessible and reducing barriers to entry.},

abstract = {This paper proposes and implements a non-invasive power visualization system designed to analyze electricity consumption at the production line-level in manufacturing facilities. In Japan, commercial electricity costs are significantly affected by the maximum demand value—defined as the highest 30-minute average power usage recorded within a month. Therefore, reducing sudden power peaks is critical for minimizing operational expenses. The proposed system employs clamp-type current transformers (CT sensors), which can be attached to existing electrical lines without modifying facility infrastructure. Sensor data is wirelessly transmitted using Long Range (LoRa), a low-power, long-range communication technology, enabling centralized management and visualization of multi-line electricity data without additional wiring. This study presents the design and implementation of a complete monitoring solution composed of microcontroller-based sensor nodes, LoRa-compatible gateways, and a server-driven visualization dashboard. Evaluation in a simulated environment demonstrated adequate measurement accuracy, facilitating the identification of peak demand and enhancing intuitive understanding of consumption trends.},

abstract = {Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architectures are promising candidates for executing machine intelligence at the edge while meeting strict energy and cost reduction constraints in several application areas. To this end, we propose a new digital architecture compatible with Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks (RSNNs) trained using the PyTorch framework and Back-Propagation-Through-Time (BPTT) for optimizing the weights and the neuron’s parameters. Our architecture offers high software-to-hardware fidelity, providing high accuracy and a low number of spikes, and it targets efficient and low-cost implementations in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). We introduce a new time-discretization technique that uses request-acknowledge cycles between layers to allow the layer’s time execution to depend only upon the number of spikes. As a result, we achieve between 1.7x and 30x lower resource utilization and between 11x and 61x fewer spikes per inference than previous SNN implementations in FPGAs that rely on on-chip memory to store spike-time information and weight values. We demonstrate our approach using two benchmarks: MNIST digit recognition and a realistic radar and image sensory fusion for cropland classifications. Our results demonstrate that we can exploit the trade-off between accuracy, latency, and resource utilization at design time. Moreover, the use of low-cost FPGA platforms enables the deployment of several applications by satisfying the strict constraints of edge machine learning devices.},

abstract = {When visual sensor networks (VSNs) enter daily life in society, they not only bring great convenience but also cause people to worry about privacy. Traditional image encryption uses the snowflake effect to protect the privacy, but this can compromise the usability of directly browsing images captured by nodes in VSNs. Recently, thumbnail-preserving encryption (TPE) has been proposed to balance image usability and privacy. However, the Markov chain’s limited connectivity and high time cost, which result in low efficiency, may preclude its application in VSNs. Motivated by this, we propose a novel TPE scheme to protect the image collected in VSNs’ privacy efficiently. We first deeply study the bijective relationship between the three-pixel group and its rank, and then propose a new number method for both, based on which we design the efficient rank mapping. Subsequently, an efficient thumbnail-preserving image encryption via three-pixel rank mapping (E-TPE) is designed, achieving NR security and enhancing the Markov chain’s connectivity. The experiments demonstrate the scheme’s efficiency; that is, it is currently the quickest ideal-TPE scheme with NR security, and a good balance is achieved between usability and privacy.},

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) play a critical role in many edge computing deployments and applications. UAV are prized for their maneuverability, low cost, and sensing capacity, facilitating many applications that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive or dangerous without them. UAV are cheaper than alternative aerial analysis methods, but still incur costs from expensive human piloting and workloads which necessitate high-resolution coverage of large areas. Recently, autonomous UAV swarms have emerged to increase the speed of deployments, decrease the cost and scope of human piloting, and improve the quality of autonomous decision-making through data sharing. Autonomous UAV deployments, however, suffer from external factors. UAV are inherently power-constrained, with low onboard battery lives and limited ability to siphon power from the edge systems that support them. Certain environmental conditions, like inclement weather, wind, extreme heat, and low light also affect UAV power consumption, sensed data quality, and ultimately mission success. In this paper, we present an empirically based model for efficient autonomous swarm deployment. We built and deployed a real autonomous UAV swarm to map leaf defoliation in soybeans. Using this deployment, we determined environmental conditions which led to malfunctions, inefficient edge energy usage, and mispredictions. Using these findings, we developed a deployment model for UAV swarms that decreases malfunctions and data irregularities by 4.9X and decreases edge energy consumption by 45%, while increasing deployment times by only 4%.},

abstract = {In this paper, the performance of Low-Cost Sensors (LCS) for Air Quality (AQ) monitoring is analyzed. These sensors are unstable, unreliable and cannot replace the official ones. They suffer from deviations, drifts and errors that make them invalid for direct use, but through Machine Learning (ML) techniques, they can increase their overall accuracy. These sensors can be used in smart cities, increasing the sampling density of the AQ monitoring network, which could enable the development of new applications for citizens to plan healthy routes. After a review of the different AQ LCS, we focused on the Winsen’s ZPHS01B multisensor module because it embeds 11 different sensors in the same module. Since the information and the experimental data from field tests for this module is limited, we carry out different experiments and perform a thorough analysis, evaluating the sensor reading differences that could appear in a batch of them. We note that some of the integrated sensors are more reliable than others, but in practice they can improve their reading by using the ML models mentioned above, as they show correlation. Of all the modules tested, we observed that most of the sensors showed similar performance. However, a certain percentage of sensors in certain modules performed worse than their counterparts, which shows that at least 80% of the tested multi-sensor modules had similar levels of performance.},

abstract = {In the past few years, a large range of wireless signals such as WiFi, RFID, UWB and Millimeter Wave were utilized for sensing purposes. Among these wireless sensing modalities, WiFi sensing attracts a lot of attention owing to the pervasiveness of WiFi infrastructure in our surrounding environments. While WiFi sensing has achieved a great success in capturing the target's motion information ranging from coarse-grained activities and gestures to fine-grained vital signs, it still has difficulties in precisely obtaining the target size owing to the low frequency and small bandwidth of WiFi signals. Even Millimeter Wave radar can only achieve a very coarse-grained size measurement. High precision object size sensing requires using RF signals in the extremely high-frequency band (e.g., Terahertz band). In this paper, we utilize low-frequency WiFi signals to achieve accurate object size measurement without requiring any learning or training. The key insight is that when an object moves between a pair of WiFi transceivers, the WiFi CSI variations contain singular points (i.e., singularities) and we observe an exciting opportunity of employing the number of singularities to measure the object size. In this work, we model the relationship between the object size and the number of singularities when an object moves near the LoS path, which lays the theoretical foundation for the proposed system to work. By addressing multiple challenges, for the first time, we make WiFi-based object size measurement work on commodity WiFi cards and achieve a surprisingly low median error of 2.6 mm. We believe this work is an important missing piece of WiFi sensing and opens the door to size measurement using low-cost low-frequency RF signals.},

abstract = {Distributed Multi-exit Neural Networks (MeNNs) use partitioning and early exits to reduce the cost of neural network inference on low-power sensing systems. Existing MeNNs exhibit high inference accuracy using policies that select when to exit based on data-dependent prediction confidence. This paper presents a side-channel attack against distributed MeNNs employing data-dependent early exit policies. We find that an adversary can observe when a distributed MeNN exits early using encrypted communication patterns. An adversary can then use these observations to discover the MeNN's predictions with over 1.85\texttimes{} the accuracy of random guessing. In some cases, the side-channel leaks over 80% of the model's predictions. This leakage occurs because prior policies make decisions using a single threshold on varying prediction confidence distributions. We address this problem through two new exit policies. The first method, Per-Class Exiting (PCE), uses multiple thresholds to balance exit rates across predicted classes. This policy retains high accuracy and lowers prediction leakage, but we prove it has no privacy guarantees. We obtain these guarantees with a second policy, Confidence-Guided Randomness (CGR), which randomly selects when to exit using probabilities biased toward PCE's decisions. CGR provides statistically equivalent privacy with consistently higher inference accuracy than exiting early uniformly at random. Both PCE and CGR have low overhead, making them viable security solutions in resource-constrained settings.},

Previous efforts include adding extra sensors (e.g., accelerometer and gyroscope) or peripheral hardware to make earphones smart. These methods are usually complex in design and also incur additional cost. In this paper, we present Earmonitor, a low-cost system that uses the in-ear earphones to achieve sensing purposes. The basic idea behind Earmonitor is that each person's ear canal varies in size and shape. We therefore can extract the unique features from the ear canal-reflected signals to depict the personalized differences in ear canal geometry. Furthermore, we discover that the signal variations are also affected by the fine-grained physiological activities. We can therefore further detect the subtle heartbeat from the ear canal reflections. Experiments show that Earmonitor can achieve up to 96.4% Balanced Accuracy (BAC) and low False Acceptance Rate (FAR) for user identification on a large-scale data of 120 subjects. For heartbeat monitoring, without any training, we propose signal processing schemes to achieve high sensing accuracy even in the most challenging scenarios when the target is walking or running.},

abstract = {The absolute coverage WiFi networks is higher than it has ever been and WiFi sensing offers a device-free, contactless alternative to intrusive wearable devices for a variety of applications, in particular for ambient assisted living (AAL). However, a majority of sensing systems proposed in literature use multiple antennas for sensing, resulting in high cost that hinders development of such solutions in real life. This work surveys existing single-antenna systems as a low-cost solution in an AAL scenario. The capabilities of these systems are examined regarding their practical applicability based on testing in AAL environments, leveraging multiple links (i.e. transmitter-receiver pairs) and considering mobile and repositioned receivers. It is found that while the AAL use-cases of respiration monitoring, fall detection and activity recognition are realised by existing systems, further testing in realistic AAL environments with the inclusion of activities of daily living is needed. Additionally the full use of multiple links and consideration of a mobile receiver is still rare, but shows promising improvements. A multi-task system enabling all three applications is discussed using the Model for Ethical Evaluation of Socio-Technical Arrangements (MEESTAR). We suggest an ethically sensitive use, but identify a need for mitigation strategies to address privacy-related concerns of potentially unwilling users.},

abstract = {To achieve sustainable development, an efficient and time-effective management of waste, including household, industrial, and food waste, is crucial. This paper introduces an intelligent food waste (FW) identification and analysis system based on convolution neural network (CNN), significantly enhanced by the application of fine-tuning. This approach involves modifying the CNN model while retaining some original structures and pre-trained parameters, and training it using a new dataset. The implementation of this method has led to a remarkable increase in the accuracy of the CNN model from 94.7% to 97.6%, a reduction in the training time cost by approximately 82.3%, and a decrease in the number of parameters that need to be trained by about 96.3%. The proposed system, an Internet of Things (IoT) system, comprises a sensing layer, network layer, data storage layer, and application layer. It autonomously identifies the type of FW using CNN, collecting and analysing food waste data, including date, weight, type, and reason. The lightweight neural network MobileNetV2 was employed because of its low computing requirements. To further enhance accuracy and reduce resource costs, fine-tuning technology was applied using a new training dataset and a new output layer in the neural network. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the original and the improved CNN model, demonstrating the significant improvements achieved through the application of fine-tuning. These results suggest that fine-tuning can enhance the accuracy and training efficiency of CNN by saving time costs and parameters, thereby contributing to the application of the CNN and fine-tuning.},

We identify post-harvest sensing through the supply chain as a key need to reduce food waste. Toward this end, we develop initial prototypes of two different wireless environmental sensing architectures. The first leverages an ultra-low power timer with a current consumption of 35 nA to power gate and periodically wake up the system. The second mode explores a sparse event driven sensing model leveraging the threshold detection features of low power sensors to log events of interest. We demonstrate a millimeter scale prototypes that can read and backscatter temperature and humidity data with as little as 3.2 μW of power.},

abstract = {Finger biometrics are widely used by smartphones as a secure and user-friendly credential for privacy protection. However, this information is difficult to measure without high-resolution images, leaving most works to treat this as an image-domain problem. We demonstrate that low-effort alternatives on smartphones are possible through the use of sound propagation in ubiquitous smartphone cases. Inexpensive and widely adopted, smartphone cases are always in contact with fingers, making them ideal for collecting finger biometrics. We thus design BioCase, an acoustic sensing system that leverages smartphone cases equipped with mini-structures to capture unique biometric-hybrid signatures (i.e., reflections influenced by the user's fingertip physiology and behavior) for smartphone privacy protection. The system generates inaudible structure-borne sound and measure the propagation through the smartphone case, mini-structures, and user finger. The design of the mini-structure controls the behavior of structure-borne sound such that unique responses are produced when different users and fingers touch the smartphone case. This enables low-cost, low-effort privacy protection, merely touching the smartphone case can authenticate users. Comprehensive experiments with 46 users over 10 weeks demonstrate BioCase can differentiate users with over 94% accuracy at a 5% false positive rate.},

abstract = {The increasing availability of low-cost wearable devices and smartphones has significantly advanced the field of sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR), attracting considerable research interest. One of the major challenges in HAR is the domain shift problem in cross-dataset activity recognition, which occurs due to variations in users, device types, and sensor placements between the source dataset and the target dataset. Although domain adaptation methods have shown promise, they typically require access to the target dataset during the training process, which might not be practical in some scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce CrossHAR, a new HAR model designed to improve model performance on unseen target datasets. CrossHAR involves three main steps: (i) CrossHAR explores the sensor data generation principle to diversify the data distribution and augment the raw sensor data. (ii) CrossHAR then employs a hierarchical self-supervised pretraining approach with the augmented data to develop a generalizable representation. (iii) Finally, CrossHAR fine-tunes the pretrained model with a small set of labeled data in the source dataset, enhancing its performance in cross-dataset HAR. Our extensive experiments across multiple real-world HAR datasets demonstrate that CrossHAR outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by 10.83% in accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generalizing to unseen target datasets.},

We propose bespoke ternary neural networks using approximate popcount and popcount-compare units, developed through a multi-phase evolutionary optimization approach and interfaced with sensors via customizable analog-to-binary converters.

abstract = {The scaling of per-GB DRAM cost has slowed down in recent years. Recent research has suggested that adding remote memory to a system can further reduce the overall memory cost while maintaining good performance. Remote memory (i.e., tiered memory), connected to host servers via high-speed interconnect protocols such as RDMA and CXL, is expected to deliver 100x (less than 1µs) lower latency than SSD and be more cost-effective than local DRAM through pooling or adopting cheaper memory technologies.Tiered memory opens up a large number of potential use cases within database systems. But previous work has only explored limited ways of using tiered memory. Our study provides a systematic study for DBMS to build tiered memory buffer management with respect to a wide range of hardware performance characteristics. Specifically, we study five different indexing designs that leverage remote memory in different ways and evaluate them through a wide range of metrics including performance, tiered-memory latency sensitivity, and cost-effectiveness. In addition, we propose a new memory provisioning strategy that allocates an optimal amount of local and remote memory for a given workload. Our evaluations show that while some designs achieve higher performance than others, no design can win in all measured dimensions.},

abstract = {Digital twins, which are increasingly adopted in industry, are model-centric systems used to improve the behavior of a twinned physical system. Seen as a whole, this system has several layers of self-adaptation: first, the digital twin manages its physical counterpart and maintains its models through a feedback loop to, e.g., fine-tune model parameters. Second, the digital twin needs to deal with unforeseen changes in the composition of the physical system, which require models to be partly replaced or recomposed. To facilitate research on self-adaptive digital twins, without requiring access to industrial production systems, this paper presents GreenhouseDT, an exemplar that explicitly separates these layers of self-adaptation. GreenhouseDT provides an extensible software architecture for a digital twin of a simple, low-cost greenhouse, in which plants, sensors and water pumps constitute the physical system. GreenhouseDT includes an asset model in the digital twin's knowledge base and uses reflection to lift twinned configurations into the knowledge base. We discuss how GreenhouseDT can be extended with different digital twin capabilities, demonstrated by the addition of plant health monitoring and model-based control.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring and predictive maintenance promise to significantly reduce costs, increase availability, and improve safety of civil infrastructure and industrial facilities. Wireless and batteryless sensors fuel these applications with the required data. As metal structures often shield sensor nodes from electromagnetic waves, acoustic power and data transfer are promising alternatives. However, the metal channel suffers from severe multipath propagation, limiting data rates to typically less than 200 bits-1. We investigate wideband pulses as alternative to commonly used continuous wave modulation schemes to increase robustness. In a simulation study, we first compare wideband modulation with narrowband modulation schemes and assess their robustness against noise and clock deviations. We then construct a wirelessly powered tag prototype to validate the simulation results in real-world metal channels. Furthermore, we propose a reader-based synchronization scheme to mitigate clock mismatch, which is inevitable with ultra-low-power tags. The results show that wideband pulse-position modulation is the most favorable modulation scheme, increasing the median data rates in many scenarios by 132% over continuous-wave schemes. Additionally, wideband pulses are advantageous for power transfer in the highly frequency-selective channel when optimal carrier frequencies are yet unknown. However, simultaneous power transfer and communication on the same transducer are shown to interfere with each other, complicating the receiver design.},

In this work we demonstrate how camera-based perception can be unobtrusively manipulated to enable an attacker to create spurious objects or alter an existing object, by remotely projecting adversarial patterns into cameras, exploiting two common effects in optical imaging systems, viz., lens flare/ghost effects and auto-exposure control. To improve the robustness of the attack, we generate optimal patterns by integrating adversarial machine learning techniques with a trained end-to-end channel model. We experimentally demonstrate our attacks using a low-cost projector on three different cameras, and under different environments. Results show that, depending on the attack distance, attack success rates can reach as high as 100%, including under targeted conditions. We develop a countermeasure that reduces the problem of detecting ghost-based attacks into verifying whether there is a ghost overlapping with a detected object. We leverage spatiotemporal consistency to eliminate false positives. Evaluation on experimental data provides a worst-case equal error rate of 5%.},

abstract = {Transient execution attacks (TEAs), such as Spectre and Meltdown, exploit speculative execution to leak sensitive data through residual microarchitectural state. Traditional defenses often incur high performance and hardware costs by delaying speculative execution or requiring additional shadow structures and dynamic information flow tracking. In contrast, our approach models these attacks as violations of software-defined security contracts and enforces these contracts in hardware using existing features. We introduce Speculative Address Sanitization (SpecASan), which leverages ARM’s Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) to extend memory safety protection from the committed path to the speculative path. When a speculative access does not pass the MTE tag comparison, this access is delayed until speculation resolves. This ensures that only validated accesses affect the microarchitectural state while preserving the performance benefits of speculation. When combined with Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) enforcement mechanisms, already supported by some hardware implementations, our evaluation shows that SpecASan effectively mitigates a broad class of transient execution attacks, including Spectre and Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS). Furthermore, SpecASan achieves this with low performance overhead and minimal hardware complexity, highlighting its practicality and efficiency.},

To tackle the unique challenges of radar sensing from the egocentric perspective (e.g., random radar motion and the scarcity of information on the lower body), we propose several technical designs, including root-relative radar motion tracking for radar motion decoupling and a two-stage pose estimator that incorporates human kinematics priors.

Unlike traditional device-based sensing, wireless sensing is contactless, pervasive, low cost, and non-invasive, making it highly suitable for relevant IoT applications. However, most existing methods are highly dependent on high-quality datasets, and the minority class will not achieve a satisfactory performance when suffering from a class imbalance problem. In this article, we propose a time–frequency semantic generative adversarial network framework (i.e., TFSemantic) to address the imbalanced classification problem in human activity recognition using radio frequency (RF) signals. Specifically, the TFSemantic framework can learn semantic features from the minority classes and then generate high-quality signals to restore data balance. It includes a data pre-processing module, a semantic extraction module, a semantic distribution module, and a data augmenter module. In the data pre-processing module, we process four different RF datasets (i.e., WiFi, RFID, UWB, and mmWave). We also develop Fourier semantic feature convolution and attention semantic feature embedding methods for the semantic extraction module. A discrete wavelet transform is utilized for reconstructed RF samples in the semantic distribution module. In data augmenter module, we design an associated loss function to achieve effective adversarial training. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed TFSemantic framework using different RF datasets, which outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.},

Our lightweight deep network then reconstructs the hand pose from the distance matrix. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach is both accurate, size-agnostic, and robust to external interference.

However, GPU nodes are connected with lower network bandwidth and cloud providers charge extra for data transfers across geographical regions. In this work, we explore when and how it makes sense to leverage GPUs across zones and regions for distributed ML training. We analyze the throughput and cost impact of cross-region training based on the computation and communication patterns of different model parallelism strategies, develop a profile-based analytical model for estimating training throughput and cost, and provide guidelines for allocating geo-distributed resources efficiently. We find that although ML training throughput and cost with pure data parallelism degrades significantly when nodes span geographic regions, cross-region training with pipeline parallelism is practical.},

abstract = {A large number of traffic collisions occur as a result of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) obstructions. Recent work has explored NLoS automotive radar sensing systems to detect objects in occluded regions. However, current NLoS radars require substantial ambient reflectors, whose size needs to scale with the desired angular resolution and coverage, impeding their deployment in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose Metasight, which leverages carefully designed passive millimeter-wave metasurface reflectors and a novel angular encoding scheme to dramatically reduce the reflector size. The Metasight metasurfaces are fully passive, low cost, and can be fabricated by simply using a 3D printer and copper tape. By processing the reflected signals with a robust angle decoding algorithm on the radar, Metasight achieves high NLoS sensing resolution and wide coverage, with an asymptotically higher space-efficiency than conventional natural or artificial reflectors.},

In this study, we propose the technical framework of “3D sensing + digital twin + edge computing”, which achieves 0.1mm inspection accuracy of highly reflective metal parts through the fusion of laser scanning and structured light imaging, and the defect leakage rate is reduced from 8% to 0.5%; reinforcement learning dynamically optimizes the energy consumption of coating process, and reduces the energy consumption of a single battery cell by 24%; spatiotemporal map convolutional network (STGCN) compresses the switching time of a vehicle to 18 minutes.

abstract = {In an era characterized by unprecedented virtual connectivity, paradoxically, individuals often find themselves disconnected from genuine human interactions. The advent of remote working arrangements, compounded by the influence of digital communication platforms, has fostered a sense of isolation among people. Consequently, the prevailing socio-technological landscape has underscored the critical need for innovative solutions to address the emotional void. Conversational systems help people improve their everyday tasks with informative dialogues, and recent applications employ them to target emotional support conversation tasks. Nevertheless, their understanding of human feelings is limited, as they depend solely on information discernible from the text or the users’ emotional declarations. Recently, Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), devices that analyze electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, have increasingly become popular given their minimally invasive nature and low cost, besides enabling the detection of users’ emotional states reliably. Hence, we propose ARIEL, an emotionAl suppoRt bcI dEvices and Llm-based conversational agent that aims at supporting users’ emotional states through conversations and monitoring them via BCI. In this way, it is possible to comprehend the users’ feelings reliably, thus making the conversational agent aware of users’ emotional evolution during conversations. Our framework makes the LlaMA 2 chat model communicate with an emotion recognition BCI-based system to achieve the emotional support conversation goal. Also, we present a controlled running example that shows the potential of our model and its effective functioning, made possible by a wisely designed hard-prompt strategy. In the future, we will conduct an in-vivo experiment to evaluate the system and its components.},

abstract = {Printed electronics allow for ultra-low-cost circuit fabrication with unique properties such as flexibility, non-toxicity, and stretchability. Because of these advanced properties, there is a growing interest in adapting printed electronics for emerging areas such as fast-moving consumer goods and wearable technologies. In such domains, analog signal processing in or near the sensor is favorable. Printed neuromorphic circuits have been recently proposed as a solution to perform such analog processing natively. Additionally, their learning-based design process allows high efficiency of their optimization and enables them to mitigate the high process variations associated with low-cost printed processes. In this work, we address the aging of the printed components. This effect can significantly degrade the accuracy of printed neuromorphic circuits over time. For this, we develop a stochastic aging-model to describe the behavior of aged printed resistors and modify the training objective by considering the expected loss over the lifetime of the device. This approach ensures to provide acceptable accuracy over the device lifetime. Our experiments show that an overall 35.8% improvement in terms of expected accuracy over the device lifetime can be achieved using the proposed learning approach.},

In this paper, we propose RAGraph, a Region-Aware framework for geo-distributed graph processing. At the core of RAGraph, we design a region-aware graph processing framework that allows advancing inefficient global updates locally and enables sensible coordination-free message interactions. RAGraph also contains an adaptive hierarchical message interaction engine to switch interaction modes adaptively based on network heterogeneity and fluctuation, and a discrepancy-aware message filtering strategy to filter important messages. Finally, the experiments show that RAGraph can achieve 1.69X - 40.53X speedup and 20.9% - 97% WAN cost reduction compared with state-of-the-art systems.},

abstract = {Underwater environments are emerging as a new frontier for data science thanks to an increase in deployments of underwater sensor technology. Challenges in operating computing underwater combined with a lack of high-speed communication technology covering most aquatic areas means that there is a significant delay between the collection and analysis of data. This in turn limits the scale and complexity of the applications that can operate based on these data. In this article, we develop underwater fog computing support using low-cost micro-clouds and demonstrate how they can be used to deliver cost-effective support for data-heavy underwater applications. We develop a proof-of-concept micro-cloud prototype and use it to perform extensive benchmarks that evaluate the suitability of underwater micro-clouds for diverse underwater data science scenarios. We conduct rigorous tests in both controlled and field deployments, using river and sea waters. We also address technical challenges in enabling underwater fogs, evaluating the performance of different communication interfaces and demonstrating how accelerometers can be used to detect the likelihood of communication failures and determine which communication interface to use. Our work offers a cost-effective way to increase the scale and complexity of underwater data science applications, and demonstrates how off-the-shelf devices can be adopted for this purpose.},

To minimize the impacts on I/O latency and data security, this article proposes a polling-based scheduling approach for data sanitization in high-density SSDs. Our method polls a specific SSD channel for completing data sanitization at the block granularity, meanwhile other channels can still service I/O requests. Furthermore, our method assigns a low priority to the blocks that are more likely to have future adjacent page invalidations inside sanitization-required wordlines, while selecting the sanitization block, to minimize the negative impacts of moving valid pages. Through a series of emulation experiments on several disk traces of real-world applications, we show that our proposal can decrease the negative effects of data sanitization in terms of the risk-performance index, which is a united time metric of I/O responsiveness and the unsafe time interval, by 16.34%, on average, compared to related sanitization methods.},

abstract = {Remote sensing has significantly progressed and are becoming more readily available than ever. There is a growing requirement for the automatic recognition and labelling of these images under various conditions. Many studies have applied deep learning networks like CNN to satellite image recognition. However, the cost of the models is high, which means they are inappropriate when computing resources are limited, for instance, satellites and mobile devices. Moreover, the quality of available satellite images varies, and the ability of the network to adapt to low-quality images is also critical. To solve these problems, this paper uses mobile-net V2 and traditional CNN networks to classify 21 kinds of satellite images from a public dataset and compare the results. Firstly, the dataset is increased from 100 to 500 per class through data augmentation. Secondly, mobile-net V2 is trained and then the performance is evaluated using the test set. Additionally, the quality of the images is reduced to figure out the influence of each model. To verify the effectiveness and accuracy of mobile-net V2, several traditional CNN networks are compared with validation data accuracy, test data accuracy, inference time, peak RAM, and flash usage. The experimental results show that the mobile-net V2 network is a low-cost and well adaptability model with high accuracy for this multiclassification work.},

abstract = {Certain data compression techniques like pruning leads to unstructured sparse Convolution Neural Network (CNN) models without directly leveraging sparsity in optimizing both memory consumption and inference latency of a model having low to medium sparsity. State-of-the-art storage techniques either optimize model size at the cost of execution latency or optimize inference latency at the overhead of the memory consumption of the model. This tradeoff is largely due to the absence of storage selection methodology addressing sparsity sensitivity, arising from varied sparsity and positions of nonzero values called sparsity structure across different sparse layers of a model. However, this issue remains unexplored due to the lack of support to handle sparse data in the current deployment standards for edge devices. This article introduces a data compaction strategy for unstructured sparse data that not only compresses nonzero data but also encodes it, leveraging the memory consumption and latency reduction benefits of both data compression and data encoding techniques. We propose a novel storage representation, named Encoded Partitioned Hybrid Sparse (EPaHS) format, which addresses sparsity sensitivity by customizing data storage based on the sparsity structure of the data. Our data compaction technique and storage solution optimizes the tradeoff between the memory consumption and inference latency of a sparse model without altering the network architecture and affecting its accuracy. Our solution easily extends to higher-dimensional data and outperforms standard storage solutions. It proves to be beneficial to all the valid mode orientations of multi-dimensional data. For an important health and wellness application, a single-lead short-time ECG classification model, EPaHS achieves up to  ({tt 16.18%})  reduction in size and  ({tt 15.16%}) reduction in latency when compared to its original model of  ({tt 42})  MB size and  ({tt 26.35})  sec latency, having  ({tt approx 59%})  sparsity.

Accurate commercial soil moisture sensors often require manual data collection and cost thousands of dollars, which makes data collection inefficient and only accessible to high-budget smart farms. To achieve cost-effective and high-efficient soil moisture sensing, we propose a millimeterwave (mmWave) radar-based method, which can obtain the soil moisture from the propagation time and Angle of Arrival (AoA) of the reflected signals received at multiple antennas. Our method only requires a single Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) mmWave radar to automatically estimate the soil moisture level.

This has made them turn to low-cost solutions that can enable smart sensing and tracking without adding much overhead. One such popular low-power solution is backscatter-based sensing and communication system. While it offers the promise of battery-less tags, it does so at the cost of a reduced communication range. In this work, we propose PACT - a scalable communication system that leverages the knowledge asymmetry in the network to improve the communication range of the tags. Borrowing from the backscatter principles, we design custom PACT Tags that are battery-less but use an active radio to extend the communication range beyond standard passive tags. They operate using the energy harvested from the PACT Source. A wide-band Reader is used to receive multiple Tag responses concurrently and upload them to a cloud server, enabling real-time monitoring and tracking at a longer range. We identify and address the challenges in the practical design of battery-less PACT Tags using an active radio and prototype them using off-the-shelf components. We show experimentally that our Tag consumes only 23μJ energy, which is harvested from an excitation Source that is up to 24 meters away from the Tag. We show that in outdoor deployments, the responses from an estimated 520 Tags can be received by a Reader concurrently while being 400 meters away from the Tags.},

abstract = {Arrhythmia is a common problem of irregular heartbeats, which may lead to serious complications such as stroke and even mortality. Due to the paroxysmal nature of arrhythmia, its long-term monitoring and early detection in daily household scenarios, instead of depending on ECG examination only available during clinical visits, are of critical importance. While ambulatory ECG Holter and wearables like smartwatches have been used, they are still inconvenient and interfere with users' daily activities. In this paper, we bridge the gap by proposing mmArrhythmia, which employs low-cost mmWave radar to passively sense cardiac motions and detect arrhythmia, in an unobtrusive contact-less way. Different from previous mmWave cardiac sensing works focusing on healthy people, mmArrhythmia needs to distinguish the minute and transient abnormal cardiac activities of arrhythmia patients. To overcome the challenge, we custom-design an encoder-decoder model that can perform arrhythmia feature encoding, sampling and fusion over raw IQ sensing data directly, so as to discriminate normal heartbeat and arrhythmia. Furthermore, we enhance the robustness of mmArrhythmia by designing multichannel ensemble learning to solve the model bias problem caused by unbalanced arrhythmia data distribution. Empirical evaluation over 79,910 heartbeats demonstrates mmArrhythmia's ability of robust arrhythmia detection, with 97.32% accuracy, 98.63% specificity, and 92.30% sensitivity.},

abstract = {Understanding spectrum activity is challenging when attempted at scale. The wireless community has recently risen to this challenge in designing spectrum monitoring systems that utilize many low-cost spectrum sensors to gather large volumes of sampled data across space, time, and frequencies. These crowdsensing systems are limited by the uplink bandwidth available to backhaul the raw in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples and power spectrum density (PSD) data needed to run various applications. This paper presents FlexSpec, a framework based on the Walsh-Hadamard transform to compress spectrum data collected from distributed and low-cost sensors for real-time applications. This transformation allows sensors to significantly save uplink bandwidth thanks to its inherent properties both when it is applied to IQ and PSD data. Additionally, by leveraging a feedback loop between the sensor and the edge device it connects to, FlexSpec carefully adapts the compression ratio over time to changes in the spectrum and different applications, jointly considering data size, application performance, and spectrum variations. We experimentally evaluate FlexSpec in several applications. Our results show that FlexSpec is particularly suitable for IoT transmissions and signals close to the noise floor. Compared with prior work, FlexSpec provides up to &lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$7times $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; more reduction of uplink data size for signal detection based on PSD data, and reduces up to &lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$6times $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; to &lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$8times $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; the number of undecodable messages for IQ sample decoding.},

abstract = {Image sensors have low costs and broad applications, but the large data volume they generate can result in significant energy and latency overheads during data transfer, storage, and processing. This paper explores how shifting from traditional binary encoding to delay-based codes early on can address these inefficiencies, enabling keypoint detection and tracking within digital pixel sensors. The result is SEAL, a Single-Event Architecture for In-Sensor Localization. SEAL optimizes the entire pipeline between the pixel array and the sensor-processor interface by introducing a temporal processor co-designed with analog-to-time converters, followed by a custom heavily quantized frontend processor. Its implementation is fully digital, relying on off-the-shelf CMOS cells and EDA tools, and adheres to race logic’s single-wire-per-variable and single-event-per-wire policies to maximize energy and area efficiency wherever possible. Our evaluation—combining analog and digital simulations, FPGA prototyping, and an end-to-end system analysis incorporating a host processor for visual inertial odometry (VIO) backend tasks—demonstrates a 16–61 \texttimes{} reduction in the latency of keypoint detection and tracking compared to software baselines running on the host processor, and a 7 \texttimes{} reduction in energy consumption compared to a standard digital pixel sensor without processing capabilities. Meanwhile, SEAL preserves robust tracking accuracy: on the EuRoC dataset, the average root mean square absolute trajectory error decreases by 1.0&nbsp;cm for HybVIO and increases by just 0.3&nbsp;cm for VINS-Mono compared to their original implementations.},

abstract = {Backscatter tag based sensing has received a lot of attention recently due to the battery-free, low-cost, and widespread use of backscatter tags, e.g., RFIDs. Despite that, they suffer from an extensive, costly, and time-consuming redesign effort when there are changes in application requirements, such as changes in sensing targets or working frequency bands. This paper introduces a reconfigurable sensing framework, which enables us to easily reconfigure the design parameters of chipless backscatter tags for sensing different targets or working with different frequency bands, without the need for onerous design effort. To realize this vision, we capture the relationship between the application requirements and the sensing tag’s design parameters. This relationship enables us to fast and efficiently reconfigure/change an existing sensing tag design to meet new application requirements. Real-world experiments show that, by using our reconfigurable framework to flexibly redesign a tag’s parameters, the sensing tag achieves more than 92.1% accuracy for sensing four different applications and working on four different frequency bands.},

abstract = {Occupancy sensing and estimation in large commercial buildings has become a significant problem to be solved, with applications ranging from occupancy-based HVAC control to space planning, and security, etc. Thermal sensing is a promising technology to solve this problem, being easy to deploy in practice and allowing an actual occupancy count in a particular room without violating the data and privacy concerns. While initial strides have been made to solve this problem with thermal arrays, there are many problems that remain unsolved, including accuracy performance, overlapping of sensing areas that lead to under/over-counting, and data training requirements for different zones. In this paper, we introduce TODOS 1, a novel system for estimating occupancy in intelligent buildings. TODOS uses a low-cost, low-power thermal sensor array along with a passive infrared sensor. We introduce a novel data processing pipeline that allows us to automatically extract features from the thermal images using an artificial neural network. Through an extensive experimental evaluation2, we show that TODOS provides occupancy detection accuracy of 98% to 100% under different scenarios. In addition, it solves the issue of occupancy over/under-counting by overlapping sensing areas when using multiple thermal sensors in large rooms. This is done by treating the entire area as a single input thermal image instead of partitioning the area into multiple thermal images individually processed. Furthermore, TODOS introduces a data augmentation technique that allows the generation of training data for rooms of different sizes and shapes, without requiring specific training data from each room. Using these data, TODOS can train specifically designed neural networks optimized for any room size and shape, and achieve almost the same level of occupancy detection accuracy in rooms where experimental labeled training data is available, making it a viable solution that generalizes to the different rooms in large buildings.},

Here, we proposed a method to obtain the index from sweat and thus designed a wearable, low-cost electrochemical sensing system for rapid and quantitative testing of CEA in sweat. The system is composed of a sensor with sweat extraction and electrochemical sensing and a self-developed potentiostat. The sensors were designed with screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) modified with AuNPs/rGO, which were successfully synthesized using electrochemical deposition method. Then, the chip was assembled by combing the modified SPEs with a microfluidic sweat collector. The chip we designed enables in vivo skin adhesion and sweat collection for analyzing CEA. The performance of the sensing system was validated with the reversible electrochemical reaction indicator K3[Fe(CN)6]. The results show the system can test CEA in the linear range of 0.2∼100 ng/mL.},

It spread node information in a conversion way. In this article, we have studied the differences between CNN and GCN in the classification of high -spectrum image. Because the traditional GCN algorithm needs to build an adjacent matrix on all data, the calculation cost is very high, especially in large -scale remote sensing problems. MinigCNS uses a small -batch learning method to solve the problem of CCN calculation costs, and then it has not solved the problem of low efficiency of single model classification.

We experimented with the fusion algorithm on the two high -spectrum data sets, and its overall accuracy can reach 88.8%in Indian Pines.

abstract = {Large-aperture coprime arrays (CAs) are expected to achieve higher sensing resolution than conventional dense arrays (DAs), yet with lower hardware and energy cost. However, existing CA far-field localization methods cannot be directly applied to near-field scenarios due to channel model mismatch. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an efficient near-field localization method for CAs. Specifically, we first construct an effective covariance matrix, which allows to decouple the target angle-and-range estimation. Then, a customized two-phase multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm for CAs is proposed, which first detects all possible targets' angles by using an angular-domain MUSIC algorithm, followed by the second phase to resolve the true targets' angles and ranges by devising a range-domain MUSIC algorithm. Finally, we show that the proposed method is able to locate more targets than the subarray-based method as well as achieve lower root mean square error (RMSE) than DAs.},

A thorough analysis of the positioning and navigation technologies for current mobile rescue robots was conducted, encompassing visual, radar, visible light, and inertial navigation fusion technologies. In coping with the complex post-accident environment in mines, multi-sensor fusion technologies are widely adopted to ensure efficient information acquisition and processing. To ensure reliable data transmission, communication technologies mainly involve UWB (Ultra-wide band), WiFi, 4G, 5G, and visible light. Particular emphasis is placed on the advantages of visible light technology, which enables independent communication and low energy consumption under lighting conditions. This paper proposes the use of a mobile robot cluster as an effective means to improve efficiency and reduce costs. However, careful task allocation is essential to ensure effective communication among robots and avoid resource wastage. Artificial intelligence and next-generation communication technologies will make mobile rescue robots more intelligent, autonomous, and adaptable, thereby making a greater contribution to improving rescue efficiency and reducing risks.},

abstract = {Distributed systems are ubiquitous, and their distributed nature make them particularly vulnerable to faults. Being able to automatically recover from these faults is of utmost importance, and self-stabilization is a general and lightweight approach to tackle this problem. However, fully asynchronous self-stabilizing algorithms (FASS) are notoriously difficult to design and prove. It thus makes sense to create and prove a transformer that turns synchronous algorithms into FASSes.The Rollback Compiler of Awerbuch and Varghese (FOCS 1991) is such a transformer. The problem is that although it produces FASSes that are fast (time being evaluated in rounds), we prove that their energy requirement (measured through the number of state changes) can be exponential in the number n of nodes. Actually, regardless of the problem, the literature only contains a few FASSes which are asymptotically optimal time-wise. Moreover, several of these algorithms have been shown to require an exponential amount of energy, and no such algorithms are known to be energy-efficient.In this paper, we introduce the first transformer that turns any terminating synchronous algorithm into a fully asynchronous self-stabilizing algorithm with essentially the same time complexity and with a low energy requirement (polynomial in n). However, as for the rollback compiler, this comes at the cost of a (reasonable) memory increase. Our approach is compatible with most models, ranging from the LOCAL model (a powerful synchronous fault-free model), down to models such as the Stone Age model, in which a node cannot even know how many neighbors it has.In particular, we can transform extremely fast algorithms such as the classical Θ{log*n)-time ring coloring algorithm by Cole and Vishkin (FOCS 1986) into fast and energy-efficient FASSes. We also provide the best FASSes so far for many classical distributed problems such as leader election and spanning tree constructions (e.g., BFS, shortest-path).},

abstract = {The ever increasing scale of modern data center demands more effective optimizations, as even a small percentage of performance improvement can result in a significant reduction in data-center cost and its environmental footprint. However, the diverse set of workloads running in data centers also challenges the scalability of optimization solutions. Profile-guided optimization (PGO) is a promising technique to improve application performance. Sampling-based PGO is widely used in data-center applications due to its low operational overhead, but the performance gains are not as substantial as the instrumentation-based counterpart. The high operational overhead of instrumentation-based PGO, on the other hand, hinders its large-scale adoption, despite its superior performance gains.In this paper, we propose CSSPGO, a context-sensitive sampling-based PGO framework with pseudo-instrumentation. CSSPGO offers a more balanced solution to push sampling-based PGO performance closer to instrumentation-based PGO while maintaining minimal operational overhead. It leverages pseudoinstrumentation to improve profile quality without incurring the overhead of traditional instrumentation. It also enriches profile with context-sensitivity to aid more effective optimizations through a novel profiling methodology using synchronized LBR and stack sampling. CSSPGO is now used to optimize over 75% of Meta's data center CPU cycles. Our evaluation with production workloads demonstrates 1%-5% performance improvement on top of state-of-the-art sampling-based PGO.},

Furthermore, we address the problem of parameter optimization of the MAX-&lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$k$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; policy by developing online learning algorithms with stochastic feedback and a continuous search space. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the joint solution of the MAX-&lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$k$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; policy and particle swarm optimization-based online learning achieves a high performance, outperforming the well-known upper confidence bound-based competitor.},

abstract = {High-speed communication and accurate sensing are of vital importance for future transportation system. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system has the advantages of high spectrum efficiency and low hardware cost, satisfying the requirements of sensing and communication. Therefore, ISAC is considered to be a promising technology in the future transportation system. However, due to the low transmit power of signal and the influence of harsh transmission environment on radar sensing, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) at the radar receiver is low, which affects the sensing performance. This paper introduces the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) into ISAC system. With IRS composed of M sub-surfaces implemented on the surface of the target. The SNR at the radar receiver is 20lg(M) times larger than the scheme without IRS. Correspondingly, radar detection probability is significantly improved, and Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for ranging and velocity estimation is reduced. This paper proves the efficiency of IRS enabled ISAC system, which motivates the implementation of IRS to enhance the sensing capability in ISAC system.},

abstract = {A comprehensive patient health history is essential for patient care and healthcare research. However, due to the distributed nature of healthcare services, patient health records are often scattered across multiple systems. Existing record linkage approaches primarily rely on patient identifiers, which have inherent limitations such as privacy invasion and identifier discrepancies. To tackle this problem, we propose linking de-identified patient health records by matching health patterns without strictly relying on sensitive patient identifiers. Our model MedLink solves two challenges faced with the patient linkage task: (1) the challenge of identifying the same patients based on data collected in different timelines as disease progression makes the record matching difficult, and (2) the challenge of identifying distinct health patterns as common medical codes dominate health records and overshadow the more informative low-prevalence codes. To address these challenges, MedLink utilizes bi-directional health prediction to predict future codes forwardly and past codes backwardly, thus accounting for the health progression. MedLink also has a prevalence-aware retrieval design to focus more on the low-prevalence but informative codes during learning. MedLink can be trained end-to-end and is lightweight for efficient inference on large patient databases. We evaluate MedLink against leading baselines on real-world patient datasets, including the critical care dataset MIMIC-III and a large health claims dataset. Results show that MedLink outperforms the best baseline by 4% in top-1 accuracy with only 8% memory cost. Additionally, when combined with existing identifier-based linkage approaches, MedLink can improve their performance by up to 15%.},

abstract = {Software development Effort Estimation (SEE) comprises predicting the most realistic amount of effort (e.g., in work hours) required to develop or maintain software based on incomplete, uncertain, and noisy input. Expert judgment is the dominant SEE strategy used in the industry. Yet, expert-based judgment can provide inaccurate effort estimates, leading to projects’ poor budget planning and cost and time overruns, negatively impacting the world economy. Large Language Models (LLMs) are good candidates to assist software professionals in effort estimation. However, their effective leveraging for SEE requires thoroughly investigating their limitations and to what extent they overlap with those of (human) software practitioners. One primary limitation of LLMs is the sensitivity of their responses to prompt changes. Similarly, empirical studies showed that changes in the request format (e.g., rephrasing) could impact (human) software professionals’ effort estimates. This paper reports the first study that replicates a series of SEE experiments, which were initially carried out with software professionals (humans) in the literature. Our study aims to investigate how LLMs’ effort estimates change due to the transition from the traditional request format (i.e., "How much effort is required to complete X?”) to the alternative request format (i.e., "How much can be completed in Y work hours?”). Our experiments involved three different LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3.1) and 88 software project specifications (per treatment in each experiment), resulting in 880 prompts, in total that we prepared using 704 user stories from three large-scale open-source software projects (Hyperledger Fabric, Mulesoft Mule, Spring XD). Our findings align with the original experiments conducted with software professionals: The first four experiments showed that LLMs provide lower effort estimates due to transitioning from the traditional to the alternative request format. The findings of the fifth and first experiments detected that LLMs display patterns analogous to anchoring bias, a human cognitive bias defined as the tendency to stick to the anchor (i.e., the "Y work-hours” in the alternative request format). Our findings provide crucial insights into facilitating future human-AI collaboration and prompt designs for improved effort estimation accuracy.},

abstract = {Diffusion models have become essential generative tools for tasks such as image generation, video creation, and inpainting, but their high computational and memory demands pose challenges for efficient deployment. Contrary to the traditional belief that full-precision computation ensures optimal image quality, we demonstrate that a fine-grained mixed-precision strategy can surpass full-precision models in terms of image quality, diversity, and text-to-image alignment. However, directly implementing such strategies can lead to increased complexity and reduced runtime performance due to the overheads of managing multiple precision formats and casting operations. To address this, we introduce DM-Tune, which replaces complex mixed-precision quantization with a unified low-precision format, supplemented by noise-tuning, to improve both image generation quality and runtime efficiency. The proposed noise-tuning mechanism is a type of fine-tuning that reconstructs the mixed-precision output by learning adjustable noise through a parameterized nonlinear function consisting of Gaussian and linear components. Key steps in our framework include identifying sensitive layers for quantization, modeling quantization noise, and optimizing runtime with custom low-precision GPU kernels that support efficient noise-tuning. Experimental results across various diffusion models and datasets demonstrate that DM-Tune not only significantly improves runtime but also enhances diversity, quality, and text-to-image alignment compared to FP32, FP8, and state-of-the-art mixed-precision methods. Our approach is broadly applicable and lays a solid foundation for simplifying complex mixed-precision strategies at minimal cost.},

abstract = {With the advancement of wireless sensing technologies, RF-based contact-less liquid detection attracts more and more attention. Compared with other RF devices, the mmWave radar has the advantages of large bandwidth and low cost. While existing radar-based liquid detection systems demonstrate promising performance, they still have a shortcoming that in the detection result depends on container-related factors (e.g., container placement, container caliber, and container material). In this paper, to enable container-independent liquid detection with a COTS mmWave radar, we propose a dual-reflection model by exploring reflections from different interfaces of the liquid container. Specifically, we design a pair of amplitude ratios based on the signals reflected from different interfaces, and theoretically demonstrate how the refractive index of liquids can be estimated by eliminating the container's impact. To validate the proposed approach, we implement a liquid detection system LiqDetector. Experimental results show that LiqDetector achieves cross-container estimation of the liquid's refractive index with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of about 4.4%. Moreover, the classification accuracies for 6 different liquids and alcohol with different strengths (even a difference of 1%) exceed 96% and 95%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that achieves container-independent liquid detection based on the COTS mmWave radar by leveraging only one pair of Tx-Rx antennas.},

abstract = {Nowadays it is possible to acquire three-dimensional (3D) geometries of the vocal tract by means of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and introduce them into a 3D acoustic model to obtain their frequency response. However, it is not yet feasible to consider small variations in these geometries to tune the formant frequencies and produce, for instance, specific voice or singing effects. This work presents a methodology for doing so. First, the 3D MRI-based vocal tract geometry is discretized into a set of cross-sections from which its 1D area function is calculated. A 1D tuning algorithm based on sensitivity functions is then used to iteratively perturb the area function until the desired target frequencies are obtained. The algorithm also allows to consider vocal tract length perturbations between cross-sections. Finally, a 3D vocal tract is reconstructed using the shape of the original cross-sections with the new areas, and the new spacing between cross-sections according to the computed length variations. In this way it is possible to produce voice and singing effects by tuning the first formants of vowels while keeping the high energy content of the spectrum of 3D models at a low computational cost. Several examples are presented, ranging from the shift to lower and higher frequencies of the first formant (F1) to the generation of formant clusters. The latter is the case of the singing formant, in which F3, F4 and F5 are grouped together, or the case of biphonic singing, where F2 and F3 form a single peak to generate an overtone above the fundamental frequency.},

Its application cases include an unobstructed and low-cost input interface for wearables, whose visual sensing capabilities are usually limited. Further, MagCode's patterns can be designed to be visually-undecodable and our evaluation shows that accessing its magnetic signal requires very close approximation. These properties allow for using MagCode labels to convey covert and sensitive information, such as Easter eggs in games and payment credentials in daily life.},

Through two controlled experiments, this work explores various low-cost methods for evaluating error acceptability of freehand mid-air gestural input in virtual reality. Using a gesture-driven game and a drawing application, the first experiment elicited error characteristics through text descriptions, video demonstrations, and a touchscreen-based interactive simulation. The results revealed that video effectively conveyed the dynamics of errors, whereas the interactive modalities effectively reproduced the user experience of effort and frustration. The second experiment contrasts the interactive touchscreen simulation with the target modality - a full VR simulation - and highlights the relative costs and benefits for assessment in an alternative, but still interactive, modality. These findings introduce a spectrum of low-cost methods for evaluating recognition-based errors in VR and a series of characteristics that can be understood in each.},

The conventional security mechanisms are unsuitable for detecting attacks in the dynamic IoT-SHS context due to resource limitations and heterogeneity in low-cost healthcare devices. Deep Learning (DL) solutions for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and softwarization of the network has the potential to achieve secure network services in the IoT-SHS environment. Motivated by the aforementioned discussion, we propose an intelligent softwarized IDS for protecting the critical infrastructure of the IoT-SHS ecosystem.

To further bolster the system’s resilience, we suggest a deployment architecture for the proposed CUDA-powered IDS using OpenStack Tacker in a real SDN environment, ensuring that virtual machines can directly utilize the host’s NVIDIA GPU, thereby streamlining and enhancing the network’s operational efficiency. The experimental results using the CICDDoS2019 dataset confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework over some baseline and recent state-of-the-art techniques.},

Benefiting from edge and cloud computing, IoMT is provided with more computing and storage resources near the terminal to meet the low-delay requirements of computation-intensive services. However, the service offloading from health monitoring units (HMUs) to edge servers generates additional energy consumption. Fortunately, artificial intelligence (AI), which has developed rapidly in recent years, has proved effective in some resource allocation applications. Taking both energy consumption and delay into account, we propose an energy-aware service offloading algorithm under an end-edge-cloud collaborative IoMT system with Asynchronous Advantage Actor-critic (A3C), named ECAC. Technically, ECAC uses the structural similarity between the natural distributed IoMT system and A3C, whose parameters are asynchronously updated. Besides, due to the typical delay-sensitivity mechanism and time-energy correction, ECAC can adjust dynamically to the diverse service types and system requirements. Finally, the effectiveness of ECAC for IoMT is proved on real data.},

abstract = {The demanding need to perform privacy-preserving computations among multiple         data owners has led to the prosperous development of secure multi-party         computation (MPC) protocols. MPC offers protocols for parties to jointly compute         a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. To date, MPC         has been widely adopted in various real-world, privacy-sensitive sectors, such         as healthcare and finance. Moreover, to ease the adoption of MPC, industrial and academic         MPC compilers have been developed to automatically translate         programs describing arbitrary MPC procedures into low-level MPC executables.                 Compiling high-level descriptions into high-efficiency MPC executables is         challenging: the compilation often involves converting high-level languages into         several intermediate representations (IR), e.g., arithmetic or boolean circuits,         optimizing the computation/communication cost, and picking proper MPC protocols (and         underlying virtual machines) for a particular task and threat model. Various         optimizations and heuristics are employed during the compilation procedure to         improve the efficiency of the generated MPC executables.                 Despite the prosperous adoption of MPC compilers by industrial vendors and         academia, a principled and systematic understanding of the correctness of         MPC compilers does not yet exist. To fill this critical gap, this paper         introduces MT-MPC, a metamorphic testing (MT) framework specifically designed for         MPC compilers to effectively uncover erroneous compilations. Our approach         proposes three metamorphic relations (MRs) that are tailored for MPC programs to         mutate high-level MPC programs (compiler inputs). We then examine if MPC         compilers yield semantics-equivalent MPC executables regarding the original and         mutated MPC programs by comparing their execution results.                Real-world MPC compilers exhibit a high level of engineering quality.         Nevertheless, we detected 4,772 inputs that can result in erroneous         compilations in three popular MPC compilers available on the market. While the         discovered error-triggering inputs do not cause the MPC compilers to crash         directly, they can lead to the generation of incorrect MPC executables,         jeopardizing the underlying dependability of the computation.         With substantial manual effort and help from the MPC compiler developers, we         uncovered thirteen bugs in these MPC compilers by debugging them using the         error-triggering inputs. Our proposed testing frameworks and findings can be         used to guide developers in their efforts to improve MPC compilers.},

abstract = {Unlike non-volatile memory that resides on the processor memory bus, memory-semantic solid-state drives (SSDs) support both byte and block access granularity via PCIe or CXL interconnects. They provide scalable memory capacity using NAND flash at a much lower cost. In addition, they have different performance characteristics for their dual byte/block interface respectively, while offering essential memory semantics for upper-level software. Such a byte-accessible storage device provides new implications on the software system design.In this paper, we develop a new file system, named ByteFS, by rethinking the design primitives of file systems and SSD firmware to exploit the advantages of both byte and block-granular data accesses. ByteFS supports byte-granular data persistence to retain the persistence nature of SSDs. It extends the core data structure of file systems by enabling dual byte/block-granular data accesses. To facilitate the support for byte-granular writes, ByteFS manages the internal DRAM of SSD firmware in a log-structured manner and enables data coalescing to reduce the unnecessary I/O traffic to flash chips. ByteFS also enables coordinated data caching between the host page cache and SSD cache for best utilizing the precious memory resource. We implement ByteFS on both a real programmable SSD and an emulated memory-semantic SSD for sensitivity study. Compared to state-of-the-art file systems for non-volatile memory and conventional SSDs, ByteFS outperforms them by up to 2.7\texttimes{}, while preserving the essential properties of a file system. ByteFS also reduces the write traffic to SSDs by up to 5.1\texttimes{} by alleviating unnecessary writes caused by both metadata and data updates in file systems.},

abstract = {This article proposes a sensor data anonymization model that is trained on decentralized data and strikes a desirable trade-off between data utility and privacy, even in heterogeneous settings where the sensor data have different underlying distributions. Our anonymization model, dubbed Blinder, is based on a variational autoencoder and one or multiple discriminator networks trained in an adversarial fashion. We use the model-agnostic meta-learning framework to adapt the anonymization model trained via federated learning to each user’s data distribution. We evaluate Blinder under different settings and show that it provides end-to-end privacy protection on two IMU datasets at the cost of increasing privacy loss by up to 4.00% and decreasing data utility by up to 4.24%, compared to the state-of-the-art anonymization model trained on centralized data. We also showcase Blinder’s ability to anonymize the radio frequency sensing modality. Our experiments confirm that Blinder can obscure multiple private attributes at once, and has sufficiently low power consumption and computational overhead for it to be deployed on edge devices and smartphones to perform real-time anonymization of sensor data.},

abstract = {We give new data-dependent locality sensitive hashing schemes (LSH) for the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD), and as a result, improve the best approximation for nearest neighbor search under EMD by a quadratic factor. Here, the metric EMDs(ℝd,ℓp) consists of sets of s vectors in d, and for any two sets x,y of s vectors the distance EMD(x,y) is the minimum cost of a perfect matching between x,y, where the cost of matching two vectors is their ℓp distance. Previously, Andoni, Indyk, and Krauthgamer gave a (data-independent) locality-sensitive hashing scheme for EMDs(ℝd,ℓp) when p ∈ [1,2] with approximation O(log2 s). By being data-dependent, we improve the approximation to \~{O}(logs).   Our main technical contribution is to show that for any distribution µ supported on the metric EMDs(ℝd, ℓp), there exists a data-dependent LSH for dense regions of µ which achieves approximation \~{O}(logs), and that the data-independent LSH actually achieves a \~{O}(logs)-approximation outside of those dense regions. Finally, we show how to “glue” together these two hashing schemes without any additional loss in the approximation.   Beyond nearest neighbor search, our data-dependent LSH also gives optimal (distributional) sketches for the Earth Mover’s Distance. By known sketching lower bounds, this implies that our LSH is optimal (up to poly(loglogs) factors) among those that collide close points with constant probability.},

abstract = {Visual inspection of welding joints has the advantages of being non-contact, low-cost and highly efficient. Automotive chassis welding joints have complex forms, coupled with the increasing demand for flexible manufacturing in factories, their inspection requires more flexibility and affordability. This report proposes an adaptive robotic system for welding joint localization and inspection by placing a baseline-adjustable multi-modal (2D + 3D) vision sensor on a 6-axis cobot mounted under a movable track. The system visually recognizes the model and pose of the chassis on the production belt at a distance, and automatically generates the necessary sensor positions and poses, and trajectories for image acquisition of the welding joints. For each welding joint, the system further manipulates the sensor positions and poses to image it at a close distance from a proper direction. A coarse-to-fine registration of the obtained 3D point clouds is employed to extracts the region of interest in the images and align them to known good welding joint templates using a modified Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm with a conditional similarity metric. Finally, a KD-Tree based method is employed for defect detection using defective point ratio in the point cloud of the identified welding joint region. Experimental results show that the proposed system and methods can efficiently and effectively locate welding joints of different automobile chassis and detects defects on a variety of welding joints, achieving defect detection rate of 99.05%.},

abstract = {As the principal failure in data centers, disk failure may pose the risk of data loss, increase the maintenance cost, and affect system availability. As a proactive fault tolerance technology, disk failure prediction can minimize the loss before a failure occurs. Whereas, a weak prediction model with a low Failure Detection Rate (FDR) and high False Alarm Rate (FAR) may substantially increase the system cost due to inadequate consideration or misperception of the misclassification cost. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-sensitive learning engine CSLE for disk failure prediction, which combines a two-phase feature selection based on Cohen's D and Genetic Algorithm, a meta-algorithm based on cost-sensitive learning, and an adaptive optimal classifier for heterogeneous and homogeneous disk series. Experimental results on real datasets show that the AUC of CSLE is increased by 2%-42% compared with the commonly used rank-sum test. CSLE can reduce the misclassification cost by 52%-96% compared with the rank model. Besides, CSLE has a better pervasiveness than the traditional prediction model, it can reduce both the misclassification cost and the FAR by 16%-70% for heterogeneous disk series, and increase the FDR by 3%-29% for homogeneous disk series.},

abstract = {We present a new learning-based approach for accelerating disjunctive static bug-finders. Industrial static bug-finders usually perform disjunctive analysis, differentiating program states along different execution paths of a program. Such path-sensitivity is essential for reducing false positives but it also increases analysis costs exponentially. Therefore, practical bug-finders use a state-selection heuristic to keep track of a small number of beneficial states only. However, designing a good heuristic for real-world programs is challenging; as a result, modern static bug-finders still suffer from low cost/bug-finding efficiency. In this paper, we aim to address this problem by learning effective state-selection heuristics from data. To this end, we present a novel data-driven technique that efficiently collects alarm-triggering traces, learns multiple candidate models, and adaptively chooses the best model tailored for each target program. We evaluate our approach with Infer and show that our technique significantly improves Infer's bug-finding efficiency for a range of open-source C programs.},

abstract = {Worldwide, the production of plastics has maintained remarkable growth in recent years. Since its emergence in the 1950s, it has maintained an exponential trend, due to the fact that products made from this material are adapted to different uses, such as containers, packaging, toiletries, etc. Thermoforming is one of the plastic forming techniques, this process is largely automated, so it is vitally important to keep the machines operational most of the time. There are studies that show that low machine availability can be caused by long setup times and downtime due to equipment breakdowns. In this sense, the purpose of this research is to identify, study and solve the main causes that generate the problem of low availability in the thermoforming line of a plastic industry in Peru, since they represent high expenses for the company due to penalties for delays in the delivery of orders and additional consumption. To solve this problem, the implementation of Lean Manufacturing tools such as Single-Minute Exchange of Die (SMED), Total Productive Maintenance (TPM; Autonomous Maintenance and Planned Maintenance) and Standardized Work is proposed to increase line availability by 10%. and stay competitive in the market. This model was validated through a simulation method in the Arena software where three solution scenarios were established. After validating the model, it is concluded that the availability of machines can be increased from 80% to 93% by implementing these tools and having an optimistic scenario. In addition, the setup time indicator decreased from 56.25 minutes to 22.3 minutes, the programming time by non-standardized parameters decreased to 13.99 minutes, the number of stops due to breakdowns per year was reduced by 40.7% and the MTBF (Mean Time Between breakdowns) increased to 158.5 hours. Finally, it was possible to demonstrate economically that the project is viable, since the IRR (Internal Rate of Return) is greater than the Opportunity Cost (COK) and the Net Present Value (VAN) is greater than zero.},

abstract = {The wireless sensor network (WSN) has been gaining popularity for automation and performance improvement in different IoT-based applications. The resource-constrained nature and operating environment of IoT make the devices highly vulnerable to different attacks. However, the Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) helps to implement secure and lightweight authentication protocols for IoT. In this context, few computation-intensive authentication protocols are found in the literature that have addressed secure IoT communication in WSN. Besides, these protocols depend on the local storage of PUF-CRP, which is susceptible to security attacks. This work proposes a lightweight and secure authentication protocol for the IoT devices in WSN. A PUF and its machine learning (ML)–based soft model is integrated to ensure secure authentication and lightweight computation in WSN. PUF prevents physical attacks while carrying much less hardware fingerprints, and the ML-based PUF provides the desired resiliency against PUF identity-based attacks by eliminating the requirement of CRP-based storage. The proposed mechanism delivers two-way authentication while nullifying the attacks on IoT. The proposed protocol is implemented on Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA and Raspberry Pi for testability and performance evaluation. Experiment results and analysis signify its low-cost computations and lightweight features desired for IoT.},

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has the advantages of simple operation, sensitive response, flexible flight, long battery life and low cost, and has become a conventional way of power inspection. However, the video signal with huge data will bring a certain burden to the hardware of the data acquisition end of the system, so it is necessary to improve the sampling performance of the data acquisition end of the video compression system. In this paper, a parallel algorithm for video image compression of power transmission line inspection is proposed. By using the message passing interface function provided by MPI (message passing interface), the search and matching process of image domain block and value domain block is distributed to multiple processors for simultaneous execution. The experimental results show that when only one computing node is used, the CPU utilization efficiency is very close when the images with the same compression ratio are decompressed in two parallel modes. With the increase of the number of computing nodes, the efficiency of MPI parallel mode decreases gradually, while the efficiency of MPI+Open MP hybrid model increases. This study has certain reference value and practical value for real-time processing of transmission line inspection data.},

The study includes a field test installation to evaluate data quality under robust anonymization measures.

Still, the collection of Wi-Fi probe requests raises legitimate privacy concerns. We address potential attack models for identifying and tracking devices based on these requests and explain the data collection architecture and Technical Data Protection Concept implemented within CrowdAnym to mitigate these risks. We evaluate the impact of our approach on the quality of the CrowdAnym dataset by comparing the data from one sensor location with the number of people counted by a nearby laser scanner. We are able to show that our approach approximates visitor density well, however the deviation of our data from ground truth increases as visitor frequency increases.},

abstract = {E-health is the use of information and communication technology (ICT) for the healthcare-related services. It uses various types of digital technologies and telecommunications, such as computers, sensing devices, Internet, and mobile devices to deliver medical services. Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a communication environment optimized for low-power devices (for example, health sensors and actuators) and operation on, in, or around the human body (i.e., a patient). It can be used in various applications that are related to healthcare, such as “body automation,” “healthcare,” “medical monitoring,” “body interaction,” and “medical implants (i.e., pacemaker).” Most of the communications happen in IoMT-based e-healthcare system are wireless in nature. This may cause severe threats to the security of the system. Various information security-related attacks, i.e., replay, man-in-the-middle attack (MiTM), impersonation, privileged insider, unauthorised session key computation, credentials leakage, stolen verifier, malware injection are possible in IoMT-based e-healthcare system. These threats and attacks can create serious problems in the social life of an individual, as this may reveal their confidential healthcare information to other unauthorised parties. Therefore, it is essential to propose an access control and key management scheme to secure the communication of a IoMT-based e-healthcare system. Moreover, the security of such kind of scheme can also be enhanced through the deployment of a blockchain mechanism. Therefore, in this article, we propose a blockchain-enabled access control and key management protocol for IoMT-based e-healthcare system that is named as “BACKM-EHA” in short. The security analysis of proposed BACKM-EHA is also provided through the standard, i.e., “Real-Or-Random model.” The various conducted security analyses prove the security of BACKM-EHA against the different types of potential attacks. The performance of BACKM-EHA is better than the other existing schemes, as it requires less communication cost, computation cost, and provides more “security and functionality features.”},

abstract = {3D fingerprint capture is less sensitive to skin moisture levels and avoids skin deformation, which is common in contact-based sensors, in addition to capturing depth information. Unfortunately, its adoption is limited due to high cost and system complexity. Photometric stereo provides an opportunity to build low-cost, simple sensors capable of high-quality 3D capture. However, it assumes that the surface being imaged is lambertian (unlike our fingers). We introduce the Split and Knit algorithm (SnK), a 3D reconstruction pipeline based on the photometric stereo for finger surfaces. It introduces an efficient way of estimating the direct illumination component, thus allowing us to do a higher-quality reconstruction of the entire finger surface. The algorithm also introduces a novel method to obtain the overall finger shape under NIR illumination, all using a single camera. Finally, we combine the overall finger shape and the ridge-valley point cloud to obtain a 3D finger phalange. The high-quality 3D reconstruction also results in better matching accuracy of the captured fingerprints. 1},

abstract = {The existence of adversarial image makes us have to doubt the credibility of artificial intelligence system. Attackers can use carefully processed adversarial images to carry out a variety of attacks. Inspired by the theory of image compressed sensing, this paper proposes a new black-box attack,  (mathcal {N}text{-HSA}_{LF}) . It uses covariance matrix adaptive evolution strategy (CMA-ES) to learn the distribution of adversarial perturbation in low frequency domain, reducing the dimensionality of solution space. And sep-CMA-ES is used to set the covariance matrix as a diagonal matrix, which further reduces the dimensions that need to be updated for the covariance matrix of multivariate Gaussian distribution learned in attacks, thereby reducing the computational cost of attack. And on this basis, we propose history-driven mean update and current optimal solution-guided improvement strategies to avoid the evolution of distribution to a worse direction. The experimental results show that the proposed  (mathcal {N}text{-HSA}_{LF})  can achieve a higher attack success rate with fewer queries on attacking both CNN-based and transformer-based target models under  (L_2) -norm and  (L_infty) -norm constraints of perturbation. We also conduct an ablation study and the results show that the proposed improved strategies can effectively reduce the number of visits to the target model when making adversarial examples for hard examples. In addition, our attack is able to make the integrated defense strategy of GRIP-GAN and noise-embedded training ineffective to a certain extent.},

abstract = {Physical systems are extending their monitoring capacities to edge areas with low-cost, low-power sensors and advanced data mining and machine learning techniques. However, new systems often have limited data for training the model, calling for effective knowledge transfer from other relevant grids. Specifically, Domain Adaptation (DA) seeks domain-invariant features to boost the model performance in the target domain. Nonetheless, existing DA techniques face significant challenges due to the unique characteristics of physical datasets: (1) complex spatial-temporal correlations, (2) diverse data sources including node/edge measurements and labels, and (3) large-scale data sizes. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-graph DA based on two core designs of graph kernels and graph coarsening. The former design handles spatial-temporal correlations and can incorporate networked measurements and labels conveniently. The spatial structures, temporal trends, measurement similarity, and label information together determine the similarity of two graphs, guiding the DA to find domain-invariant features. Mathematically, we construct a Graph kerNel-based distribution Adaptation (GNA) with a specifically-designed graph kernel. Then, we prove the proposed kernel is positive definite and universal, which strictly guarantees the feasibility of the used DA measure. However, the computation cost of the kernel is prohibitive for large systems. In response, we propose a novel coarsening process to obtain much smaller graphs for GNA. Finally, we report the superiority of GNA in diversified systems, including power systems, mass-damper systems, and human-activity sensing systems.},

abstract = {Cloud FPGAs, with their scalable and flexible nature, are rapidly gaining traction as go-to hardware acceleration platforms for compute-intensive workloads. However, their increasing adoption introduces unique security challenges. The hardware-level access that FPGAs provide leads to many vulnerabilities, including the leakage of sensitive information through data remanence and the creation of analog-domain covert channels among users. A foundational requirement in these scenarios is the ability to target an individual FPGA; knowing this, cloud vendors prevent FPGA localization by restricting access to low-level information of the underlying hardware. Beyond aiding adversaries, FPGA localization enables defenders to strategically rotate FPGA usage, preventing prolonged exposure that can lead to confidential data leakage due to long-term data remanence.This paper introduces PhasePrint, a cloud FPGA localization approach using dynamic timing faults in functionally valid circuits. PhasePrint induces timing faults in a specially crafted circuit at runtime and infers delay characteristics from the resulting error pattern---without incorporating information sources blocked by cloud vendors. PhasePrint utilizes an FPGA's internal clock synthesizer to derive a clock pair with a strict phase relationship. By adjusting the phase relationship of these clocks, PhasePrint intentionally causes timing faults at runtime that reveal manufacturing variations among FPGA chips. We transform these fault locations into feature vectors to create device signatures and train a multi-class classifier on a dataset from 300 unique FPGAs across four AWS geographic regions. This entirely on-chip signature extraction method achieves &gt;99% accuracy, operates 13x faster, and costs 92% less than the state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Smart environment sensing provides valuable contextual information by detecting occurrences of events such as human activities and changes of object status, enabling computers to collect personal and environmental informatics to perform timely responses to user’s needs. Conventional approaches either rely on tags that require batteries and frequent maintenance, or have limited detection capabilities bounded by only a few coarsely predefined activities. In response, this paper explores corner reflector mechanisms that encode user interactions with everyday objects into structured responses to millimeter wave radar, which has the potential for integration into smart environment entities such as speakers, light bulbs, thermostats, and autonomous vehicles. We presented the design space of 3D printed reflectors and gear mechanisms, which are low-cost, durable, battery-free, and can retrofit to a wide array of objects. These mechanisms convert the kinetic energy from user interactions into rotational motions of corner reflectors which we computationally designed with a genetic algorithm. We built an end-to-end radar detection pipeline to recognize fine-grained activity information such as state, direction, rate, count, and usage based on the characteristics of radar responses. We conducted studies for multiple instrumented objects in both indoor and outdoor environments, with promising results demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Recent developments in immersive imaging technologies have enabled improved telepresence applications. Being fully matured in the commercial sense, omnidirectional (360-degree) content provides full vision around the camera with three degrees of freedom (3DoF). Considering the applications in real-time immersive telepresence, this paper investigates how a single omnidirectional image (ODI) can be used to extend 3DoF to 6DoF. To achieve this, we propose a fully learning-based method for spherical light field reconstruction from a single omnidirectional image. The proposed LFSphereNet utilizes two different networks: The first network learns to reconstruct the light field in cubemap projection (CMP) format given the six cube faces of an omnidirectional image and the corresponding cube face positions as input. The cubemap format implies a linear re-projection, which is more appropriate for a neural network. The second network refines the reconstructed cubemaps in equirectangular projection (ERP) format by removing cubemap border artifacts. The network learns the geometric features implicitly for both translation and zooming when an appropriate cost function is employed. Furthermore, it runs with very low inference time, which enables real-time applications. We demonstrate that LFSphereNet outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of quality and speed when tested on different synthetic and real world scenes. The proposed method represents a significant step towards achieving real-time immersive remote telepresence experiences.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of communication technology and Internet technology, more and more emerging industries, such as 5G communication, Industry 4.0, automatic driving, Internet of Things and telemedicine, have put forward higher requirements for real-time service transmission with low delay. Traditional Ethernet best-effort service is difficult to guarantee the real-time business, but industrial Ethernet has poor compatibility, not easy to transplant and high cost. As a new generation of Ethernet technology, time-sensitive network has the advantages of high-precision time synchronization, bounded delay and zero jitter, high reliability, high compatibility, and multi-service coexistence, which has received continuous attention from academia and industry, and has potential wide application prospects in many fields such as industrial Internet and mobile prequel. However, many existing scheduling mechanisms have drawbacks. Aiming at the maximum scheduling success rate, this paper proposes and calculates the matching degree between streams and links according to the frame size and period information of known streams, and designs a routing algorithm based on this, pre-screening the paths in the routing set and reducing the search range of the dynamic scheduling algorithm. Finally, the reliability of the model is proved by experiments.},

In this case study, we present an eight-week experiment to evaluate the impact of game elements on the degree of participation in the context of crowdsourced field auditing and sensing.

abstract = {Traffic from interactive applications demanding low latency has become dominant in cellular networks. However, existing schedulers of cellular network base stations fall short in delivering low latency when prior information (i.e., dedicated Quality of Service (QoS)) is unavailable; they become service agnostic and perform towards maximizing the radio resource utilization or user fairness. We identify a new opportunity of providing a better latency for those latency-sensitive traffic flows by additionally taking the Flow Completion Time (FCT) into account in downlink scheduling at the base stations. However, the key challenges are 1) it can bring a severe cost in optimization metrics of the existing scheduler and 2) it should work without prior knowledge of the traffic.To this end, we present OutRAN, a practical flow scheduler designed for Radio Access Network that co-optimizes the FCT and optimization objectives of the cellular scheduler. The resulting system does not require prior information. Through simulation and over-the-air evaluation, we demonstrate that OutRAN outperforms the legacy LTE/5G schedulers in FCT, which leads to the reduction in webpage load time of Android phones.},

Recently, with the development of the gas sensor IC chip, low-cost enose sensing exhaled breath from patients can potentially be used for the first-stage screening in the near future. We propose a share-embedding model combining x-ray images and enose sensory signals to diagnose lung cancer. Our model contains two branches: the image branch and the enose branch. Since the lack of the enose data, we try to use the pretrained image model to guide the enose branch to align toward the embedding space that the image model learned. Our share-embedding model is designed to be robust to domain shifts across devices and environments. To further improve performance, we use semi-supervised learning with instance weighting to transfer the model to the unlabeled target domain. To train and evaluate the performance, we collect the first paired X-ray images and enose data across multiple devices and clinical environments. In the experiments, our method outperforms each individual branch and a feature concatenation fusion method. In the cross-device setting, our method leveraging semi-supervised learning achieves the best performance.},

abstract = {Protecting sensitive information on data streams is a pivotal challenge for modern systems. Current approaches to providing privacy in data streams can be broadly categorized into two strategies. The first strategy involves transforming the stream into a private sequence of values, enabling the subsequent use of non-private methods of analysis. While effective, this approach incurs high memory costs, often proportional to the size of the database. Alternatively, a compact data structure can be used to provide a private summary of the stream. However, these data structures are limited to predefined queries, restricting their flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight synthetic data generator, PrivHP, that provides differential privacy guarantees. PrivHP is based on a novel method for the private hierarchical decomposition of the input domain in bounded memory. As the decomposition approximates the cumulative distribution function of the input, it serves as a lightweight structure for synthetic data generation. PrivHP is the first method to provide a principled trade-off between accuracy and space for private hierarchical decompositions. It achieves this by balancing hierarchy depth, noise addition, and selective pruning of low-frequency subdomains while preserving high-frequency ones, all identified in a privacy-preserving manner. To ensure memory efficiency, we employ private sketches to estimate subdomain frequencies without accessing the entire dataset. Central to our approach is the introduction of a pruning parameter k, which enables an almost smooth interpolation between space usage and utility, and a measure of skew tailk, which is a vector of subdomain frequencies containing all but the largest k coordinates. PrivHP processes a dataset X using M = O(k log2 |X|)) space and, on input domain Ω = [0,1]d, while maintaining ε-differential privacy, produces a synthetic data generator that is at distance O(M(1-1/d)/εn + ||tailk(X)||1/M1/dn) from the empirical distribution in the expected Wasserstein metric. Compared to the state-of-the-art, PMM, which achieves accuracy O ((ε n)-1/d) with memory O(ε n), our method introduces an additional approximation error term of O(||tailk(X)||1/(M1/dn)), but operates in significantly reduced space. Additionally, we provide interpretable utility bounds that account for all error sources, including those introduced by the fixed hierarchy depth, privacy noise, hierarchy pruning, and frequency approximations.},

Here we call it a virtual sensor because it is a software-based representation of a physical sensor. Due to the extensively installed telecommunication fiber-optic cables at the roadside, our system using redundant dark fibers enables to monitor traffic at low cost with low maintenance. Many existing traffic monitoring approaches use cameras, piezoelectric sensors, and smartphones, but they are limited due to privacy concerns and/or deployment requirements. Previous studies attempted to use telecommunication cables for traffic monitoring, but they were only exploratory and limited to simple tasks at a coarse granularity, e.g., vehicle detection, due to their hardware constraints and real-world challenges. In particular, those challenges are 1) unknown and heterogeneous properties of virtual sensors and 2) large and complex noise conditions. To this end, our TelecomTM system first characterizes the geographic location and analyzes the signal pattern of each virtual sensor through driving tests. We then develop a spatial-domain Bayesian filtering and smoothing algorithm to detect, track, and characterize each vehicle. Our approach uses the spatial dependency of multiple virtual sensors and Newton's laws of motion to combine the distributed sensor data to reduce uncertainties in vehicle detection and tracking. In our real-world evaluation on a two-way traffic road with 1120 virtual sensors, TelecomTM achieved 90.18% vehicle detection accuracy, 27x and 5x error reduction for vehicle position and speed tracking compared to a baseline method, and ±3.92% and ±11.98% percent error for vehicle wheelbase and weight estimation, respectively.},

Sensor nodes capture and send the collected data periodically to a gateway via LoRa wireless transmission. When it detects that the manhole cover has shifted above the pre-programmed threshold, it will sound a local buzzer. The network gateway consists of a microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi connectivity and a LoRa transceiver. It takes data from the sensor network and uploads it to the myDevices Cayenne database. The suggested system's purpose is to monitor the status of manhole cover opening and closing in real-time at a reasonable cost. Research results can be used to aid in the management and warning of manhole cover loss in order to reduce property damage and its impact on human life.},

As a well-established and cost-effective renewable energy technology, it not only produces power but also supports significant water management services. The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in hydropower plants has shown significant potential in enhancing monitoring, efficiency, and control capabilities. However, current implementations often lack a holistic and standardized approach to contextual modeling. To address this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive approach to modeling the structural and operational components of hydropower plants (HPPs) using NGSI-LD data models. We propose detailed NGSI-LD data models that incorporate both static properties (e.g., location, structural attributes), relationships (e.g., component interactions, hierarchical dependencies) and dynamic properties (e.g., real-time sensor data, operational status). These models are designed to facilitate efficient data integration, support decision-making processes, and enable the development of interoperable and replicable IoT applications for smart hydropower plants. We validate our approach through deployment and testing on a federated context broker architecture using real-world data from HPPs.},

Motivated by the above, this article introduces a low-cost ozone and UV-C light-emission portable device to satisfy the growing demand for disinfection of enclosed and unoccupied spaces.&nbsp;gLAMP, the&nbsp;proposal of this work, offers users a safe-to-use disinfection process by incorporating a pair of sensors into the design to measure air quality, keep users out of the risk area and streamline the ozone diffusion and ventilation processes in the area to be disinfected. As well as a mobile application to control and monitor the equipment and disinfection service remotely. Preliminary tests were carried out to verify the functionality of&nbsp;gLAMP&nbsp;and its potential commercial impact.},

abstract = {Emerging device-free sensing technologies and applications promote the development of indoor ubiquitous sensing. Device-free sensing with machine learning mechanisms enable detection, recognition automatically, without required explicit programming. Because of concern of indoor sensing privacy and ubiquitous sensing ability, it is really necessary to conduct an in-depth survey on device-free sensing security training and cross-domain sensing issues. Existing surveys have two important problems: weak robustness and low efficiency. To address them, this article put forward to learn domain independent features, model training and inference localization based on federated transfer learning. Moreover, several efficient methods are proposed to provide a distributed edge device-free sensing mechanism with sensing data privacy protection, low time cost, communication, computing and energy resources. We implement the proposed mechanism and carry out experiments with Widar3.0 datasets to evaluate its performance. The results demonstrate that our mechanism performs better for cross-domain device-free sensing while preserving user data privacy and saving resources.},

abstract = {Air quality monitoring sensor networks focusing on air pollution measure pollutants that are regulated by the authorities, such as CO, NO2, NO, SO2, O3, and particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5). However, there are other pollutants, such as black carbon (BC), which are not regulated, have a major impact on health, and are rarely measured. One solution is to use proxies, which consist of creating a mathematical model that infers the measurement of the pollutant from indirect measurements of other pollutants. In this paper, we propose a robust machine learning proxy (RMLP) framework for estimating BC based on nonlinear machine learning methods, calibrating the low-cost sensors (LCSs), and adding robustness against noise and data missing in the LCS. We show the impact of LCS data aggregation, denoising and missing imputation on BC estimation, and how the concentrations estimated by the BC proxy approximate the values obtained by a reference instrument with an accurate BC sensor.},

abstract = {In the United States, overall air quality has steadily improved since the passage of the Clean Air Act of 1970. However, not all communities have realized these gains and reported air quality can differ significantly between communities. One approach to improve awareness is to add additional regulatory sensors to provide more fine-grained sensing. However, regulatory sensors are expensive and may not be an affordable option. To provide fine-grained sensing and localized air quality, low-cost sensors that detect particulate matter have become an affordable option. Combined with an Internet of Things (IoT) platform, these sensors can provide real-time data to communities. This paper presents findings from a pilot deployment of an IoT air quality sensor network in Slavic Village within Cleveland, Ohio. Through this research, we share our findings and lessons learned from deploying these sensors in partnership with a community partner. From a pilot deployment, we are able to determine a significant difference between two locations that are less than 4 miles apart, supporting the need for fine-grained air quality monitoring. We discuss challenges in deploying in urban environments where both power and connectivity are constraints and how future work will reduce both of these constraints.},

abstract = {In the Internet of Things era, where we see many interconnected and heterogeneous mobile and fixed smart devices, distributing the intelligence from the cloud to the edge has become a necessity. Due to limited computational and communication capabilities, low memory and limited energy budget, bringing artificial intelligence algorithms to peripheral devices, such as end-nodes of a sensor network, is a challenging task and requires the design of innovative solutions. In this work, we present PhiNets, a new scalable backbone optimized for deep-learning-based image processing on resource-constrained platforms. PhiNets are based on inverted residual blocks specifically designed to decouple the computational cost, working memory, and parameter memory, thus exploiting all available resources for a given platform. With a YoloV2 detection head and Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT), the proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art results in (i) detection on the COCO and VOC2012 benchmarks, and (ii) tracking on the MOT15 benchmark. PhiNets obtain a reduction in parameter count of around 90% with respect to previous state-of-the-art models (EfficientNetv1, MobileNetv2) and achieve better performance with lower computational cost. Moreover, we demonstrate our approach on a prototype node based on an STM32H743 microcontroller (MCU) with 2 MB of internal Flash and 1MB of RAM and achieve power requirements in the order of 10 mW. The code for the PhiNets is publicly available on GitHub.1},

abstract = {Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on the multivariate time-series anomaly detection task by learning relationships between variables (sensors). However, they show limitations in capturing temporal dependencies due to lack of sufficient consideration on the characteristics of time to their graph structure. Several studies constructed a time-oriented graph, where each node represents a timestamp within a certain sliding window, to model temporal dependencies, but they failed to learn the trend of changes in time-series. This paper proposes Dual time-oriented Graph ATtention networks (DuoGAT) that resolves the aforementioned problems. Unlike previous work that uses the simple complete undirected structure for time-oriented graphs, our work models directed graphs with weighted edges that only connect from prior events to posterior events, and the edges that connect nearby events are given higher weights. In addition, another time-oriented graph is used to model time series stationary via differencing, which especially focuses on capturing the series of changes. Empirically, our method outperformed the existing state-of-the-art work with the highest F1-score for the four real-world dataset while maintaining low training cost. We also proposed a novel explanation method for anomaly detection using DuoGAT, which provides time-oriented reasoning via hierarchically tracking time points critical in a specific anomaly detection.

abstract = {Pine is one of the important forest tree species in China, with a wide distribution and significant economic value, accounting for over 70% of China's artificial forest area. However, due to the rapid spread of pine wilt disease, a large number of pine resources have been damaged, seriously affecting ecological civilization. The most effective method currently is to promptly detect and accurately locate pine trees infected with pine wilt disease (diseased trees). Manual survey and traditional detection method based on satellite remote sensing image have limitations in monitoring complex forest areas. With the advantages of real-time monitoring, low cost, and high spatial resolution, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image has been widely used for agriculture and forestry. Currently, UAV images are mostly used for monitoring diseased trees. To further improve the accuracy of identifying diseased trees, this paper proposes a diseased tree detection method based on improved YOLOv5s network, which combines the YOLOv5s algorithm with Bi-directional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) and Shuffle Attention (SA). In order to demonstrate the role and mutual influence of various modules in the improved YOLOv5s network, the detection results of the improved YOLOv5s algorithm and other algorithms on the same pine wilt disease dataset are compared. The experimental results show that our improved algorithm increased 2.1% in mAP and 6.1% in recall while the quantity of parameter and GFLOPs have only increased by 3.2% and 2.5%, respectively.},

abstract = {Connectivity restoration is essential for ensuring continuous operation in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, existing works lack enough network robustness when suffering from the secondary external damages. In this paper, we propose a novel connectivity restoration scheme to address this problem. This scheme comprises three connectivity mechanisms regarding relay segment selection in different regions. The first one is a data traffic decentralization mechanism, which establishes more transmission paths near the sink for reliability improvement and traffic load balancing. The second one is a segment shape selection mechanism, in which the segments with high-reliability preferably become the relay segments for greater network robustness. The third one is a traffic load transfer mechanism, in which data traffic is transferred from a high-load segment to a low-load segment for balancing energy depletion of the network. The distinctive characteristics of this work are twofold: different regions perform diverse connectivity restoration approaches according to the demand diversity of different regions, and traffic load can be balanced from upstream regions rather than only from downstream regions. Extensive simulation experiments validate the effectiveness and advantages of our proposed scheme in terms of connection cost, network robustness, load balance degree, and network longevity.},

abstract = {This paper demonstrates the development, implementation, and applications of Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). AMRs are becoming increasingly popular as they offer precise and efficient movement of payloads and can perform various tasks, potentially reducing the need for humans to engage in repetitive and arduous work. The AMR is designed with the view that it can potentially be used for educational, research, and development purposes. While there are many mobile robots available on the market, they are often expensive and come with proprietary hardware and software, which impacts the flexibility needed for research and development. To address these issues, we propose an affordable design for AMRs that utilizes ROS and advanced sensors, including LiDAR, Tracking Camera, Depth Camera, and IMU, for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and autonomous navigation. The proposed design can assist researchers by offering a low-cost solution for developing and testing mobile robots with advanced capabilities. The actuator selection and design of robot electronics are also demonstrated. Finally, several applications are shown by incorporating different hardware based on the problem statement.},

abstract = {Localization is one of the key aspect of any automated navigation system, it means finding own position in a given environment, without it an agent might get lost. In a dynamic environment localization is a very difficult task because various factors such as weather and illumination may change over time. We developed a low-cost solution to the localization problem, relying only on a camera sensor, without using expensive sensors like lidars. The solution allows to handle dynamic nature of the environment and uses previous knowledge for localization, hence it is named as Experience Based Localization. STREET-CNN is a core part of the method which is trained on STREET dataset. This dataset contains several images of streets in IIIT-A along with their GPS coordinates as labels. The trained network calculates the similarity score between the two cross domain images.

abstract = {This article presents universal algorithms for clustering problems, including the widely studied k-median, k-means, and k-center objectives. The input is a metric space containing all potential client locations. The algorithm must select k cluster centers such that they are a good solution for any subset of clients that actually realize. Specifically, we aim for low regret, defined as the maximum over all subsets of the difference between the cost of the algorithm’s solution and that of an optimal solution. A universal algorithm’s solution Sol for a clustering problem is said to be an α , β-approximation if for all subsets of clients C′, it satisfies sol (C′) ≤ α undefined opt (C′) + β undefined mr, where opt (C′ is the cost of the optimal solution for clients (C′) and mr is the minimum regret achievable by any solution.Our main results are universal algorithms for the standard clustering objectives of k-median, k-means, and k-center that achieve (O(1), O(1))-approximations. These results are obtained via a novel framework for universal algorithms using linear programming (LP) relaxations. These results generalize to other ℓp-objectives and the setting where some subset of the clients are fixed. We also give hardness results showing that (α, β)-approximation is NP-hard if α or β is at most a certain constant, even for the widely studied special case of Euclidean metric spaces. This shows that in some sense, (O(1), O(1))-approximation is the strongest type of guarantee obtainable for universal clustering.},

These parameters include the fixed weight of the power system, generator power generation efficiency, and total electrical load, all of which influence the fuel cost of an airplane. To simplify the quantitative analysis, the proportions of fuel costs during the cruising phase and block phase influenced by these parameters are analyzed separately. Parameter sensitivity analysis helps designers quickly and easily determine optimization targets during the design process to reduce the fuel cost of an airplane.},

The effectiveness of UAV swarm sensing is determined by the path of each UAV in the swarm.

To achieve this, we propose TRACT, TowaRds lArge-sCale crowdsensing wiTh high-efficiency swarm path planning algorithm. We expand the sensing coverage problem for large-scale modeling. Furthermore, we propose a policy matrix searching technique with a simulated annealing algorithm to address the complexity of long-term planning. Our experiment shows that TRACT adapts to various data requirements, with the performance improved by 90% in terms of KL-divergence between the time-aggregated data value and the data requirements, while time cost for path planning was reduced by 43% compared with the previous state-of-the-art method approach.},

While progress has been made with communication skills training for clinicians, significant gaps exist in how to best monitor, measure, and evaluate the implementation of communication skills in the actual clinical setting. Advancements in ubiquitous technology and natural language processing make it possible to realize more objective, real-time assessment of clinical interactions and in turn provide more timely feedback to clinicians about their communication effectiveness. In this paper, we propose CommSense, a computational sensing framework that combines smartwatch audio and transcripts with natural language processing methods to measure selected "best-practice'' communication metrics captured by wearable devices in the context of palliative care interactions, including understanding, empathy, presence, emotion, and clarity. We conducted a pilot study involving N=40 clinician participants, to test the technical feasibility and acceptability of CommSense in a simulated clinical setting. Our findings demonstrate that CommSense effectively captures most communication metrics and is well-received by both practicing clinicians and student trainees. Our study also highlights the potential for digital technology to enhance communication skills training for healthcare providers and students, ultimately resulting in more equitable delivery of healthcare and accessible, lower cost tools for training with the potential to improve patient outcomes.},

abstract = {Estimation of occupant count in commercial and institutional buildings enables energy experts to make better decisions on which buildings to prioritize for green upgrading and retrofitting from a large building portfolio. A cheap easy-to-install solution will enable energy experts to obtain occupancy estimation by easily scaling to large building portfolios. This paper presents a method for estimating occupancy based on sparse coverage of low-cost IoT sensors. The method is tested on 2 datasets, one academic building in Denmark (DK) and one academic building in Canada (CAN). The datasets contain PIR, CO2 measurements, and electric energy data together with ground truth occupancy counts. We show that 20% sensor coverage is comparable to full sensor coverage (60%) with an NRMSE of 0.142 (DK) and 0.174 (CAN) for 20% sensor coverage and an NRMSE of 0.129 (DK) and 0.163 (CAN) for full sensor coverage. Results show that with less sensor coverage, sensor placement becomes more important and that even with 20% it is possible to get as good of an accuracy as full coverage. The occupant count is used for key performance indicators of the buildings’ energy usage which shows higher energy use per occupant at low occupancy.},

abstract = {Tracking body pose on-the-go could have powerful uses in fitness, mobile gaming, context-aware virtual assistants, and rehabilitation. However, users are unlikely to buy and wear special suits or sensor arrays to achieve this end. Instead, in this work, we explore the feasibility of estimating body pose using IMUs already in devices that many users own — namely smartphones, smartwatches, and earbuds. This approach has several challenges, including noisy data from low-cost commodity IMUs, and the fact that the number of instrumentation points on a user’s body is both sparse and in flux. Our pipeline receives whatever subset of IMU data is available, potentially from just a single device, and produces a best-guess pose. To evaluate our model, we created the IMUPoser Dataset, collected from 10 participants wearing or holding off-the-shelf consumer devices and across a variety of activity contexts. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of our system, benchmarking it on both our own and existing IMU datasets.},

abstract = {Postpartum rehabilitation is one of the issues that pregnant women are very concerned about. In order to facilitate the postpartum rehabilitation nursing of spontaneous parturients, assist the restoration of uterus and save labor cost, this paper designs a non-invasive and easy to operate portable low-frequency pulse postpartum rehabilitation system to help parturients alleviate their physical and mental pressure and reduce their postpartum discomfort. The system uses stm32f103rct6 as the core controller, takes the belt as the carrier, and combines the pressure control module, temperature control module and low-frequency pulse module. The pressure control module is composed of pressure sensor, airbag and air pump. The temperature control module consists of a temperature sensor and a heating plate. STM32 collects the data of each module for analysis and processing, and transmits the data to mobile app or PC through Bluetooth module. The system can not only realize the functions of low-frequency pulse current massage, pelvic pressurization and dew discharge, temperature control and heat preservation, but also be safe, reliable and practical.},

abstract = {Nanodevices with Terahertz (THz)-based wireless communication capabilities are providing a primer for flow-guided localization within the human bloodstreams. Such localization is allowing for assigning the locations of sensed events with the events themselves, providing benefits along the lines of early and precise diagnostics, and reduced costs and invasiveness. Flow-guided localization is still in a rudimentary phase, with only a handful of works targeting the problem. Nonetheless, the performance assessments of the proposed solutions are already carried out in a non-standardized way, usually along a single performance metric, and ignoring various aspects that are relevant at such a scale (e.g., nanodevices' limited energy) and for such a challenging environment (e.g., extreme attenuation of in-body THz propagation). As such, these assessments feature low levels of realism and cannot be compared in an objective way. Toward addressing this issue, we account for the environmental and scale-related peculiarities of the scenario and assess the performance of two state-of-the-art flow-guided localization approaches along a set of heterogeneous performance metrics such as the accuracy and reliability of localization.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of low-cost sensors and the Internet of Things, the rate of producing data far exceeds the compute and storage capabilities of today’s infrastructure. Much of this data takes the form of time series, and in response, there has been increasing interest in the creation of time series archives in the past decade, along with the development and deployment of novel analysis methods to process the data. The general strategy has been to apply a plurality of similarity search mechanisms to various subsets and subsequences of time series data to identify repeated patterns and anomalies; however, the computational demands of these approaches renders them incompatible with today’s power-constrained embedded CPUs.To address this challenge, we present FA-LAMP, an FPGA-accelerated implementation of the Learned Approximate Matrix Profile (LAMP) algorithm, which predicts the correlation between streaming data sampled in real-time and a representative time series dataset used for training. FA-LAMP lends itself as a real-time solution for time series analysis problems such as classification. We present the implementation of FA-LAMP on both edge- and cloud-based prototypes. On the edge devices, FA-LAMP integrates accelerated computation as close as possible to IoT sensors, thereby eliminating the need to transmit and store data in the cloud for posterior analysis. On the cloud-based accelerators, FA-LAMP can execute multiple LAMP models on the same board, allowing simultaneous processing of incoming data from multiple data sources across a network.LAMP employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for prediction. This work investigates the challenges and limitations of deploying CNNs on FPGAs using the Xilinx Deep Learning Processor Unit (DPU) and the Vitis AI development environment. We expose several technical limitations of the DPU, while providing a mechanism to overcome them by attaching custom IP block accelerators to the architecture. We evaluate FA-LAMP using a low-cost Xilinx Ultra96-V2 FPGA as well as a cloud-based Xilinx Alveo U280 accelerator card and measure their performance against a prototypical LAMP deployment running on a Raspberry Pi 3, an Edge TPU, a GPU, a desktop CPU, and a server-class CPU. In the edge scenario, the Ultra96-V2 FPGA improved performance and energy consumption compared to the Raspberry Pi; in the cloud scenario, the server CPU and GPU outperformed the Alveo U280 accelerator card, while the desktop CPU achieved comparable performance; however, the Alveo card offered an order of magnitude lower energy consumption compared to the other four platforms. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/aminiok1/lamp-alveo.},

abstract = {Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are an alternative computational paradigm to artificial neural networks (ANNs) that have attracted attention due to their event-driven execution mechanisms, enabling extremely low energy consumption. However, a significant challenge and opportunity in SNNs is to optimize memory and compute costs while maintaining accuracy, thereby further reducing energy consumption. Model quantization has been proposed as a promising technique to improve the running efficiency via the number of data bits reduction. Whereas, this technique has yet to be well studied in the neuromorphic computing domain. The underlying reason is that the behaviors of SNNs are quite different from those of ANNs, making 1) the accuracy of SNNs usually sensitive to data precision, and 2) the introduction of a temporal dimension to characterize neuronal dynamics. In this paper, we present NeuronQuant, an accurate and energy-efficient quantization framework to reduce the precision of neurons while maintaining accuracy. The key insight is to design a post-training quantization method guided by the activity of neurons, efficiently reducing the bit-width of parameters based on local relationships within neurons. Additionally, a budget-aware mixed bit-width allocation strategy for the total model size enables the adaptive growth and narrowing of precision in each layer, leading to a mixed-precision quantization scheme of the desired size. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that NeuronQuant can achieve a compressed SNN with 5.2 bits on average and 1.51\texttimes{} power consumption reduction with a superior model accuracy which is quite impressive for SNN.

abstract = {Virtual devices based on device emulation have been widely used in lab research of mobile app testing for their efficiency and low cost. However, it remains controversial to use virtual devices for app testing in industry, given the inherent difficulties of high-fidelity emulation across diverse mobile systems and devices. Hence, mobile app companies still rely on physical device farms or services like AWS Device Farm.This paper presents our effort to analyze, improve, and effectively use virtual devices for large-scale testing of mobile apps like Douyin. Our goal is to understand the fidelity of virtual devices and to explore how to better utilize virtual devices to improve the efficiency and accessibility of mobile app testing in industrial settings. Our study is conducted on a massive commercial testing infrastructure that deploys a physical device farm and its virtualized counterpart.We show that high-fidelity app testing can be achieved by sensible design and implementation of virtual device farms. With that, we find that major discrepancies are no longer caused by commonly believed factors like hardware heterogeneity and system customizations, but due to non-standard, uncoordinated, and occasionally defective vendor-specific services and drivers, as well as defense mechanisms against malicious app behavior. We present effective solutions to address those problems to significantly improve testing fidelity. We also share our experiences of using virtual device farms to substantially improve the efficiency and accessibility of mobile app testing, without compromising safety.},

abstract = {Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its potential applications in healthcare, smart homes, and security. Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) is a promising sensor modality for HAR, providing a device-free and low-cost solution. However, building environment-independent models for HAR using Wi-Fi CSI remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based activity recognition system that exploits CSI measurements obtained from one or more environments to deliver consistent and accurate performance even in unseen environments. Our system employs a multi-task learning approach that is based on an encoder-decoder network architecture. This enables the encoder part of this architecture to mitigate the environment-dependent factors and extract a rich and environment-invariant representation. To evaluate the proposed system, we collected CSI samples for six activities pursued by three participants in four distinct environments. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system in achieving environment-independent HAR with an average accuracy of 80%. Additionally, the results validate the superiority of our method over environment-specific models by a minimum margin of 6% in cases of limited data.},

In addition, the ‘plug and play’ and ‘mix and match’ functionality of LegoSENSE makes the sensor modules reusable, and allows them to be mixed and matched to serve a variety of needs. We show, through a series of user studies, that LegoSENSE enables users without engineering background to deploy a wide range of applications up to 9 \texttimes{} faster than experienced engineers without the use of LegoSENSE. We open-source the hardware and software designs to foster an ever-evolving community, enabling IoT applications for enthusiasts, students, scientists, and researchers across various application domains with or without prior experiences with embedded platforms or coding.},

abstract = {Embedded devices are increasingly ubiquitous and their importance is hard to overestimate. While they often support safety-critical functions (e.g., in medical devices and sensor-alarm combinations), they are usually implemented under strict cost/energy budgets, using low-end microcontroller units (MCUs) that lack sophisticated security mechanisms. Motivated by this issue, recent work developed architectures capable of generating Proofs of Execution (PoX) for the correct/expected software in potentially compromised low-end MCUs. In practice, this capability can be leveraged to provide "integrity from birth" to sensor data, by binding the sensed results/outputs to an unforgeable cryptographic proof of execution of the expected sensing process. Despite this significant progress, current PoX schemes for low-end MCUs ignore the real-time needs of many applications. In particular, security of current PoX schemes precludes any interrupts during the execution being proved. We argue that lack of asynchronous capabilities (i.e., interrupts within PoX) can obscure PoX usefulness, as several applications require processing real-time and asynchronous events. To bridge this gap, we propose, implement, and evaluate an Architecture for Secure Asynchronous Processing in PoX (ASAP). ASAP is secure under full software compromise, enables asynchronous PoX, and incurs less hardware overhead than prior work.},

abstract = {MRI currently is the most powerful medical diagnostic tomography system. It provides high resolution with high detail medical image. Its magnetization sensing is also free from radiation impact hence safe for the patient. However, the data acquisition process takes quite a long time with high-rate sampling. The sensing patient should stay still in the MRI sensing device for 20 to 40 minutes. It can affect claustrophobia for some patients. The high-rate sampling will also linearly affect the cost, which is considerably high. Hence, the research on enabling under-sampling MRI imaging has been raised. The main objective of under-sampling MRI Imaging is reducing the scanning time by under-sampling the data acquisition while at the same time the resulting qualified reconstructed image can be maintained. Compressive Sensing (CS) framework is one of the approaches that can be utilized on solving projection with less measurement. It can recover signals which have sparsity property. The signal is sparse if the signal being sensed has low information rate. Thus, the framework of Compressive Sensing matches under-sampling MRI Imaging. The sparsity requirement is closely related to the design of sensing matrix and dictionary on the Compressive Sensing framework. This paper presents analysis of two proposed sensing matrix designs for Under-sampling MRI Imaging: square sensing matrix and sorting-based sensing matrix designs. The proposed sensing matrix design is intended to appropriately sample the data measurement on certain sampling rate in frequency domain to maintain the quality of the reconstructed MRI image closely to the ground truth (full sampling MRI Imaging). The simulations show that both proposed sensing matrix designs are able to conduct under-sampling MRI Imaging for at least at 40% sampling rate with average of PSNR 27.72 and 33.07 respectively subject to the ground truth.},

abstract = {Intracranial aneurysm refers to a neoplastic protrusion of the arterial wall caused by a localized abnormal enlargement of the cerebral artery lumen. In clinical practice, patients in the early stage of onset generally have no obvious symptoms, which is very easy to miss diagnosis. In medicine, methods such as MRA, CTA and DSA can be used to display the images of blood vessels. Among them, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has the advantages of low cost and small damage to the human body. Which can display the images of blood vessels in the brain. The data set used herein was based on images provided by a three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography system. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) We improved a classic 3D U-Net model with the combination of attention gate, residual connection, and the changes of size. Which achieved automatic segmentation of aneurysms in MRA. In the detection of aneurysms with mean diameters of 6.10mm and 7.69mm, the sensitivity was 83.4% and 86.4% respectively. (2) On the basis of this sensitivity, we achieved a low false positive rate which was 0.36 FPs/case and 0.34 FPs/case respectively.CCS CONCEPTS • Computing methodologies∼Computer graphics∼Image manipulation∼Image processing},

abstract = {Ensuring relative consistency in executing temporal queries to access real-time sensor data streams maintained in a database is a challenging problem, particularly when data transmission delays are lengthy and highly variable. Due to the unordered arrivals of sensor data, the databases may contain numerous open data versions (ODVs) with undefined validity intervals. Accessing ODVs may violate the relative consistency requirements of temporal queries, resulting in incorrect results. Although the Re-execution with Every Update (REU) method can resolve this issue, it may introduce heavy re-execution costs and significant delays in query completion. In this article, we study the problem of retrieving data items with temporal consistency requirements in a multi-data-stream database. To balance response time and meet the relative consistency requirements of queries, we introduce an enhanced REU mechanism called Re-Execution with Deadline (RED). Moreover, we propose a novel optional mechanism called Backward Execution Option (BEO) for temporal queries to achieve relative consistency in their execution with quick results by relaxing the data freshness constraints. By combining RED with BEO, we formulate the Repeated BEO (RBEO) to further reduce the query response time. We extend the timestamped key-value store MVLevelDB into MVLevelDB+ to implement the proposed mechanisms. To reduce the query re-execution cost as required in RED and REU, we designed the Query Pool with Execution State (QpES) mechanism to achieve relative consistency in query execution with lower checking overhead and only one re-execution. We conducted extensive evaluation experiments on MVLevelDB+ using benchmark programs to illustrate their performance characteristics on handling temporal queries in the modeled IoT system.},

abstract = {In modern mobile applications, users frequently encounter various new contexts, necessitating on-device continual learning (CL) to ensure consistent model performance. While existing research predominantly focused on developing lightweight CL frameworks, we identify that data scarcity is a critical bottleneck for on-device CL. In this work, we explore the potential of leveraging abundant cloud-side data to enrich scarce on-device data, and propose a private, efficient and effective data enrichment framework Delta. Specifically, Delta first introduces a directory dataset to decompose the data enrichment problem into device-side and cloud-side sub-problems without sharing sensitive data. Next, Delta proposes a soft data matching strategy to effectively solve the device-side sub-problem with sparse user data, and an optimal data sampling scheme for cloud server to retrieve the most suitable dataset for enrichment with low computational complexity. Further, Delta refines the data sampling scheme by jointly considering the impact of enriched data on both new and past contexts, mitigating the catastrophic forgetting issue from a new aspect. Comprehensive experiments across four typical mobile computing tasks with varied data modalities demonstrate that Delta could enhance the overall model accuracy by an average of 15.1%, 12.4%, 1.1% and 5.6% for visual, IMU, audio and textual tasks compared with few-shot CL, and consistently reduce the communication costs by over 90% compared to federated CL.},

abstract = {The rapid growth of megacities has led to higher levels of air pollution in cities. To supplement fixed air quality monitoring sites, the megacities offer an unprecedented opportunity to deploy air quality sensors on public transportation systems, and thus enable air quality monitoring at different locations in the city within the routes of the transport means. In this paper, we leverage this opportunity and show the feasibility of deploying air quality sensors on the means of the transport system by installing three low-cost sensors on three trams that operate on three different routes in the city of Helsinki. Our measurement campaign took place during the summer and autumn of 2019, during which we measured main traffic pollutants and meteorological variables. Specifically, we show the variability of pollution levels in different locations using pollution hotspots captured by one of the sensors for two of the main air pollutants. That is, we demonstrate the potential of deploying the sensors on public transport systems and show the feasibility and effectiveness of such an approach for pollution hotspot detection; this can enable real-time air quality information streaming, and thus contribute to the cities' air quality repositories used for the public.},

abstract = {Eavesdropping on human voice is one of the most common but harmful threats to personal privacy. Glasses are in direct contact with human face, which could sense facial motions when users speak, so human speech contents could be inferred by sensing the movements of glasses. In this paper, we present a live voice eavesdropping method, RF-Mic, which utilizes common glasses attached with a low-cost RFID tag to sense subtle facial speech dynamics for inferring possible voice contents. When a user with a glasses, which is attached an RFID tag on the glass bridge, is speaking, RF-Mic first collects RF signals through forward propagation and backscattering. Then, body motion interference is eliminated from the collected RF signals through a proposed Conditional Denoising AutoEncoder (CDAE) network. Next, RF-Mic extracts three kinds of facial speech dynamic features (i.e., facial movements, bone-borne vibrations, and airborne vibrations) by designing three different deep-learning models. Based on the extracted features, a facial speech dynamics model is constructed for live voice eavesdropping. Extensive experiments in different real environments demonstrate that RF-Mic can achieve robust and accurate human live voice eavesdropping.},

abstract = {Road surface information (e.g., smooth road or bumpy road with potholes or bumps) is important for safe driving (i.e., it's necessary to be aware of the road surface conditions during driving). However, the high-cost sensor (e.g., LiDAR and camera) based road surface sensing approaches cannot work properly in inclement weather conditions (e.g., fogging and snowing) due to the line-of-sight requirement. The low-cost and ubiquitous smartphone-based road surface sensing approach is not reliable and safe to use, since it relies on the vibration of the vehicle body to sense the road surface (i.e., the vehicle's tires need to touch the bumps on the road surface). Can we automate the contact-free road surface sensing with low-cost sensors for safe driving without requiring the vehicle's tires to touch the bumps on the road surface?In this paper, we propose Tago, a system that can achieve contact-free road surface sensing with commodity passive RFID tags. Instead of deploying RFID tags or readers along the road or lamp post (i.e., infrastructure-based deployment), we deploy the reader inside of the vehicle and attach the tag and the reader's antenna at the front end of the vehicle like the vehicle's headlights (i.e., infrastructure-free deployment). However, there is a great challenge to obtain the clean reflection from the road surface, since the reflection may be drown in the backscattered signals due to multipath effect. Moreover, it is not reliable to use the composite signals received at the reader to sense the road surface conditions. Therefore, we first comprehensively analyse the variation of composite signals received at the reader. Then, we propose a signal cancellation approach to extract the clean reflections from the road surface, such that we can accurately sense the road surface conditions for safe driving. Our experiments with different vehicles (e.g., Honda Civic Frankenfish, Folsom, Flutter and CR-V Warner) driven on different roadways (e.g., urban and residential area) show that Tago can effectively sense the road surface information.},

abstract = {There have been increasing interests in exploring the sensing capabilities of RFID to enable numerous IoT applications, including object localization, trajectory tracking, and human behavior sensing. However, most existing methods rely on the signal measurement either in a low multipath environment, which is unlikely to exist in many practical situations, or with special devices, which increase the operating cost. This paper investigates the possibility of measuring ‘multi-path-free’ signal information in multipath-prevalent environments simply using a commodity RFID reader. The proposed solution, Clean Physical Information Extraction (CPIX), is universal, accurate, and compatible to standard protocols and devices. CPIX improves RFID sensing quality with near zero cost – it requires no extra device. We implement CPIX and study three major RFID sensing applications: tag localization, device calibration and human behavior sensing. CPIX reduces the localization error by 30% to 50% and achieves the MOST accurate localization by commodity readers compared to existing work. It also significantly improves the quality of device calibration and human behaviour sensing.},

The proportion of older pregnant women is rising rapidly. The birth risks such as premature birth, abortion, gestational diabetes and hypertension are greatly increased, which brings new challenges to the quality of birth and the health of pregnant women. In particular, the incidence of premature infants increased year by year. Premature infants not only have a low survival rate, but also are likely to have intellectual problems. It is urgent to pay attention to the care of pregnant women and improve the birth quality of babies. This paper studies and designs a home convenient pregnant women care system based on sensor data analysis which involved Arduino board, relevant sensors and the software system. The system has the advantages of convenient use, multi-function, low cost and customizable. It can detect the ambient temperature and humidity, user's heart rhythm, harmful gas leakage, blood oxygen saturation, etc. The system also has some additional functions, such as first-aid skills for pregnant women, psychological counseling for pregnant women, fetal education music, and recipes for pregnant women, which are designed to reduce the burden and worry of pregnant women.},

abstract = {Testing deep neural networks (DNNs) has garnered great interest in the recent years due to their use in many applications. Black-box test adequacy measures are useful for guiding the testing process in covering the input domain. However, the absence of input specifications makes it challenging to apply black-box test adequacy measures in DNN testing. The Input Distribution Coverage (IDC) framework addresses this challenge by using a variational autoencoder to learn a low dimensional latent representation of the input distribution, and then using that latent space as a coverage domain for testing. IDC applies combinatorial interaction testing on a partitioning of the latent space to measure test adequacy. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that IDC is cost-effective, capable of detecting feature diversity in test inputs, and more sensitive than prior work to test inputs generated using different DNN test generation methods. The findings demonstrate that IDC overcomes several limitations of white-box DNN coverage approaches by discounting coverage from unrealistic inputs and enabling the calculation of test adequacy metrics that capture the feature diversity present in the input space of DNNs.},

In this article, we propose RL-MAC, a Reinforcement Learning (RL)–based Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol for multimedia sensing in an Underwater Acoustic Network (UAN) environment. The proposed scheme uses Transmission Opportunity (TXOP) for relay nodes in a multi-hop network for improved efficiency concerning the mobility of the relays and sensor nodes. The access point (AP) and relay nodes calculate traffic demands from the initial contention of the sensor nodes. Our solution uses Q-learning to enhance the contention mechanism at the initial phase of multimedia transmission. Based on the traffic demands, RL-MAC allocates TXOP duration for the uplink multimedia reception. Further, the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and compression techniques are used for calculating the image quality at the receiver end and reducing the image at the destination, respectively. We implement a prototype of the proposed scheme over an off-the-shelf, low-cost hardware setup. Moreover, extensive simulation over NS-3 shows a significant packet delivery ratio and throughput compared with the existing state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) collaborative perception is crucial for the advancement of autonomous driving. However, achieving high-precision V2X perception requires a significant amount of annotated real-world data, which can always be expensive and hard to acquire. Simulated data have raised much attention since they can be massively produced at an extremely low cost. Nevertheless, the significant domain gap between simulated and real-world data, including differences in sensor type, reflectance patterns, and road surroundings, often leads to poor performance of models trained on simulated data when evaluated on real-world data. In addition, there remains a domain gap between real-world collaborative agents, e.g. different types of sensors may be installed on autonomous vehicles and roadside infrastructures with different extrinsics, further increasing the difficulty of sim2real generalization. To take full advantage of simulated data, we present a new unsupervised sim2real domain adaptation method for V2X collaborative detection named Decoupled Unsupervised Sim2Real Adaptation (DUSA). Our new method decouples the V2X collaborative sim2real domain adaptation problem into two sub-problems: sim2real adaptation and inter-agent adaptation. For sim2real adaptation, we design a Location-adaptive Sim2Real Adapter (LSA) module to adaptively aggregate features from critical locations of the feature map and align the features between simulated data and real-world data via a sim/real discriminator on the aggregated global feature. For inter-agent adaptation, we further devise a Confidence-aware Inter-agent Adapter (CIA) module to align the fine-grained features from heterogeneous agents under the guidance of agent-wise confidence maps. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DUSA approach on unsupervised sim2real adaptation from the simulated V2XSet dataset to the real-world DAIR-V2X-C dataset.},

abstract = {Embodied intelligence empowers agents with a profound sense of perception, enabling them to respond in a manner closely aligned with real-world situations. Large Language Models (LLMs) delve into language instructions with depth, serving a crucial role in generating plans for intricate tasks. Thus, LLM-based embodied models further enhance the agent's capacity to comprehend and process information. However, this amalgamation also ushers in new challenges in the pursuit of heightened intelligence. Specifically, attackers can manipulate LLMs to produce irrelevant or even malicious outputs by altering their prompts. Confronted with this challenge, we observe a notable absence of multi-modal datasets essential for comprehensively evaluating the robustness of LLM-based embodied models. Consequently, we construct the Embodied Intelligent Robot Attack Dataset (EIRAD), tailored specifically for robustness evaluation. Additionally, two attack strategies are devised, including untargeted attacks and targeted attacks, to effectively simulate a range of diverse attack scenarios. At the same time, during the attack process, to more accurately ascertain whether our method is successful in attacking the LLM-based embodied model, we devise a new attack success evaluation method utilizing the BLIP2 model. Recognizing the time and cost-intensive nature of the GCG algorithm in attacks, we devise a scheme for prompt suffix initialization based on various target tasks, thus expediting the convergence process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits a superior attack success rate when targeting LLM-based embodied models, indicating a lower level of decision-level robustness in these models.},

Mostly facilitated by sparsely deployed Air Quality Monitoring Stations (AQMSs) that are difficult to install and maintain, the overall spatial variation heavily impacts air quality monitoring for locations far enough from these pre-deployed public infrastructures. To mitigate this, we in this article propose a framework named AQuaMoHo that can annotate data obtained from a low-cost thermo-hygrometer (as the sole physical sensing device) with the AQI labels, with the help of additional publicly crawled Spatio-temporal information of that locality. At its core, AQuaMoHo exploits the temporal patterns from a set of readily available spatial features using an LSTM-based model and further enhances the overall quality of the annotation using temporal attention. From a thorough study of two different cities, we observe that AQuaMoHo can significantly help annotate the air quality data on a personal scale.},

abstract = {Sound source localization is vital for daily tasks such as communication or navigating environments. However, millions of adults struggle with hearing impairment, which limits their ability to identify the direction and distance of sound sources. Traditional methods for sound spatial sensing, such as microphone arrays, are not suitable for resource-constrained IoT devices like smartphones due to power consumption or hardware complexity. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes EarCase, an alternative scheme that utilizes commercial smartphones with only two microphones to recognize 3D acoustic spatial information. EarCase draws inspiration from the human auditory system, where two ears amplify minute differences in acoustic signals to help pinpoint sound sources. This ability can be regarded as a response function trained through a large amount of sound source information, which can be used to extract spectral cues from a sound source position to the ears drums. We imitate this effect by designing a smartphone case with perforated mini-structures covering the microphones to help the smartphone infer the location of the sound source. Sound waves that pass through the mini-structure will undergo unique changes in diffraction at the hole, amplifying directional information similar to ears. Our scheme uses the top and bottom microphones to eliminate noises and multi-path effects, making the design robust to different sound sources in varying environments. By using only built-in microphones and low-cost phone cases, EarCase provides an accessible tool to enhance the quality of life for hearing impaired individuals. Extensive experimental results show that EarCase achieves high accuracy in localizing sounds, with a mean error of 3.7° at a distance of 200cm and 96% accuracy for real-world sounds (e.g., car horns).},

There are different kinds of sensors that can directly obtain 3D depth information. However, the commonly used Lidar sensor is expensive, and the effective range of RGB-D cameras is limited. In the field of computer vision, researchers have done a lot of work on 3D perception. While traditional geometric algorithms require a lot of manual features for depth estimation, Deep Learning methods have achieved great success in this field. In this work, we proposed a novel self-supervised method based on Vision Transformer (ViT) with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, which is referred to as ViT-Depth. The image reconstruction losses computed by the estimated depth and motion between adjacent frames are treated as supervision signal to establish a self-supervised learning pipeline. This is an effective solution for tasks that need accurate and low-cost 3D perception, such as autonomous driving, robotic navigation, 3D reconstruction, and so on. Our method could leverage both the ability of CNN and Transformer to extract deep features and capture global contextual information. In addition, we propose a cross-frame loss that could constrain photometric error and scale consistency among multi-frames, which lead the training process to be more stable and improve the performance. Extensive experimental results on autonomous driving dataset demonstrate the proposed approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art depth and motion estimation methods.},

But conventional failure analysis methods rely on time series-based fault detection classification to identify the cause of failure, and have limitations in relying on experts for appropriate actions. We present a fully deployed autonomous maintenance system that closes the failure recovery loop, from detecting anomalies to executing corrective actions, by integrating graph-based log analysis, LLM-based semantic reasoning and hybrid retrieval mechanisms. Deployed across 762 photolithography equipment at Samsung Electronics fab from 2021 to 2025, the system handled over 85,000 real-world breakdowns, reduced Mean Time to Recovery by 7 minutes on average.

abstract = {Bluetooth is a pervasive technology for wireless communication. Billions of devices use it in sensitive applications and to exchange private data. The security of Bluetooth depends on the Bluetooth standard and its two security mechanisms: pairing and session establishment. No prior work, including the standard itself, analyzed the future and forward secrecy guarantees of these mechanisms, e.g., if Bluetooth pairing and session establishment defend past and future sessions when the adversary compromises the current. To address this gap, we present six novel attacks, defined as the BLUFFS attacks, breaking Bluetooth sessions' forward and future secrecy. Our attacks enable device impersonation and machine-in-the-middle across sessions by only compromising one session key. The attacks exploit two novel vulnerabilities that we uncover in the Bluetooth standard related to unilateral and repeatable session key derivation. As the attacks affect Bluetooth at the architectural level, they are effective regardless of the victim's hardware and software details (e.g., chip, stack, version, and security mode).We also release BLUFFS, a low-cost toolkit to perform and automatically check the effectiveness of our attacks. The toolkit employs seven original patches to manipulate and monitor Bluetooth session key derivation by dynamically patching a closed-source Bluetooth firmware that we reverse-engineered. We show that our attacks have a critical and large-scale impact on the Bluetooth ecosystem, by evaluating them on seventeen diverse Bluetooth chips (eighteen devices) from popular hardware and software vendors and supporting the most popular Bluetooth versions. Motivated by our empirical findings, we develop and successfully test an enhanced key derivation function for Bluetooth that stops by-design our six attacks and their four root causes. We show how to effectively integrate our fix into the Bluetooth standard and discuss alternative implementation-level mitigations. We responsibly disclosed our contributions to the Bluetooth SIG.},

abstract = {Energy harvesting (EH) devices without batteries can enable the Internet of Things (IoT) to reach new and challenging scenarios. Multihop routing is needed to extend the range but, when low EH causes intermittency, it has been overlooked and is not possible with existing protocols. Also, whilst wake-up receivers (WuRxs) have been used to enable star networks, the cost of another EH node sending wake-ups, required for multihop communication, has not been considered. This paper adapts the opportunistic RPL (ORPL) protocol to make possible multihop routing between intermittently-powered devices. Furthermore, the benefit of using WuRx to enable networks is measured, considering different sensitivity devices and associated range. Comparing ORPL to RPL, we show that opportunistic routing enables multihop communication where RPL cannot. If WuRx are used for routing towards a central hub, the more sensitive WuRx perform better, but routing cross-network benefits from lower sensitivity, lower power WuRx.},

abstract = {Authentication mechanisms deployed on access control systems undertake the responsibility of judging user identity to prevent unauthorized individuals from illegally approaching. In this article, we propose LIPAuth leveraging hand-dependent Light Intensity Pattern to Authenticate users. To be specific, lights released by a screen, are blocked and reflected by one hand above it; in this propagation process, hands exhibit user-specific ability in driving light absorption and attenuation due to owning unique structures, thereby outputting discriminative intensity patterns representing user identity. To implement LIPAuth, we first study the impact of screen contents on light intensity patterns, also explore the possibility of embedding hand structure biometrics into these patterns. We then design a customized dynamic stimulus-response mechanism for LIPAuth and make it resilient to the risks of potential registration profile leakage. Subsequently, we construct a joint pipeline consisting of signal processing and a learning-based generative adversarial network to overcome interference from variable user behaviors. More importantly, LIPAuth just utilizes common sensors to capture light signals, hence achieving low cost. We finally conduct extensive experiments in three scenarios to evaluate the authentication performance of LIPAuth prototype.},

abstract = {The rising popularity of Vehicle-to-Network (V2N) applications is driven by the Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) service offered by 5G. The availability of distributed resources could be leveraged to handle the enormous traffic arising from these applications, but introduces complexity in deciding where to steer traffic under the stringent delay requirements of URLLC. In this paper, we introduce the V2N Computation Offloading and CPU Activation (V2N-COCA) problem, which aims at finding the computation offloading and the edge/cloud CPU activation decisions that minimize the operational costs, both monetary and energetic, under stringent latency constraints. Some challenges are the proven non-monotonicity of the objective function w.r.t. offloading decisions, and the no-existence of closed-formulas for the sojourn time of tasks. We present a provably tight approximation for the latter, and we design BiQui, a provably asymptotically optimal and with linear computational complexity w.r.t. computing resources algorithm for the V2N-COCA problem. We assess BiQui over real-world vehicular traffic traces, performing a sensitivity analysis and a stress-test. Results show that BiQui significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, achieving optimal performance (found through exhaustive searches) in most of the scenarios.},

abstract = {Human activity recognition (HAR) is a time series classification task that focuses on identifying the motion patterns from human sensor readings. Adequate data is essential but a major bottleneck for training a generalizable HAR model, which assists customization and optimization of online web applications. However, it is costly in time and economy to collect large-scale labeled data in reality, i.e., the low-resource challenge. Meanwhile, data collected from different persons have distribution shifts due to different living habits, body shapes, age groups, etc. The low-resource and distribution shift challenges are detrimental to HAR when applying the trained model to new unseen subjects. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Diverse and Discriminative representation Learning (DDLearn) for generalizable low-resource HAR. DDLearn simultaneously considers diversity and discrimination learning. With the constructed self-supervised learning task, DDLearn enlarges the data diversity and explores the latent activity properties. Then, we propose a diversity preservation module to preserve the diversity of learned features by enlarging the distribution divergence between the original and augmented domains. Meanwhile, DDLearn also enhances semantic discrimination by learning discriminative representations with supervised contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on three public HAR datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-art methods by an average accuracy improvement of 9.5% under the low-resource distribution shift scenarios, while being a generic, explainable, and flexible framework.

abstract = {As an important economic crop in China, the planting history of mulberry can be traced back to more than 5,000 years ago. Since the 1970s, Yizhou District, Hechi City, Guangxi Province has begun to establish a special mulberry silkworm production service management agency. Now Yizhou District, Hechi City, Guangxi Province has become an important base for mulberry planting. Mulberry leaves are not only the main feed for sericulture, but also widely used in traditional Chinese medicine and daily life. Mulberry planting technology has also been continuously improved with the changes of the times. Nowadays, with the rapid development of agricultural modernization, traditional planting methods in Yizhou area have also begun to face many challenges, including low planting efficiency, unstable yield, and difficult management of large plantations. These problems directly affect the quality and yield of mulberry leaves, and directly affect the healthy development of sericulture and the economic income of mulberry silkworm farmers. To solve the above problems, this study proposed a method based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and Web Geographic Information System (WebGIS). The system monitors the soil and environmental data of mulberry planting areas in real time, and provides farmers with accurate planting suggestions and decision support after system processing. By using WebGIS technology to map planting plots and sensors and other equipment, it is easier for farmers to manage planting areas. After field deployment and verification in Yizhou area, the system has been proven to effectively improve planting efficiency, stabilize yields, and reduce production costs. In addition, the implementation of the system is also of great significance to improving the sustainability of agricultural ecology. It not only improves the scientific and technological level of regional agriculture, but also provides new research directions and data support for agricultural scientific research. It has good development prospects and practical application value.},

abstract = {The rapid diffusion of hazardous information in large-flow-based social media causes great economic losses and potential threats to society. It is crucial to infer the inner information source as early as possible to prevent further losses. However, existing localization methods wait until all deployed sensors obtain propagation information before starting source inference within a network, and hence the best opportunity to control propagation is missed. In this paper, we propose a new localization strategy based on finite deployed sensors, named Greedy-coverage-based Rapid Source Localization (GRSL), to rapidly, flexibly and accurately infer the source in the early propagation stage of large-scale networks. There are two phases in GRSL. In the first phase, the Greedy-based Strategy (GS) greedily deploys sensors to rapidly achieve wide area coverage at a low cost. In the second phase, when a propagation event within a network is observed by a part of the sensors, the Inference Strategy (IS) with an earlier response mechanism begins executing the source inference task in an earlier small infected area. Comprehensive experiments with the SOTA methods demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of GRSL in various application scenarios.},

This game is used during their mandatory pre-operation safety inspection, a tool that is otherwise nonexistent for their specific needs. The simulator was developed using a game engine and built to operate with different virtual reality headsets. It aims to use a guide to perform inspection procedures on a wheel loader of a mining company. A team of professional collaborators from the mining company evaluated the simulator under several scenarios. The computational results showed that the simulator provided the employees with an initial experience before conducting an actual field inspection of the wheel loader. In this sense, the simulator increases the safety of employees and does not expose them to risky situations, owing to a deeper knowledge of inspection procedures. Moreover, the simulator has a lower cost compared to an outsourced contract and can decrease machine downtime. Finally, the simulator is effective for training because it provides professional employees with a sense of realism.},

abstract = {Modern wind turbines are monitored by sensors that generate massive amounts of high frequency time series that are ingested on the edge and then transferred to the cloud where they are stored and analyzed. This results in at least four challenges: (1) Limited hardware makes efficient ingestion necessary to keep up; (2) Limited bandwidth makes data compression necessary; (3) High storage costs as all data must be stored; and (4) Low data quality due to lossy compression methods without error bounds. Practitioners currently use solutions that only solve some of these. In this paper, we evaluate the Time Series Management System ModelarDB, a solution that meets all four challenges by efficiently managing time series across the entire pipeline. We compare it to three commonly used alternatives and evaluate different aspects of them in a realistic edge-to-cloud scenario with real-life datasets. For lossless compression, ModelarDB achieves up to 2x better compression and 1.2x better transfer efficiency. For lossy compression, ModelarDB achieves up to 4.6x better compression and 10x better transfer efficiency, or similar compression with orders of magnitude less error.},

abstract = {We study federated unlearning, a novel problem to eliminate the impact of specific clients or data points on the global model learned via federated learning (FL). This problem is driven by the right to be forgotten and the privacy challenges in FL. We introduce a new framework for exact federated unlearning that meets two essential criteria: communication efficiency and exact unlearning provability. To our knowledge, this is the first work to tackle both aspects coherently. We start by giving a rigorous definition of exact federated unlearning, which guarantees that the unlearned model is statistically indistinguishable from the one trained without the deleted data. We then pinpoint the key property that enables fast exact federated unlearning: total variation (TV) stability, which measures the sensitivity of the model parameters to slight changes in the dataset. Leveraging this insight, we develop a TV-stable FL algorithm called FATS, which modifies the classical FedAvg algorithm for TV Stability and employs local SGD with periodic averaging to lower the communication round. We also design efficient unlearning algorithms for FATS under two settings: client-level and sample-level unlearning. We provide theoretical guarantees for our learning and unlearning algorithms, proving that they achieve exact federated unlearning with reasonable convergence rates for both the original and unlearned models. We empirically validate our framework on 6 benchmark datasets, and show its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, communication cost, computation cost, and unlearning efficacy.},

abstract = {On-device adapting to continual, unpredictable domain shifts is essential for mobile applications like autonomous driving and augmented reality to deliver seamless user experiences in evolving environments. Test-time adaptation (TTA) emerges as a promising solution by tuning model parameters with unlabeled live data immediately before prediction. However, TTA's unique forward-backward-reforward pipeline notably increases the latency over standard inference, undermining the responsiveness in time-sensitive mobile applications. This paper presents AdaShadow, a responsive test-time adaptation framework for non-stationary mobile data distribution and resource dynamics via selective updates of adaptation-critical layers. Although the tactic is recognized in generic on-device training, TTA's unsupervised and online context presents unique challenges in estimating layer importance and latency, as well as scheduling the optimal layer update plan. AdaShadow addresses these challenges with a backpropagation-free assessor to rapidly identify critical layers, a unit-based runtime predictor to account for resource dynamics in latency estimation, and an online scheduler for prompt layer update planning. Also, AdaShadow incorporates a memory I/O-aware computation reuse scheme to further reduce latency in the reforwardpass. Results show that AdaShadow achieves the best accuracy-latency balance under continual shifts. At low memory and energy costs, Adashadow provides a 2x to 3.5x speedup (ms-level) over state-of-the-art TTA methods with comparable accuracy and a 14.8% to 25.4% accuracy boost over efficient supervised methods with similar latency.},

abstract = {The single-board computer (SBC) is a compact, powerful and cost-effective system on chip (SOC) that can perform all complex tasks that may be executed by the desktop computer. Further, with the development of the SBCs having a powerful processor and high RAM support–they are already deployed in many applications such as in agriculture, home security, automation, drones, unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) and like-wise. However, each SBC has a unique capability and therefore some SBC may perform better than others depending upon the application. Further, some SBC has high processing power but they are either costly or support fewer I/O pins. Similarly, some SBC are cost-effective, has a high number of I/O pins but they have quite less processing power for executing complex instructions and tasks. In addition, for some SBC there is no dedicated integrated development environment (IDE) available that can be used to program SBC according to the user-specific need. Due to these above-mentioned problems, the user has to either invest in the high processing power SBC (having high price) but compromise with less I/O pins or invest in the SBC (having low price) that has the high number of I/O pins but compromise with low processing power (although there are some SBCs available in the market that has high processing power along with the high number of I/O pins. But they are available at a quite high price so we are not considering these SBCs). In both cases, the user is not able to integrate intelligent high processing sensors and equip the system in which SBC is used with new features over time. To over this problem, we are introducing a smart and highly intelligent hybrid implementation of Raspberry pi model 3b+ with Arduino UNO board for controlling UGV. During testing, we have found that our developed hybrid SBC system for UGV work quite impressively. The CPU utilization and CPU temperature readings of the hybrid system are noted while performing various complex tasks on the UGV. Further during the evaluation process, it is observed that UGV consumed a maximum of 80% of system CPU utilization to perform all the allocated tasks efficiently. The rest 20% of the CPU usage as well as some of the GPIO pins of Raspberry pi are reserved and can be used to implement various complex applications in the UGV based on the user requirement.},

abstract = {Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have achieved remarkable performance for various language understanding tasks in IR systems, which require the fine-tuning process based on labeled training data. For low-resource scenarios, prompt-based learning for PLMs exploits prompts as task guidance and turns downstream tasks into masked language problems for effective few-shot fine-tuning. In most existing approaches, the high performance of prompt-based learning heavily relies on handcrafted prompts and verbalizers, which may limit the application of such approaches in real-world scenarios. To solve this issue, we present CP-Tuning, an end-to-end Contrastive Prompt Tuning framework for fine-tuning PLMs without any manual engineering of task-specific prompts and verbalizers. It is integrated with the task-invariant continuous prompt encoding technique with fully trainable prompt parameters. We further propose the pair-wise cost-sensitive contrastive learning procedure to optimize the model in order to achieve verbalizer-free class mapping and enhance the task-invariance of prompts. It explicitly learns to distinguish different classes and makes the decision boundary smoother by assigning different costs to easy and hard cases. Experiments over a variety of language understanding tasks and different PLMs show that CP-Tuning outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Cycling is an efficient and effective way to improve one's overall fitness level, such as cardiovascular fitness, stamina, lower body strength, and body fat percentage. To improve fitness performance, real-time cycling fitness tracking can not only allow cyclists to better control their energy outputs but also help push workout intensity and keep users accountable for their fitness progress. However, existing bike sensors (e.g., the ones mounted to bike's wheel hub or crank arm) are only limited to measuring cycling cadence and speed. Although several recent studies relying on on-body sensors or cameras can provide more fine-grained information (e.g., riding position and knee joint angle), they would either require inconvenient setups or raise serious privacy concerns. To circumvent these limitations, in this paper, we propose SmarCyPad, an innovative smart seat pad that can continuously and unobtrusively track five cycling-specific metrics, including cadence, per-leg stability, leg strength balance, riding position, and knee joint angle of the cyclist. Specifically, we embed conductive fabric sensors in the seat pad to sense the pressure applied to the bike's seat exerted by the cyclist's gluteal muscles. A series of signal processing algorithms are developed to estimate the pedaling period from the sensed pressure signal and further derive the cycling cadence, per-leg stability, and leg strength balance. Additionally, we leverage a deep learning model to detect the cyclist's riding position and reconstruct the cyclist's knee joint angles via linear regression. The sensors and the system prototype are manufactured from scratch leveraging off-the-shelf materials, and the total cost is less than $50. Extensive experiments involving 15 participants demonstrate that SmarCyPad can accurately estimate the cycling cadence with an average error of 1.13 rounds per minute, quantify the cycling stability for each leg, detect cycling imbalance, distinguish five riding positions with an accuracy of 96.60%, and continuously track the knee joint angle with an average mean error as low as 9.58 degrees.},

abstract = {The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the availability of low-cost cloud services have led to an increase in the sensory and data processing needs of IoT systems. TrustZone is a hardware-based security solution designed for ARM processors in IoT handheld systems. It provides memory isolation to protect trusted application data from potential exploitation by malicious actors. This paper examines the vulnerabilities of the TrustZone extension of ARM Cortex-M processors and develops a threat model to carry out these attacks. After performing multi-variety attacks from different angles, it is found that TrustZone is susceptible to buffer overflow attacks that can compromise the security of other trusted apps. The vulnerabilities in TrustZone are attributed to the absence of validation for input parameters in the entry function and the failure to perform boundary-checking of memory allocation. The vulnerability known as Achilles’ Heel can be found in any aspect of the TrustZone security system, making it susceptible to MOFlow attacks because the framework does not have adequate automatic safeguards in place. The proposed attacks were successfully tested on two recent ARM Cortex-M23 and M33 processors. Finally, a trust model is proposed to address these vulnerabilities.},

abstract = {The ability to recognize and detect changes in human posture is important in a wide range of applications such as health care and human–computer interaction. Achieving this goal using loose-fit garments instrumented with sensors is particularly challenging, due to the complex interaction between garments and human body. Herein we present a method to detect and recognize human posture with casual loose-fitting smart garments integrated with highly sensitive, stretchable, optical transparent, and low-cost strain sensors. By attaching these sensors to an off-the-shelf casual jacket, we developed a smart loose-fitting sensing garment that enables posture recognition using a deep learning model, domain-adaptive Convolutional Neural Networks–Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM). This deep learning model overcame the noise and variation due to the complex interaction between loose-fitting garments and human body. Considering that users’ labeled data are usually not available in the training stage, an additional domain discriminator path on the conventional CNN-LSTM model has been introduced to further improve the adaptability. To evaluate the potential of this loose-fitting smart garment, three case studies were conducted under realistic conditions: recognitions of human activities, stationary postures with random hand movements and slouch. Our results demonstrate the potential of the proposed smart garment system for practical applications.},

abstract = {Measuring the built and natural environment at a fine-grained scale is now possible with low-cost urban environmental sensor networks. However, fine-grained city-scale data analysis is complicated by tedious data cleaning including removing outliers and imputing missing data. While many methods exist to automatically correct anomalies and impute missing entries, challenges still exist on data with large spatial-temporal scales and shifting patterns. To address these challenges, we propose an online robust tensor recovery (OLRTR) method to preprocess streaming high-dimensional urban environmental datasets. A small-sized dictionary that captures the underlying patterns of the data is computed and constantly updated with new data. OLRTR enables online recovery for large-scale sensor networks that provide continuous data streams, with a lower computational memory usage compared to offline batch counterparts. In addition, we formulate the objective function so that OLRTR can detect structured outliers, such as faulty readings over a long period of time. We validate OLRTR on a synthetically degraded National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration temperature dataset, and apply it to the Array of Things city-scale sensor network in Chicago, IL, showing superior results compared with several established online and batch-based low-rank decomposition methods.},

Moreover, they can transmit data produced by embedded sensors and carry packages of different size and weight. Based on these characteristics, the approach of building custom UAVs, for different applications is very common. Since each application requires specific hardware for the UAVs’ efficient operation, the selection of the appropriate parts is not an easy task.

abstract = {Customer-product interaction (pickup or put down) detection is essential for autonomous retail. Previous studies have explored many sensing technologies, including vision, load, RFID, and piezo. These approaches often require strict deployment conditions, such as Line-of-Sight (LoS), dense deployment, and/or high cost.In this paper, we present a vibration-based customer-product interaction detection system for autonomous retail. We propose to use one vibration sensor placed on the back panel of the gondola to achieve single-point sensing to monitor all the shelves on the gondola. The key challenge is to detect pickup of small items (e.g., candy bar), which induces extremely low SNR vibration signals. We introduce CPA, a cyber-physical augmentation scheme to enhance the vibration sensing signal via a physical arc structure and achieves high accuracy labeling-free event detection. We evaluate CPA in a real-world scenario by deploying a vibration sensor on a retail gondola to monitor interactions across multiple shelves. Our approach demonstrates up to 2.9X improvement for light-weight product pickup event detection.},

abstract = {The metadata service (MDS) sits on the critical path for distributed file system (DFS) operations, and therefore it is key to the overall performance of a large-scale DFS. Common "serverful" MDS architectures, such as a single server or cluster of servers, have a significant shortcoming: either they are not scalable, or they make it difficult to achieve an optimal balance of performance, resource utilization, and cost. A modern MDS requires a novel architecture that addresses this shortcoming.To this end, we design and implement γFS, an elastic, high-performance metadata service for large-scale DFSes. γFS scales a DFS metadata cache elastically on a FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) platform and synthesizes a series of techniques to overcome the obstacles that are encountered when building large, stateful, and performance-sensitive applications on FaaS platforms. γFS takes full advantage of the unique benefits offered by FaaS---elastic scaling and massive parallelism---to realize a highly-optimized metadata service capable of sustaining up to 4.13X higher throughput, 90.40% lower latency, 85.99% lower cost, 3.33X better performance-per-cost, and better resource utilization and efficiency than a state-of-the-art DFS for an industrial workload.},

abstract = {The geographically distributed edge servers can naturally draw power from nearby renewable energy&nbsp;(RE) generators. Complemented by the dynamic scheduling of energy storage batteries, edge service providers&nbsp;(ESPs) can thus build low- or even zero-carbon edge computing systems. Nevertheless, the distributed and heterogeneous nature of edge computing systems, as well as the limited information sharing among ESPs, leads to a more complex battery planning problem than that in cloud computing. The unpredictability of RE resources further complicates the problem, making conventional model-based approaches ineffective. To this end, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach for the independent decision making of individual ESPs. Particularly, MADRL takes privacy into account by ensuring that no sensitive information is disclosed among ESPs. For better model training, we further customize the invalid action masking and develop action transformation techniques based on segmented linear optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, with our proposed approach, the overall carbon emission of edge computing systems can be significantly reduced (by over 60%) while maintaining acceptable operation costs in battery scheduling.},

abstract = {Geo-information extraction from satellite imagery has become crucial to carry out large-scale ground surveys in a short amount of time. With the increasing number of commercial satellites launched into orbit in recent years, high-resolution RGB color remote sensing imagery has attracted a lot of attention. However, because of the high cost of image acquisition and even more complicated annotation procedures, there are limited high-resolution satellite datasets available. Compared to close-range imagery datasets, existing satellite datasets have a much lower number of images and cover only a few scenarios (cities, background environments, etc.). They may not be sufficient for training robust learning models that fit all environmental conditions or be representative enough for training regional models that optimize for local scenarios. Instead of collecting and annotating more data, using synthetic images could be another solution to boost the performance of a model. This article proposes a GAN-assisted training scheme for road segmentation from high-resolution RGB color satellite images, which includes three critical components: (a) synthetic training sample generation, (b) synthetic training sample selection, and (c) assisted training strategy. Apart from the GeoPalette and cSinGAN image generators introduced in our prior work, this article explains in detail how to generate new training pairs using OpenStreetMap (OSM) and introduces a new set of evaluation metrics for selecting synthetic training pairs from a pool of generated samples. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments to compare different image generators and training strategies. Our experiments on the downstream road segmentation task show that (1) our proposed metrics are more aligned with the trained model performance compared to commonly used GAN evaluation metrics such as the Fr\'{e}chet inception distance (FID); and (2) by using synthetic data with the best training strategy, the model performance, mean Intersection over Union (mean IoU), is improved from 60.92% to 64.44%, when 1,000 real training pairs are available for learning, which reaches a similar level of performance as a model that is standard-trained with 4,000 real images (64.59%), i.e., enabling a 4-fold reduction in real dataset size.},

But air conditioning also has the disadvantages of higher price, large volume and inconvenient to carry, while the fan is a low-cost, convenient to carry cooling equipment. However, traditional fans not only have few functions, but also need to be manually controlled and adjusted, resulting in low intelligence. Therefore, in view of the disadvantages of traditional fans, such as manually switching machine, adjusting wind speed and single function, this paper introduces an intelligent temperature controlled human body induction fan. The induction fan uses temperature sensor DS18B20 to detect the temperature change, selects the audion as the driving part, and then controls by STC89C52 MCU. External buttons are set to set the upper and lower limits of temperature, and the pyroelectric sensor is used to realize the human body induction function. Display detection temperature and tap on LCD1602 LCD screen. The fan detects the presence of the human body according to the sensor and determines whether to turn on or off intelligently. If the detected temperature reaches the set value, the induction fan will automatically switch the corresponding gear to change the wind speed.Finally, the feasibility and practicability of the design are verified by the test. Compared with traditional fans, this design saves time and energy, and is more convenient to use in daily life.},

Due to advanced low-cost and easily available tools and software, manipulation of these images is an easy task. Thus, the security of digital images is a serious challenge for the content owners, healthcare communities, and researchers against illegal access and fraudulent usage. In this article, a secure medical image encryption algorithm, EiMOL, based on optimization and the Lorenz system, is proposed for smart healthcare applications. In the first stage, an optimized random sequence (ORS) is generated through directed weighted complex network particle swarm optimization using the genetic algorithm (GDWCN-PSO). This random number matrix and the Lorenz system are adopted to encrypt plain medical images, obtaining the cipher messages with a relationship to the plain images. According to our obtained results, the proposed EiMOL encryption algorithm is effective and resistant to the many attacks on benchmark Kaggle and Open-i datasets. Further, extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {In-sensor computing has emerged as a promising approach to mitigating huge data transmission costs between sensors and processing units. Recently, the emerging application scenarios have raised more demands of sensory technology for large-area and flexible integration. However, with thin-film technologies that are capable of providing flexible and large-area integration support, the implementation of in-sensor computing can be strongly restricted due to the low device performance, large-area integration variation, and costly interface between sensors and CMOS processors. To address this challenge, we propose an in-sensor computing architecture to facilitate high-parallelism NN pre-processing and effective data compression. The boundaries of computing parallelism are expanded by adopting compact ROM-based compute-in-memory scheme next to sensing array. Differential-frame computing provides not only excellent robustness, but also high data sparsity. A bio-inspired data compression method with residual recovery caches and zero-skip circuits further enhances output sparsity without accumulated error. Based on the proposed cross-layer design optimization, an LTPS TFT-based ROM CiM chip has been fabricated and experimentally measured. The system-level evaluation demonstrates 3.85\texttimes{} speedup and 5.10\texttimes{} energy efficiency improvement compared with traditional architecture with separated sensors and processors, outperforming existing in-sensor computing works in large-area thin-film technology scenarios.},

abstract = {The Bluetooth 5.1 specification introduces the Angle of Arrival feature, which significantly enhances its applications in indoor positioning. Given the height of the target, a single BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) base station can locate the target, thereby reducing deployment costs. However, existing methods often assume that the target's height is known in advance and remains constant, which is not always true in practice. The height can vary significantly due to user posture changes, such as when picking up a phone from a pocket, leading to positioning errors. In this paper, we propose BleHe, a novel indoor positioning system that incorporates height correction to enhance positioning accuracy in scenarios with dynamic height changes. BleHe detects height changes by utilizing on-device IMU sensor and subsequently notifies the base station of any detected height change events. To avoid altering the commodity Bluetooth protocols, rather than directly modifying application data, we create a side channel to delivery the height change information from the device to the base station by adjusting the BLE packet transmission frequency. This method allows the base station to infer the start and end times of height changes and subsequently refine the target's trajectory using a height-aware particle filtering-based positioning correction method that we propose. Experimental results demonstrate that BleHe achieves an average positioning error of 34.4cm, even in scenarios involving posture changes during walking.},

abstract = {Room acoustic synthesis can be used in virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and gaming applications to enhance listeners' sense of immersion, realism and externalisation. A common approach is to use geometrical acoustics (GA) models to compute impulse responses at interactive speed, and fast convolution methods to apply said responses in real time. Alternatively, delay-network-based models are capable of modeling certain aspects of room acoustics, but with a significantly lower computational cost. In order to bridge the gap between these classes of models, recent work introduced delay network designs that approximate Acoustic Radiance Transfer (ART), a geometrical acoustics (GA) model that simulates the transfer of acoustic energy between discrete surface patches in an environment. This paper presents two key extensions of such designs. The first extension involves a new physically-based and stability-preserving design of the feedback matrices, enabling more accurate control of scattering and, more in general, of late reverberation properties. The second extension allows an arbitrary number of early reflections to be modeled with high accuracy, meaning the network can be scaled at will between computational cost and early reverberation precision. The proposed extensions are compared to the baseline ART-approximating delay network as well as two reference GA models. The evaluation is based on objective measures of perceptually-relevant features, including frequency-dependent reverberation times, echo density build-up, and early decay time. Results show how the proposed extensions result in a significant improvement over the baseline model, especially for the case of non-convex geometries or the case of unevenly distributed wall absorption, both scenarios of broad practical interest.},

The platform also consists of a forest fire detection model based on particulate matter (PM2.5) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) concentration. In our trial, the early warning messages were timely sent to navigate the local forest fire authorities via short messaging applications (i.e., Telegram and Line). The notification messages were analyzed together with real forest fire incidents that occurred in the northern part of Thailand during the fire burning season. The results showed that there were 367 fire events detected in April 2022 that achieved an accuracy of 84%. Our study also discovered the effect of humidity which reduced the accuracy of our model by approximately 13%.},

abstract = {Enterprise environment often screens large-scale (millions of lines of code) codebases with static analysis tools to find bugs and vulnerabilities. Parfait is a static code analysis tool used in Oracle to find security vulnerabilities in industrial codebases. Recently, many studies show that there are complicated cryptographic vulnerabilities caused by misusing cryptographic APIs in JavaTM1 In this paper, we describe how we realize a precise and scalable detection of these complicated cryptographic vulnerabilities based on Parfait framework. The key challenge in the detection of cryptographic vulnerabilities is the high false alarm rate caused by pseudo-influences. Pseudo-influences happen if security-irrelevant constants are used in constructing security-critical values. Static analysis is usually unable to distinguish them from hard-coded constants that expose sensitive information. We tackle this problem by specializing the backward dataflow analysis used in Parfait with refinement insights, an idea from the tool CryptoGuard&nbsp;[20]. We evaluate our analyzer on a comprehensive Java cryptographic vulnerability benchmark and eleven large real-world applications. The results show that the Parfait-based cryptographic vulnerability detector can find real-world cryptographic vulnerabilities in large-scale codebases with high true-positive rates and low runtime cost.},

abstract = {Microwave radars bring many benefits to mid-air gesture sensing due to their large field of view and independence from environmental conditions, such as ambient light and occlusion. However, radar signals are highly dimensional and usually require complex deep learning approaches. To understand this landscape, we report results from a systematic literature review of (N=118) scientific papers on radar sensing, unveiling a large variety of radar technology of different operating frequencies and bandwidths and antenna configurations but also various gesture recognition techniques. Although highly accurate, these techniques require a large amount of training data that depend on the type of radar. Therefore, the training results cannot be easily transferred to other radars. To address this aspect, we introduce a new gesture recognition pipeline that implements advanced full-wave electromagnetic modeling and inversion to retrieve physical characteristics of gestures that are radar independent, i.e., independent of the source, antennas, and radar-hand interactions. Inversion of radar signals further reduces the size of the dataset by several orders of magnitude, while preserving the essential information. This approach is compatible with conventional gesture recognizers, such as those based on template matching, which only need a few training examples to deliver high recognition accuracy rates. To evaluate our gesture recognition pipeline, we conducted user-dependent and user-independent evaluations on a dataset of 16 gesture types collected with the Walabot, a low-cost off-the-shelf array radar. We contrast these results with those obtained for the same gesture types collected with an ultra-wideband radar made of a vector network analyzer with a single horn antenna and with a computer vision sensor, respectively. Based on our findings, we suggest some design implications to support future development in radar-based gesture recognition.},

abstract = {In network-wide monitoring, finding the large monitoring data entries is a fundamental network management function. However, the retrieval of large entries is extremely difficult and challenging as a result of incompleteness of network measurement data. Enlightened by tensor model’s strong capability of information representation and extraction, we model the network-wide monitoring data as a 3-way tensor. With tensor completion, the retrieval can be performed after recovering all missing entries. However, this not only incurs an extremely high cost when the tensor is large, but is also unnecessary. Instead, to quickly retrieve large entries at low cost, we transform the large entry retrieving problem to a cosine similarity searching problem, and propose two algorithms: 1) Quickly reordering the factor vectors based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) hash table so that vectors with small cosine distances are placed in the same hash bucket; 2) Quickly finding the similar vector of a queried one that the two together determine a large entry without incurring the high cost of recovering all entries through the dot products. In the process of LSH table building and similarity query, several novel techniques are proposed, including LSH table representation with the LSH forest, good hash table building to support the flexible search of cosine similarity, and bit-shifting-based quick similarity query. Our experimental studies on 4 real world datasets indicate that our technique is at least up to 60 times faster than the approach based on direct tensor completion.},

This paper proposes three efficient data quality validation and imputation algorithms that identify and replace noisy and missing values with better-quality data. We extensively stress-tested and evaluated our algorithms by deploying them on microcontrollers and small CPU-based IoT boards with memory limited to as little as 32KB. We simulated a sensor data stream using five real-world datasets, including data collected from the Newcastle Urban Observatory. In this setup, each algorithm excelled in different areas, consistently demonstrating high performance across 100 samples in terms of high energy efficiency (0.014 J), low computation time (85.94 ms), and low error rates (0.0019 MAE, 0.0027 RMSE). Remarkably, we found that on average, our algorithms running on hardware, costing less than $10, showed performance on par with state-of-the-art methods on high-end devices. The results also demonstrated that our algorithms enabled on-device cleansing of live streaming sensor data, eliminating the dependency on cloud services and allowing for real-time data quality validation and processing at the edge.},

abstract = {Depth estimation is one of the most challenging tasks in computer vision, especially in self-supervised learning ways without restrictions of high-cost labels. Self-supervised depth estimation aims to infer three-dimensional space structures from two-dimensional planar images, only taking image pairs or sequences as supervision. Most existing methods adopt the encoder-decoder framework with skip-connection and recover the high-resolution depth maps from high-resolution low-level and low-resolution high-level feature maps. However, it is proved that high-resolution high-level feature maps, which are sensitive to illumination, color, texture, etc., are necessary for depth estimation. In this paper, we present a novel approach to extract high-level feature maps at all scales and introduce a self-attention mechanism to consider non-local features. The main improvements of our proposed method are two-fold:1) we combined the high-resolution feature extraction sub-network and extract high-resolution high-level features by connecting the high-to-low resolution convolution streams in parallel; 2) we embed the self-attention module with the features pyramid module(FPA) to obtain general context at large-scale features. The experiments evaluated on the KITTI benchmark have demonstrated that our network outperforms most existing methods and produces more accurate depth maps.},

abstract = {Matrix Algebra and Deep Neural Networks represent foundational classes of computational algorithms across multiple emerging applications like Augmented Reality or Virtual Reality, autonomous navigation (cars, drones, robots), data science, and various artificial intelligence-driven solutions. An accelerator-based architecture can provide performance and energy efficiency supporting fixed functions through customized data paths. However, constrained Edge systems requiring multiple applications and diverse matrix operations to be efficiently supported, cannot afford numerous custom accelerators. In this article, we present MxCore, a unified architecture that comprises tightly coupled vector and programmable cores sharing data through highly optimized interconnects along with a configurable hardware scheduler managing the co-execution. We submit MxCore as the generalized approach to facilitate the flexible acceleration of multiple Matrix Algebra and Deep-learning applications across a range of sparsity levels. Unified compute resources improve overall resource utilization and performance per unit area. Aggressive and novel microarchitecture techniques along with block-level sparsity support optimize compute and data-reuse to minimize bandwidth and power requirements enabling ultra-low latency applications for low-power and cost-sensitive Edge deployments. MxCore requires a small silicon footprint of 0.2068 mm2, in a modern 7-nm process at 1 GHz and achieves (0.15 FP32 and 0.62 INT8) TMAC/mm2, dissipating only 11.66 μW of leakage power. At iso-technology and iso-frequency, MxCore provides an energy efficiency of 651.4\texttimes{}, 159.9\texttimes{}, 104.8\texttimes{}, and 124.2\texttimes{} as compared to the 128-core Nvidia’s Maxwell GPU for dense General Matrix Multiply, sparse Deep Neural Network, Cholesky decomposition, and triangular matrix solve respectively.},

abstract = {Task-oriented object detection is increasingly essential for intelligent sensing applications, enabling AI systems to operate autonomously in complex, real-world environments such as autonomous driving, healthcare, and industrial automation. Conventional models often struggle with generalization, requiring vast datasets to accurately detect objects within diverse contexts. In this work, we introduce iTask, a task-oriented object detection framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generalize efficiently from limited samples by generating an abstract knowledge graph. This graph encapsulates essential task attributes, allowing iTask to identify objects based on high-level characteristics rather than extensive data, making it possible to adapt to complex mission requirements with minimal samples.iTask addresses the challenges of high computational cost and resource limitations in vision-language models by offering two configuration models: a distilled, task-specific vision transformer optimized for high accuracy in defined tasks, and a quantized version of the model for broader applicability across multiple tasks. Additionally, we designed a hardware acceleration circuit to support real-time processing, essential for edge devices that require low latency and efficient task execution. Our evaluations show that the task-specific configuration achieves a 15% higher accuracy over the quantized configuration in specific scenarios, while the quantized model provides robust multi-task performance. The hardware-accelerated iTask system achieves a 3.5x speedup and a 40% reduction in energy consumption compared to GPU-based implementations. These results demonstrate that iTask 's dual-configuration approach and situational adaptability offer a scalable solution for task-specific object detection, providing robust and efficient performance in resource-constrained environments.},

Different interaction technologies, techniques, and methods can support it, including RFID, a well-known technology capable of identifying and locating actors. However, the variety of application domains and interaction possibilities jeopardize the use of RFID without a clear understanding of its usage issues. Therefore, we have performed a systematic mapping to characterize the adoption of RFID technology in this kind of interactive software system by intercepting human-computer interaction and software engineering issues. Our goal is to reveal (i) which application domains address RFID; (ii) why RFID is used instead of other technologies; (iii) who interacts through RFID and how the interaction is; (iv) what are the requirements and limitations associated with it; and (v) what are the common quality characteristics and measures which should be considered for their evaluation. The results showed that (i) RFID is specially used for implementing implicit interactions in healthcare, embedded systems, and manufacturing applications. (ii) Passive UHF RFID is usually adopted due to being contactless, low-cost, and well-performing indoors. (iii) It interacts with humans and things in the same proportion, most frequently to collect locations of sensor data constantly. (iv) RFID presents limitations, such as causing electromagnetic interference and not working well near metallic walls. However, tags work under high temperatures and can be well hidden in cement or clothes. (v) Interactive system designers usually create applications with invisible infrastructures, which tend to keep users' focus on the real world.?},

However, existing solutions for driver drowsiness detection have major drawbacks of requiring special hardware, constrained recording conditions, and cannot handle the asynchronous and contradictory nature of multiple indicators. In view of this, we propose FDWatch, a novel drowsiness detection system that exploits the low-cost Photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor and motion sensor integrated into wrist-worn devices. We design a set of novel algorithms to extract multiple drowsiness-related indicators covering major categories of human factors. In particular, we demonstrate that commodity PPG sensors can be utilized to detect yawning behavior; it contributes as an important indicator for drowsiness detection. The core of FDWatch is based on the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. It considers different indicators as evidence describing the state of the driver from different angles. To make the extracted indicators applicable to Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, we employ backpropagation neural networks to obtain the basic probability assignment. Moreover, we propose a similarity-distance-based method to handle evidence conflicts. Extensive experiments with real-road driving data show that FDWatch can accurately detect driver drowsiness with a missing alarm rate of 3.57% and a false alarm rate of 3.68%.},

For this reason, more complex electronic tagging technologies exist, which can sense and change state, but either require special equipment to read or are orders of magnitude more expensive than printed markers. In this work, we explore an approach between these two extremes: one that retains the simple, low-cost nature of printed markers, yet has some of the expressive capabilities of dynamic tags. Our “DynaTags” are simple mechanisms constructed from paper that express multiple payloads, allowing practitioners and researchers to create new and compelling physical-digital experiences. We describe a library of 23 mechanisms that can be read by standard smartphone reader apps. Through a series of demo applications (augmenting reality through e.g., sounds, environmental lighting and graphics) we show how our tags can bring new interactivity to previously static experiences.},

abstract = {Perception systems enable autonomous systems to interpret raw sensor readings of the physical world. Testing of perception systems aims to reveal misinterpretations that could cause system failures. Current testing methods, however, are inadequate. The cost of human interpretation and annotation of real-world input data is high, so manual test suites tend to be small. The simulation-reality gap reduces the validity of test results based on simulated worlds. And methods for synthesizing test inputs do not provide corresponding expected interpretations. To address these limitations, we developed semSensFuzz, a new approach to fuzz testing of perception systems based on semantic mutation of test cases that pair real-world sensor readings with their ground-truth interpretations. We implemented our approach to assess its feasibility and potential to improve software testing for perception systems. We used it to generate 150,000 semantically mutated image inputs for five state-of-the-art perception systems. We found that it synthesized tests with novel and subjectively realistic image inputs, and that it discovered inputs that revealed significant inconsistencies between the specified and computed interpretations. We also found that it produced such test cases at a cost that was very low compared to that of manual semantic annotation of real-world images.},

abstract = {Nonintrusive load regulation capacity monitoring is an effective way to obtain load data and achieve load sensing and demand response at low cost, with the identification method for load regulation capacity as its important core technology. A new identification method for nonintrusive load regulation capacity integrating PCA-DBSCAN clustering and comprehensive correlation analysis and a subsidy demand calculation method are studied in this paper. Firstly, to address the problem of high dimensionality of the original load features, the PCA algorithm is used to reduce the dimensionality of the original feature data and construct a load feature template library; meanwhile, the load current waveform is obtained and a load current template library is constructed. Secondly, the DBSCAN clustering algorithm is used for unsupervised clustering of the samples in the load feature template library and to extract the centers of each cluster. Thirdly, the Euclidean distance between the load to be identified and each cluster center of the feature template is calculated to complete the load feature matching, and the comprehensive correlation between the load current waveform to be identified and each current waveform in the current template library is calculated to complete the load current waveform matching. Fourthly, the two matching results are integrated to comprehensively judge the load to be identified. Further, the composite load regulation capacity is calculated based on the regulation capacity of each type of component load and its proportion. Finally, the subsidy demand of composite load regulation is calculated according to the subsidy amount of demand response in typical regions in recent years, so as to achieve highly reliable identification. The results of the simulation experiments on the test data set of electricity consumption data show that the proposed method achieves more than 96% of each index, which is a great improvement in accuracy compared with that of other references, and is conducive to improving the demand response policy and upgrading the new load management level.},

abstract = {Phased array beamforming has been extensively explored as a physical layer primitive to improve the secrecy capacity of wireless communication links. However, existing solutions are incompatible with low-profile IoT devices due to cost, power and form factor constraints. More importantly, they are vulnerable to eavesdroppers with a high-sensitivity receiver. This paper presents Protego, which offloads the security protection to a metasurface comprised of a large number of 1-bit programmable unit-cells (i.e., phase shifters). Protego builds on a novel observation that, due to phase quantization effect, not all the unit-cells contribute equally to beamforming. By judiciously flipping the phase shift of certain unit-cells, Protego can generate artificial phase noise to obfuscate the signals towards potential eavesdroppers, while preserving the signal integrity and beamforming gain towards the legitimate receiver. A hardware prototype along with extensive experiments has validated the feasibility and effectiveness of Protego.},

abstract = {With the fast evolution of large language models (LLMs), privacy concerns with user queries arise as they may contain sensitive information. Private inference based on homomorphic encryption (HE) has been proposed to protect user query privacy. However, private embedding table query has to be formulated as a HE-based matrix-vector multiplication problem and suffers from enormous computation and communication overhead. We observe the overhead mainly comes from the neglect of 1) the one-hot nature of user queries and 2) the robustness of the embedding table to low bit-width quantization noise. Hence, in this paper, we propose a private embedding table query optimization framework, dubbed FastQuery. FastQuery features a communication-aware embedding table quantization algorithm and a one-hot-aware dense packing algorithm to simultaneously reduce both the computation and communication costs. Compared to prior-art HE-based frameworks, e.g., Cheetah, Iron, and Bumblebee, FastQuery achieves more than 4.3\texttimes{}, 2.7\texttimes{}, 1.3\texttimes{} latency reduction, respectively and more than 75.7\texttimes{}, 60.2\texttimes{}, 20.2\texttimes{} communication reduction, respectively, on both LLAMA-7B and LLAMA-30B.},

abstract = {Computer architects continue to explore newer ways to provide the abstraction of a large but fast memory to the processor. This work proposes a memory system that achieves this abstraction using a hybrid cache – a combination of an SRAM array and a Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM (STTRAM) array, at the highest level (L1) of the memory hierarchy. We overcome the issue of longer access latency of STTRAM arrays by placing those cache lines which are likely to be accessed by a critical load instruction (or delay-sensitive loads) into the SRAM array. Our characterization of the CPU SPEC2017 benchmarks shows that most load instructions are tolerant to access latency of STTRAM array, which makes a small (but fast) SRAM array amenable. The higher densities and lower leakage power of the STTRAM array also make it amenable to provision for larger capacity without significant area overhead. Through extensive simulations of SPEC2017 benchmarks, we show that a combination of a small but fast SRAM array, and a large STTRAM array yields an average performance gain of up to 6.1 % when compared to a baseline system that uses only an SRAM-array-based cache of similar area. This performance improvement comes at a cost of a 1.7 % increase in the energy consumption of the private caches.},

While humans are able to fluidly iterate on collecting and organizing information in their minds, existing tools and approaches introduce significant friction into the process. We introduce Fuse, a browser extension that externalizes users’ working memory by combining low-cost collection with lightweight organization of content in a compact card-based sidebar that is always available. Fuse helps users simultaneously extract key web content and structure it in a lightweight and visual way. We discuss how these affordances help users externalize more of their mental model into the system (e.g., saving, annotating, and structuring items) and support fast reviewing and resumption of task contexts. Our 22-month public deployment and follow-up interviews provide longitudinal insights into the structuring behaviors of real-world users conducting information foraging tasks.},

This study quantifies the trade-off equilibrium between timber harvest income and carbon credit revenue through integrated application of net present value (NPV) analysis and forest carbon sink accounting frameworks. Focusing on a representative afforestation project in Inner Mongolia, the model incorporates key variables including timber yield, carbon sequestration rates, and market discount rates. Analytical results reveal a break-even carbon price of 69 CNY/ton below the current CCER trading average–demonstrating carbon credit sales' economic viability as a forest management strategy. Sensitivity analysis further indicates that extending rotation periods could enhance carbon pricing competitiveness. These findings substantiate that optimized carbon-inclusive forestry models could generate higher compound returns compared to conventional timber-focused operations, simultaneously advancing China's dual carbon goals and ecological civilization construction. Policy recommendations emphasize refining carbon pricing mechanisms and developing species-specific sequestration coefficients to incentivize low-carbon silviculture practices.},

abstract = {This study examines the potential of hybrid solar wind systems as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuel generators for women entrepreneurs in northern Nigeria, a region where more than 85 million people lack reliable electricity access. Using a mixed methods approach, the research investigates energy usage patterns, renewable energy awareness levels, and the feasibility of adopting solar-wind hybrid systems among women-led micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Findings reveal that while the national grid remains the primary energy source, 2.2% of 2,537 participants surveyed use wind energy, and 19.3% adopt some form of solar energy. The survey evaluated monthly energy consumption patterns from lower- and middle-income earners, revealing that a smaller percentage (15.6%) spent between N25,000 (USD 16.30) and N50,000 (USD 32.60), while 27.1% spent between N15,000 (USD 9.78) and N25,000 (USD 16.30) on energy every month. This implies that a significant portion of the income generated by women-owned businesses in Northern Nigeria is spent on energy costs rather than being used for business investment readiness activities. The paper highlights the necessity of specific environmental policies, such as local production and circular economy initiatives for solar and wind hybrid materials and pay-as-you-go financing models. The inclusion of vulnerable community groups for gender-sensitive business thinking models will contribute to Nigeria’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), fostering inclusive economic growth. Solar-wind hybrid systems can become a significant alternative to reduce energy poverty and empower women-led businesses by utilising Northern Nigeria’s abundant solar radiation and wind speed.},

abstract = {Many studies have focused on the impact of Media Access Control (MAC) layer protocols on wireless sensor networks (WSN). In realistic Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios, multiple protocols are used to ensure the efficient operation of the network. IP Header Compression (IPHC) is a well-known packet compression protocol in the IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN). Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) is specified as the latest generation of MAC layer protocol in the IEEE 802.15.4e standard. Since the emergence of battery-powered WSN, low cost and low power consumption have become important development directions. This article studies the performance of TSCH on IPHC in terms of energy consumption and compares with Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA). Different metrics were chosen, such as latency, duty cycle, packet delivery rate, and energy consumption. The experiment uses the Contiki-NG operating system to implement network transmission scenarios. The results show that the combination of IPHC and TSCH protocols greatly improves the capability of WSN, and has better performance in terms of energy consumption and duty cycle. Although TSCH exhibits a higher latency than CSMA, it obtains a better packet delivery rate.},

Current solutions are not only time-consuming and error-prone, requiring significant user input, but also fail to provide appropriate recommendations. We present Doppler, a scalable recommendation engine that provides right-sized Azure SQL Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) recommendations without requiring access to sensitive customer data and queries. Doppler introduces a novel price-performance methodology that allows customers to get a personalized rank of relevant cloud targets solely based on low-level resource statistics, such as latency and memory usage. Doppler supplements this rank with internal knowledge of Azure customer behavior to help guide new migration customers towards one optimal target. Experimental results over a 9-month period from prospective and existing customers indicate that Doppler can identify optimal targets and adapt to changes in customer workloads. It has also found cost-saving opportunities among over-provisioned cloud customers, without compromising on capacity or other requirements. Doppler has been integrated and released in the Azure Data Migration Assistant v5.5, which receives hundreds of assessment requests daily.},

abstract = {Several papers have been published over the last ten years to provide a defense against intentional spoofing to sensors. However, these defenses would only work against those spoofing signals, which have a separate frequency from the original signal being measured. These defenses would not work if the spoofing attack signal (i) has a frequency equal to the frequency of original signals, (ii) has zero frequency, and (iii) is strong enough to drive the sensor output close to its saturation region. More specifically, these defenses are not designed for a magnetic spoofing attack on passive Hall sensors. Our work begins to fill this gap by providing a defense against the magnetic spoofing attack on passive Hall sensors. Our proposed defense HALC can detect and contain all types of strong and weak magnetic spoofing, such as constant, sinusoidal, and pulsating magnetic fields, in real-time. HALC works up to ∼ 9000 G of external magnetic spoofing within a frequency range of 0 - 150 kHz, whereas existing defenses work only when the spoofing signals have a separate frequency from the original signal being measured. HALC utilizes the analog and digital cores to achieve a constant computational complexity O(1). Moreover, it is low-power (∼ 1.9 mW), low-cost (∼ $12), and can be implemented in the sensor hardware. We have tested HALC on ten different industry-used Hall sensors from four different manufacturers to prove its efficacy and found that the correlation coefficient between the signals before and after the attack is greater than 0.91 in every test case. Moreover, we demonstrate its efficacy in two practical systems: a grid-tied solar inverter and a rotation-per-minute measurement system. We find through experiments that HALC is a robust real-time defense against a magnetic spoofing attack on passive Hall sensors.},

Hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs) provide promising and practical platforms for low-cost privacy-preserving data processing. However, using TEEs to enhance the security of data analytics frameworks like Apache Spark involves challenging issues when separating various framework components into trusted and untrusted domains, demanding meticulous considerations for programmability, performance, and security.Based on Intel SGX, we build Flare, a fast, secure, and memory-efficient data analytics framework with a familiar user programming interface and useful functionalities similar to Apache Spark. Flare ensures confidentiality and integrity by keeping sensitive data and computations encrypted and authenticated. It also supports oblivious processing to protect against access pattern side channels. The main innovations of Flare include a novel abstraction paradigm of shadow operators and shadow tasks to minimize trusted components and reduce domain switch overheads, memory-efficient data processing with proper granularities for different operators, and adaptive parallelization based on memory allocation intensity for better scalability. Flare outperforms the state-of-the-art secure framework by 3.0\texttimes{} to 176.1\texttimes{}, and is also 2.8\texttimes{} to 28.3\texttimes{} faster than a monolithic libOS-based integration approach.},

abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically impacted life around the globe. As life returns to pre-pandemic routines, COVID-19 testing has become a key component, assuring that travellers and citizens are free from the disease. Conventional tests can be expensive, time-consuming (results can take up to 48 h), and require laboratory testing. Rapid antigen testing, in turn, can generate results within 15-30 minutes and can be done at home, but research shows they achieve very poor sensitivity rates. In this paper, we propose an alternative based on speech signals recorded at home with a portable device. It has been well-documented that the virus affects many of the speech production systems (e.g., lungs, larynx, and articulators). As such, we propose the use of new modulation spectral features and linear prediction analysis to characterize these changes via a two-stage classification system. Experiments on three COVID-19 speech datasets show that the proposed two-stage system outperforms several state-of-the-art benchmarks, relies on interpretable features, as well as generalizes well to unseen datasets. Overall, the proposed system shows promise as an accessible, low-cost, at-home method for COVID-19 detection.},

abstract = {Existing scene text spotting (i.e., end-to-end text detection and recognition) methods rely on costly bounding box annotations (e.g., text-line, word-level, or character-level bounding boxes). For the first time, we demonstrate that training scene text spotting models can be achieved with an extremely low-cost annotation of a single-point for each instance. We propose an end-to-end scene text spotting method that tackles scene text spotting as a sequence prediction task. Given an image as input, we formulate the desired detection and recognition results as a sequence of discrete tokens and use an auto-regressive Transformer to predict the sequence. The proposed method is simple yet effective, which can achieve state-of-the-art results on widely used benchmarks. Most significantly, we show that the performance is not very sensitive to the positions of the point annotation, meaning that it can be much easier to be annotated or even be automatically generated than the bounding box that requires precise positions. We believe that such a pioneer attempt indicates a significant opportunity for scene text spotting applications of a much larger scale than previously possible.

abstract = {Predictive autoscaling is a key enabler for optimizing cloud resource allocation in Alibaba Cloud's computing platforms, which dynamically adjust the Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instances based on predicted user demands to ensure Quality of Service (QoS). However, user demands in the cloud are often highly complex, with high uncertainty and scale-sensitive temporal dependencies, thus posing great challenges for accurate prediction of future demands. These in turn make autoscaling challenging---autoscaling needs to properly account for demand uncertainty while maintaining a reasonable trade-off between two contradictory factors, i.e., low instance running costs vs. low QoS violation risks.To address the above challenges, we propose a novel predictive autoscaling framework MagicScaler, consisting of a Multi-scale attentive Gaussian process based predictor and an uncertainty-aware scaler. First, the predictor carefully bridges the best of two successful prediction methodologies---multi-scale attention mechanisms, which are good at capturing complex, multi-scale features, and stochastic process regression, which can quantify prediction uncertainty, thus achieving accurate demand prediction with quantified uncertainty. Second, the scaler takes the quantified future demand uncertainty into a judiciously designed loss function with stochastic constraints, enabling flexible trade-off between running costs and QoS violation risks. Extensive experiments on three clusters of Alibaba Cloud in different Chinese cities demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MagicScaler, which outperforms other commonly adopted scalers, thus justifying our design choices.},

abstract = {Agriculture-based Internet of Things (Ag-IoT) can generate near-real-time quantitative data to analyze crop growth. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based mobile edge computing systems is widely used in Ag-IoT due to the low cost, fast movement and ease of operation of UAVs. Nevertheless, sensors in agriculture may be under a tall and dense crop canopy or under the soil where they have difficulty harvesting a steady of energy and have too worse a channel condition to transmit more data. This paper considers a UAV-Sensor Collaboration Wireless Network (USCWN) in which each UAV carries a computation module and a wireless power transfer module to provide service and energy to sensors. Then, we propose an online resource management framework with two sub-algorithms to maximize the network throughput of USCWN. The first is the sensor fuzzy selection algorithm, which determines which UAV the sensor transmits data to, considering the different resource properties between sensors and UAVs without prior knowledge. The other is a semi-distributed dynamic resource allocation algorithm in which the sensors compete with UAV’s energy, computation, and communication resources in a stochastic game. The UAV acts as a game manager to manage sensor resources. The stochastic game is solved using Lyapunov optimization, which yields a coarse correlated equilibrium that is better than the nash equilibrium. Performance evaluation shows that our proposed framework has a higher network throughput than other agricultural works and maintains stable sensor energy.},

abstract = {Modern vehicles comprise hundreds of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and sensors for enhancing numerous security and comfort-related functionalities. The ECUs perform real-time information exchange, such as automotive instructions over the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. However, the CAN bus architecture supports very limited security features. Thus, in-vehicle communications over CAN are vulnerable to critical security threats. Also, as ECUs are resource-constrained in nature, the continuous message transmissions lead to drain out of energy during inter-ECU communication if the authentication scheme is not cost-effective. This paper proposes AutoSec, a lightweight scheme, exploiting low-cost bit-wise XOR and concatenation operations to facilitate secure and efficient in-vehicle communications for connected vehicles. We show through qualitative analysis that AutoSec preserves the security properties of message integrity, user authentication, and message confidentiality. We implemented AutoSec on Raspberry Pi 3B+ and performed exhaustive experiments to validate the security robustness and lightweightness of AutoSec. The results show that AutoSec reduces the computation time by and energy consumption by .},

abstract = {The use of intelligent sensors and edge devices has grown exponentially for automation in the industry to hyper-personalize applications, minimize cost, improve efficiency, and optimize operations. In a typical Internet-of-Thing (IoT) workflow, pre-trained machine-learning (ML) models are placed on edge devices. These devices have limited resources to serve the incoming load and hence judicious capacity planning is required to address future workloads. This generally results in the over-provisioning or under-provisioning of the resources.Cloud offers a flexible infrastructure for unpredictable workloads faced by on-premise instances but at the cost of increased latency. Fog devices and spatially closer-to-edge devices act as intermediaries to cloud resources with lower latency, however, suffer from capacity planning challenges. These challenges can be mitigated by the use of appropriate cloud services and resource configuration. In this work, we present a Multi-cloud System for Inference Request Management (mSIRM) for the edge-fog-cloud continuum. mSIRM has capabilities for serving dynamically varying machine learning inference workloads using flexible infrastructure across different cloud vendors. Furthermore, we show that the use of multiple clouds with different services in conjunction with the fog computing resources results in a significant drop in Service Level Objective (SLO) violations. Specifically, we compare the edge-cloud frameworks developed using machine learning and serverless platforms from popular cloud service providers.},

abstract = {Going wireless is one of the key industrial trends, which assists the emergence of new manufacturing and maintenance processes by reducing the complexity and cost of physical equipment. However, the adoption of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in production environments is limited due to the strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of industrial applications. In particular, Wireless Avionics Intra-Communication (WAIC) systems operating in 4.3 GHz band are designed for intra-aircraft use cases with considerable restrictions on the transmission power of sensors, which results in multi-hop topologies, complicating a guaranteed QoS. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has developed the protocol stack IPv6 over the Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode of IEEE 802.15.4 (6TiSCH) based on the IEEE 802.15.4 Standard for Low-Rate Wireless Networks, which combines the TSCH reliability with ubiquitous IPv6 connectivity and with the robust Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). The Scheduling Function (SF) is a core IPv6 over the TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4 (6TiSCH) component, but the specification of the SF is an open research topic: numerous scientific articles investigated how QoS for a wide range of applications can be met by developing specialized SFs. However, no full-scale information exchange between the layers of the 6TiSCH stack was considered to optimize the SFs and to improve the network performance. In this work, we propose a novel solution named 6TiSCH-CLX to satisfy demanding QoS requirements using cross-layer communication. It is an extension of the 6TiSCH framework at the network and Medium Access Control (MAC) layers, addressing latency and reliability challenges agnostic of the physical layer. 6TiSCH-CLX is evaluated both analytically and in simulations for several safety-critical avionic intra-communication use cases in WAIC. Preliminary results indicate considerable improvements to latency, while maintaining almost 100% Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) without retransmissions and they highlight the capability of the cross-layer approach compared to existing solutions.},

abstract = {The construction of power system sensing network requires high reliability, long-distance and low-cost sensing network. The characteristics of Long Range (LoRa) are very suitable for the construction of new power systems. However, LoRa is vulnerable to be attacked by jammer. In order to ensure the security and stability of the network, it is necessary to study the anti-jamming technology of Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). In practice, it is difficult to know the jamming mode of jammer clearly, but reinforcement learning can effectively deal with jamming attacks without knowing the jamming model. In this paper, an anti-jamming strategy based on reinforcement learning is proposed to cope with jamming in power system sensing network. The scheme takes the total system capacity as a utility function. Facing unknown jamming models in power system sensing network, reinforcement learning can obtain the optimal anti-jamming scheme through continuous trial and error, and can improve the total system capacity. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by simulation. Compared with the random anti-jamming strategy, anti-jamming scheme based on reinforcement learning is found to be effective against jamming and the total system capacity is greatly improved.},

Recent advances advocate the use of high-resolution sensors to monitor robot operations, which however require invasive retrofit to the robots. To overcome this predicament, we present RobotScatter, a non-intrusive system that exploits the nonlinear effect of RF circuits to fuse the propagation of backscatter tags attached to the robot to defend against active attacks. Specifically, the backscatter propagation interacted by the tags significantly depends on various movement operations, which can be captured with the nonlinearity at the receiver to uniquely determine its identity and the spatial movement trajectory. RobotScatter then profiles the robot movements to verify whether the received movement information matches the backscatter signatures, and thus detects the threat. We implement RobotScatter on two common robotic platforms, Universal Robot and iRobot Create, with over 1,500 operation cycles. The experiment results show that RobotScatter detects up to 94% of anomalies against small movement deviations of 10mm/s in velocity, and 2.6cm in distance.},

abstract = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have the ability to generate images that are visually indistinguishable from real images. However, recent studies have revealed that generated and real images share significant differences in the frequency domain. In this article, we argue that the frequency gap is caused by the high-frequency sensitivity of the discriminator. According to our observation, during the training of most GANs, severe high-frequency differences make the discriminator focus on high-frequency components excessively, which hinders the generator from fitting the low-frequency components that are important for learning images’ content. Then, we propose two simple yet effective image pre-processing operations in the frequency domain for eliminating the side effects caused by high-frequency differences in GANs training: High-frequency Confusion (HFC) and High-frequency Filter (HFF). The proposed operations are general and can be applied to most existing GANs at a fraction of the cost. The advanced performance of the proposed operations is verified on multiple loss functions, network architectures, and datasets. Specifically, the proposed HFF achieves significant improvements of 42.5% FID on CelebA (128*128) unconditional generation based on SNGAN, 30.2% FID on CelebA unconditional generation based on SSGAN, and 69.3% FID on CelebA unconditional generation based on InfoMAXGAN. Furthermore, we also adopt HFF as the first attempt at data augmentation in the frequency domain for contrastive learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on unconditional generation.

abstract = {Besides the conventional communication function, wireless signals are actively exploited for sensing purposes recently. However, a missing component of existing wireless sensing is sensing under device motions. This is challenging because device motions can easily overwhelm target motions such as chest displacement used for respiration sensing. This paper takes a first step in the direction of involving device mobility into the ecosystem of wireless sensing. Owning to the miniaturization and low cost of ultra-wideband (UWB) chip in recent years, we propose to integrate the accuracy of UWB sensing with mobility to support truly ubiquitous wireless sensing. We propose Mobi2Sense, a system design to support sensing under device motions. We propose novel signal processing schemes to remove the effect of device motions on sensing and prototype Mobi2Sense using commodity UWB hardware. Real-world applications demonstrate that even in the presence of device motions, fine-grained Mobi2Sense is able to capture subtle target motions to "hear" music, "see" human respiration, and "recognize" multi-target gestures at a high accuracy.},

abstract = {Research on transferring the learned person re-identification (ReID) model in the source domain to other domains is of great importance since deploying a ReID model to a new scenario is common in practical applications. Most of existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods for person ReID employ the framework of pre-training in the source domain, and clustering and fine-tuning in the target domain. However, how to reduce the intra-domain variations and narrow the inter-domain gaps is far from solved and remains a challenging problem under this framework. In this paper, we address these issues from two aspects. Firstly, a voted-mask guided image channel shuffling strategy for data augmentation is proposed to enhance visual diversity, where image channel shuffling is used as an efficient tool to bridge the inter-domain gap, and voted masks are employed to extract the foregrounds of pedestrian images to relief the negative effects of various backgrounds for reducing the intra-domain variations. Secondly, a novel plug-and-play metric named adaptive camera margin is proposed to fully exploit the low-cost camera tags for producing high-quality pseudo labels, which can significantly reduce the intra-domain variations without extra training cost. Specifically, the proposed network consists of a sensitive branch and an adaptive branch accompanied with our strategy of data augmentation, which are embedded into a joint learning framework to decouple visual representations for better capturing transferable features across different domains in both two stages. Adaptive camera margin is employed to pull samples with different camera IDs closer in the procedure of DBSCAN clustering, which can reduce the influence of intra-domain variations caused by camera shift to a large extent in an effective and efficient manner. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets.

Many resource-constrained sensor nodes function independently to collaborate and maintain wireless networks. Through these networks, essential source information is gathered and transferred to the end users or decision-makers. WSNs have been implemented in different critical applications, such as remote patient health monitoring systems, home automation systems, sales tracking systems, enemy target monitoring and tracking systems, and fire detection system implementations, where the trustworthiness of WSNs becomes very important. These kinds of applications desire to have both comprehensive and accurate data. WSNs may be prone to anomalies as a result of low-cost hardware and software that is unstable, as well as an adverse operating environment that may disrupt the network's communication. It is necessary to identify these anomalies because they can bring about malfunctions in the network and, as a result, impair the quality of the data that has been gathered. In this research, we investigate the anomalies present in WSN, discuss the desirable attributes of anomaly detection approaches, and examine the different anomaly detection strategies that can be applied to wireless sensor networks.},

abstract = {Adaptive sampling is a powerful family of algorithms for managing energy consumption on low-power sensors. These algorithms use captured measurements to control the sensor's collection rate, leading to near-optimal error under energy constraints. Adaptive sampling's data-driven nature, however, comes at a cost in privacy. In this work, we demonstrate how the collection rates of general adaptive policies leak information about captured measurements. Further, individual adaptive policies display this leakage on multiple tasks. This result presents a challenge in maintaining privacy for sensors using energy-efficient batched communication. In this context, the size of measurement batches exposes the sampling policy's collection rate. Thus, an attacker who monitors the encrypted link between sensor and server can use message lengths to uncover information about the captured values. We address this side-channel by introducing a framework called Adaptive Group Encoding (AGE) that protects any periodic adaptive sampler. AGE uses quantization to encode all batches as fixed-length messages, making message sizes independent of the collection rate. AGE reduces the quantization error through a series of transformations. The proposed framework preserves the low error of adaptive sampling while preventing information leakage and incurring negligible energy overhead.},

abstract = {Sensing systems powered by energy harvesting have traditionally been designed to tolerate long periods without energy. As the Internet of Things (IoT) evolves toward a more transient and opportunistic execution paradigm, reducing energy storage costs will be key for its economic and ecologic viability. However, decreasing energy storage in harvesting systems introduces reliability issues. Transducers only produce intermittent energy at low voltage and current levels, making guaranteed task completion a challenge. Existing ad hoc methods overcome this by buffering enough energy either for single tasks, incurring large data-retention overheads, or for one full application cycle, requiring a large energy buffer. We present Julienning: an automated method for optimizing the total energy cost of batteryless applications. Using a custom specification model, developers can describe transient applications as a set of atomically executed kernels with explicit data dependencies. Our optimization flow can partition data- and energy-intensive applications into multiple execution cycles with bounded energy consumption. By leveraging interkernel data dependencies, these energy-bounded execution cycles minimize the number of system activations and nonvolatile data transfers, and thus the total energy overhead. We validate our methodology with two batteryless cameras running energy-intensive machine learning applications. Using a solar testbed, we replay real-world illuminance traces to experimentally demonstrate optimized batteryless execution with a transducer-to-application energy efficiency of 74.5%. Partitioning results demonstrate that compared to ad hoc solutions, our method can reduce the required energy storage by over 94% while only incurring a 0.12% energy overhead.},

abstract = {Vision-language pre-trained (VLP) models have been the foundation of numerous vision-language tasks. Given their prevalence, it becomes imperative to assess their adversarial robustness, especially when deploying them in security-crucial real-world applications. Traditionally, adversarial perturbations generated for this assessment target specific VLP models, datasets, and/or downstream tasks. This practice suffers from low transferability and additional computation costs when transitioning to new scenarios.In this work, we thoroughly investigate whether VLP models are commonly sensitive to imperceptible perturbations of a specific pattern for the image modality. To this end, we propose a novel black-box method to generate Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs), which is so called the &lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt;ffective and &lt;u&gt;T&lt;/u&gt;ransferable &lt;u&gt;U&lt;/u&gt;niversal Adversarial Attack (ETU), aiming to mislead a variety of existing VLP models in a range of downstream tasks. The ETU comprehensively takes into account the characteristics of UAPs and the intrinsic cross-modal interactions to generate effective UAPs. Under this regime, the ETU encourages both global and local utilities of UAPs. This benefits the overall utility while reducing interactions between UAP units, improving the transferability. To further enhance the effectiveness and transferability of UAPs, we also design a novel data augmentation method named ScMix. ScMix consists of self-mix and cross-mix data transformations, which can effectively increase the multi-modal data diversity while preserving the semantics of the original data. Through comprehensive experiments on various downstream tasks, VLP models, and datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method is able to achieve effective and transferrable universal adversarial attacks.},

abstract = {In order to better assist the rehabilitation treatment of patients with musculoskeletal injury, standard rehabilitation actions are needed to guide the musculoskeletal rehabilitation process. With more and more urgent demands, the musculoskeletal rehabilitation evaluation systems have attracted a high degree of attention. Experts have proposed a series of systems based on laser, ultrasound, and image, which can give reasonable recognition and judgment. However, these systems either require specialized and expensive equipment or can be affected by ionizing radiation. How to construct a musculoskeletal rehabilitation evaluation system with low cost, good effect, and little injury is still a great challenge. In this article, we propose MSEva, a musculoskeletal rehabilitation evaluation system based on EMG signals. Specifically, the system uses EMG sensors to collect a large amount of data for five rehabilitation actions. Secondly, MSEva uses Wavelet Transform (WT) to extract the signal features and then puts the processed data into the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for model training. Finally, the system uses the LSTM model to evaluate the normality of the EMG response of rehabilitation actions. The results show that the average accuracy of MSEva reaches 94.37%, which has important evaluation value in guiding the rehabilitation of musculoskeletal patients.},

abstract = {Recent advances in deep learning have granted unrivaled performance to sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR). However, in a real-world scenario, the HAR solution is subject to diverse changes over time such as the need to learn new activity classes or variations in the data distribution of the already-included activities. To solve these issues, previous studies have tried to apply directly the continual learning methods borrowed from the computer vision domain, where it is vastly explored. Unfortunately, these methods either lead to surprisingly poor results or demand copious amounts of computational resources, which is infeasible for the low-cost resource-constrained devices utilized in HAR. In this paper, we provide a resource-efficient and high-performance continual learning solution for HAR. It consists of an expandable neural network trained with a replay-based method that utilizes a highly-compressed replay memory whose samples are selected to maximize data variability. Experiments with four open datasets, which were conducted on two distinct microcontrollers, show that our method is capable of achieving substantial accuracy improvements over baselines in continual learning such as Gradient Episodic Memory, while utilizing only one-third of the memory and being up to 3\texttimes{} faster.},

This disease is a long-term inflammatory disease, and most people are not paying attention. Electrochemical biosensors have multiple advantages like low cost, rapid response, simplicity, high sensitivity and ease to use. Therefore, it is the best method used to detect congenital asthma. Metalloproteinase 33 (ADAM33) is an asthma susceptibility gene in a human's chromosome. Multiple studies have shown that the ADAM33’s overexpression could lead to two SNPs (rs2280090 and rs2280091) mutations appearing and causing congenital asthma. Therefore, discovering these two SNPs in the body represent the body has congenital asthma possible. In this study, two methods are showed to detect pathologies SNPs from unknown samples.},

abstract = {Fall detection is one of the main issues for the elder's health care systems because of its economic and social impact. Whereas the primary metric of such a system remains its accuracy in terms of good detection of falls and avoiding either false detection or missing detection, its deployment raises many issues in terms of the number of devices, their nature (scalar, multimedia, Lidar, etc.) and the technique used. Generally, techniques based on multimedia processing provide better results but at the expense of a high CPU processing and consequently need appropriate devices. This paper explores an approach that uses less-powerful affordable devices (i.e., Raspberry Pi like) with multimedia sensors (i.e., Kinect) and a Deep Learning-based processing mechanism. More precisely, we applied LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) on features extracted from the time series data acquired from the Kinect. Experimental results we obtained from our lightweight LSTM model on the Raspberry pi show that geometric features are more relevant for fall event detection. Our model achieves advanced performance with metrics that are usually considered (accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity). Furthermore, our lightweight model is very promising for deployment on machines considered "low-cost."},

The sensor yielded robust performance with error rates below 1%. The overall median activation time (AT) was 2.35 s with a minuscule difference between one or nine concurrent targets. We discuss whether the method might supplement camera-based gaze interaction, for example, in gaze typing or wheelchair control, and note some limitations, such as a slow AT, the difficulty of calibration with thick hair, and the limit of 10 concurrent targets.},

However, current learning-based approaches on RFID sensing require significant efforts in data collection, feature extraction, and model training. To save data processing effort, we present MicroFluID, a novel RFID artifact based on a multiple-chip structure and microfluidic switches, which informs the input state by directly reading variable ID information instead of retrieving primitive signals. Fabricated on flexible substrates, four types of microfluidic switch circuits are designed to respond to external physical events, including pressure, bend, temperature, and gravity. By default, chips are disconnected into the circuit owing to the reserved gaps in transmission line. While external input or status change occurs, conductive liquid floating in the microfluidics channels will fill the gap(s), creating a connection to certain chip(s). In prototyping the device, we conducted a series of simulations and experiments to explore the feasibility of the multi-chip tag design, key fabrication parameters, interaction performance, and users' perceptions.},

abstract = {The performance of mobile devices directly affects billions of people worldwide.  Yet, despite memory management being key to their responsiveness, energy efficiency, and cost, mobile devices are understudied in the literature.  A paucity of suitable methodologies and benchmarks is likely both a cause and a consequence of this gap.  It also reflects the challenges of evaluating mobile devices due to: i) their inherently multi-tenanted nature, ii) the scarcity of widely-used open source workloads suitable as benchmarks, iii) the challenge of determinism and reproducibility given mobile devices' extensive use of GPS and network services, iv) the complexity of mobile performance criteria.    We study this problem using the Android Runtime (ART), which is particularly interesting because it is open sourced, garbage collected, and its market extends from the most advanced to the most basic mobile devices available, with a commensurate diversity of performance expectations.  Our study makes the following contributions: i) we identify pitfalls and challenges to the sound evaluation of garbage collection in ART, ii) we describe a framework for the principled performance evaluation of overheads in ART, iii) we curate a small benchmark suite comprised of widely-used real-world applications, and iv) we conduct an evaluation of these real-world workloads as well as some DaCapo benchmarks and a micro-benchmark.  For a modestly sized heap, we find that the lower bound on garbage collection overheads vary considerably among the benchmarks we evaluate, from 2&nbsp;% to 51&nbsp;%, and that overall, overheads are similar to those identified in recent studies of Java workloads running on OpenJDK.  We hope that this work will demystify the challenges of studying memory management in the Android Runtime.  By doing so, we hope to open up research and lead to more innovation in this highly impactful and memory-sensitive domain.},

abstract = {We envision a marketplace where diverse entities offer specialized "modules" through APIs, allowing users to compose the outputs of these modules for complex tasks within a given budget. This paper studies the market design problem in such an ecosystem, where module owners strategically set prices for their APIs (to maximize their profit) and a central platform orchestrates the aggregation of module outputs at query-time. One can also think about this as a first-price procurement auction with budgets. The first observation is that if the platform's algorithm is to find the optimal set of modules then this could result in a poor outcome, in the sense that there are price equilibria which provide arbitrarily low value for the user. We show that under a suitable version of the "bang-per-buck" algorithm for the knapsack problem, an ε-approximate equilibrium always exists, for any arbitrary ε &gt; 0. Further, our first main result shows that with this algorithm any such equilibrium provides a constant approximation to the optimal value that the buyer could get under various constraints including (i) a budget constraint and (ii) a budget and a matroid constraint. This can also be interpreted as a price of anarchy result for budget-constrained first-price procurement auctions. Finally, we demonstrate that these approximately efficient equilibria can be learned through decentralized price adjustments by module owners using no-regret learning algorithms.},

Deploying VNFs over the CCF can enhance network performance and Quality of Service (QoS) for modern delay-sensitive applications and use cases in 6G networks. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown potential to automate Virtual Network Function (VNF) migrations by learning optimal policies through continuous monitoring of the network environment. In this work, we leverage Deep Reinforcement Learning to optimize network control policies that continuously update VNF placement for optimal Service Function Chain (SFC) deployment in time-varying user traffic scenarios. By leveraging dynamic VNF relocation, this approach seeks to improve network performance in terms of latency, operational costs, scalability, and flexibility. This study addresses the gap in existing solutions by jointly considering network performance requirements and migration costs, providing a more comprehensive strategy for efficient VNF deployment and management. We show that our proposed DRL-based VNF deployment method achieves a 28.8% lower delay and a 34% lower migration overhead compared to state-of-the-art baselines in a broad range of large-scale simulated scenarios, showing the proposed method's scalability features.},

In this work, we describe a technique to predict emotional states in Russell’s two-dimensional emotion space (valence and arousal), using electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), and electromyography (EMG) signals. For each of the two dimensions, the proposed method uses a classification scheme based on two Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), with the first one trained using positive samples, and the second one using negative samples. The class of new unseen samples is then decided based on which model returns the highest score. The proposed approach was validated on a recently published dataset that contained physiological signals recordings (EEG, ECG, EMG) acquired during a human-horse interaction experiment. The experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves a better performance than the published baseline methods, achieving an F1-score of 0.940 for valence and 0.783 for arousal, an improvement of more than + 0.12 in both cases.},

abstract = {Against the backdrop of the rapid development of big data technology, the phenomenon of price discrimination, colloquially known as "big data-enabled price gouging," has sparked widespread social concern and a crisis of consumer trust. To investigate this issue and seek solutions, this study combines traditional empirical analysis with cutting-edge machine learning simulation. First, through questionnaire surveys and regression analysis, and based on equity theory and price sensitivity theory, we verify the direct negative impact of big data-driven price discrimination on customer loyalty, revealing the mediating role of perceived unfairness and the moderating role of price sensitivity. Second, based on these empirical results, we construct a high-fidelity market simulation environment and employ the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm from Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to train a dynamic pricing agent. The agent's objective is to maximize long-term profit while maintaining customer loyalty. The simulation results show that the trained reinforcement learning strategy significantly outperforms both myopic greedy pricing and fixed-price strategies in terms of total revenue and customer retention. The final policy learned by the agent confirms that to maintain long-term customer relationships, it is necessary to offer discounts to price-sensitive, low-loyalty users while adopting moderate pricing for high-loyalty users, thereby effectively validating our initial theoretical hypotheses. This study not only reveals the internal mechanism through which price discrimination affects customer loyalty but also provides a scientific basis and practical path for enterprises to optimize pricing and achieve sustainable development using advanced algorithms.},

Unattended sleep monitoring at home with low-cost sensors can be leveraged for condition detection, and Machine Learning offers a generalized solution for this task. However, patient characteristics, lack of sufficient training data, and other factors can imply a domain shift between training and end-user data and reduced task performance. In this work, we address this issue with the aim to achieve personalization based on the patient’s needs. We present an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) solution with the constraint that labeled source data are not directly available. Instead, a classifier trained on the source data is provided. Our solution iteratively labels target data sub-regions based on classifier beliefs, and trains new classifiers from the expanding dataset. Experiments with sleep monitoring datasets and various sensors show that our solution outperforms the classifier trained on the source domain, with a kappa coefficient improvement from 0.012 to 0.242. Additionally, we apply our solution to digit classification DA between three well-established datasets, to investigate its generalizability, and allow for related work comparisons. Even without direct access to the source data, it outperforms several well-established UDA methods in these datasets.},

abstract = {Accurate day-ahead electricity price prediction is fundamental for power market operations and policy formulation, where publicly available market data and meteorological factors are critical inputs. To fully leverage these heterogeneous features and address the varying contributions of distinct factors, this study proposes a novel electricity price prediction framework that integrates modal decomposition, reconstruction, and deep learning-based multiple neural network fusion. First, the ReliefF algorithm is employed to identify sensitive features by quantifying the relevance of market and meteorological variables to price fluctuations. Subsequently, the Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) was applied to decompose historical sequences into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Second, the sample entropy of each IMF was calculated, followed by K-means clustering to categorize the IMFs into three classes: high-, medium-, and low-frequency components. The high-frequency components are further decomposed using Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) to enhance feature granularity, and all processed subcomponents are reconstructed. Finally, each reconstructed subcomponent was independently fed into a hybrid model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and attention mechanisms for individualized temporal modeling. Validated on the Danish electricity market dataset, the experimental results demonstrate superior performance: the proposed method achieves prediction accuracies exceeding 92% across all seasons, with a peak accuracy of 96.868%. This study provides a reliable solution for electricity price forecasting in modern power markets characterized by increasing renewable integration.},

However, applying machine learning algorithms to sensing devices presents substantial challenges due to resource constraints and privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) emerges as a promising solution allowing for training models in a distributed manner while preserving data privacy on client devices. We contribute SAFI, a semi-asynchronous FL approach based on clustering to achieve a novel in-cluster synchronous and out-cluster asynchronous FL training mode. Specifically, we propose a three-tier architecture to enable IoT data processing on edge devices and design a clustering selection module to effectively group heterogeneous edge devices based on their processing capacities. The performance of SAFI has been extensively evaluated through experiments conducted on a real-world testbed. As the heterogeneity of edge devices increases, SAFI surpasses the baselines in terms of the convergence time, achieving a speedup of approximately \texttimes{} 3 when the heterogeneity ratio is 7:1. Moreover, SAFI demonstrates favorable performance in non-independent and identically distributed settings and requires lower communication cost compared to FedAsync. Notably, SAFI is the first Java-implemented FL approach and holds significant promise to serve as an efficient FL algorithm in IoT environments.},

abstract = {Human health is closely associated with their daily behavior and environment. However, keeping a healthy lifestyle is still challenging for most people as it is difficult to recognize their living behaviors and identify their surrounding situations to take appropriate action. Human activity recognition is a promising approach to building a behavior model of users, by which users can get feedback about their habits and be encouraged to develop a healthier lifestyle. In this paper, we present a smart light wearable badge with six kinds of sensors, including an infrared array sensor MLX90640 offering privacy-preserving, low-cost, and non-invasive features, to recognize daily activities in a realistic unmodified kitchen environment. A multi-channel convolutional neural network (MC-CNN) based on data and feature fusion methods is applied to classify 14 human activities associated with potentially unhealthy habits. Meanwhile, we evaluate the impact of the infrared array sensor on the recognition accuracy of these activities. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed work to detect the 14 activities performed by ten volunteers with an average accuracy of 92.44 % and an F1 score of 88.27 %.},

By leveraging the emerging low-cost RGB-D cameras and mmWave radars, we propose the first-of-its-kind vision-RF system for cross-modal multi-person ReID at the same time. Firstly, to address the fundamental inter-modality discrepancy, we propose a novel signature synthesis algorithm based on the observed specular reflection model of a human body. Secondly, an effective cross-modal deep metric learning model is introduced to deal with interference caused by unsynchronized data across radars and cameras. Through extensive experiments in both indoor and outdoor environments, we demonstrate that our proposed system is able to achieve ~ 92.5% top-1 accuracy and ~ 97.5% top-5 accuracy out of 56 volunteers. We also show that our proposed system is able to robustly reidentify subjects even when multiple subjects are present in the sensors' field of view.},

At each period, a new batch of data is combined with the cumulative data and the parameters are re-estimated with higher precision. The system requires the decision variable to be selected in all periods. Therefore, it is sensible for the decision-maker to update the decision variable at each period by solving a more precise SO problem with the updated parameter estimate to reduce the performance loss with respect to the target system. We define this decision-making process as the multi-period SO problem and introduce a multi-period stochastic approximation (SA) framework that generates a sequence of solutions. Two algorithms are proposed: Re-start SA (ReSA) reinitializes the stepsize sequence in each period, whereas Warm-start SA (WaSA) carefully tunes the stepsizes, taking both fewer and shorter gradient-descent steps in later periods as parameter estimates become increasingly more precise. We show that under suitable strong convexity and regularity conditions, ReSA and WaSA achieve the best possible convergence rate in expected sub-optimality either when an unbiased or a simultaneous perturbation gradient estimator is employed, while WaSA accrues significantly lower computational cost as the number of periods increases. In addition, we present the regularized ReSA, which obviates the need to know the strong convexity constant and achieves the same convergence rate at the expense of additional computation.},

Most existing studies primarily focus on generating road networks in open areas like main roads and avenues, but little attention has been given to the generation of community road networks in closed areas such as residential areas, which becomes more and more significant due to the growing demand for door-to-door services such as food delivery. This lack of research is primarily attributed to challenges related to sensing data availability and quality. In this paper, we design a novel framework called SmallMap that leverages ubiquitous multi-modal sensing data from last-mile delivery to automatically generate community road networks with low costs. Our SmallMap consists of two key modules: (1) a Trajectory of Interest Detection module enhanced by exploiting multi-modal sensing data collected from the delivery process; and (2) a Dual Spatio-temporal Generative Adversarial Network module that incorporates Trajectory of Interest by unsupervised road network adaptation to generate road networks automatically. To evaluate the effectiveness of SmallMap, we utilize a two-month dataset from one of the largest logistics companies in China. The extensive evaluation results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a precision of 90.5%, a recall of 87.5%, and an F1-score of 88.9%, respectively. Moreover, we conduct three case studies in Beijing City for courier workload estimation, Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) in last-mile delivery, and fine-grained order assignment.},

abstract = {This paper presents Flame, a hardware/software co-designed resilience scheme for protecting GPUs against soft errors. For low-cost yet high-performance resilience, Flame uses acoustic sensors and idempotent processing for error detection and recovery, respectively. That is, Flame seeks to correct any sensor-detected errors by re-executing the idempotent region where they occurred. To achieve this, it is essential for each idempotent region to ensure the absence of errors before moving on to the next region. This is so-called soft error verification that takes sensors' worst-case detection latency (WCDL) to verify each region finished. Rather than waiting for WCDL at each region end, which incurs too much performance overhead, Flame proposes WCDL-aware warp scheduling that can hide the error verification delay (i.e., WCDL) with GPU's inherent massive warp-level parallelism. When a warp hits each idempotent region boundary, Flame deschedules the warp and switches to one of the other ready warps---as if the region boundary were a regular long-latency operation triggering the warp switching. By leveraging GPU's inherent ability for the latency hiding, Flame can completely eliminate the verification delay without significant hardware modification. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance overhead of Flame is near zero, i.e., 0.6% on average for 34 GPU benchmark applications.},

abstract = {Backscatter communication enables miniature, batteryless, and low-cost wireless sensors. Since electromagnetic waves are strongly attenuated in several scenarios, backscatter communication in metals via acoustic waves can leverage various applications, e. g., in structural health monitoring. When backscattering, the Tag has little control over the modulation it performs on the carrier wave. Therefore, existing approaches commonly employ differential binary modulation schemes, limiting the achievable data rates. To overcome this limitation, we derive a channel model that accurately describes the modulation in an acoustic backscatter channel---as, e. g., found in steel beams---and leverage it to achieve higher-order load modulation. We present an open-source Reader and Tag pair prototype based on COTS components that we have developed for communication and on-the-fly channel characterization. We explore the influence of various parameters on communication performance on different channels. Moreover, (i) we are the first to demonstrate that acoustic backscatter is feasible in guided-wave channels, covering up to 3 meters, and that (ii) our modulation scheme achieves up to 211% higher data rates than binary modulation schemes, and (iii) provides reliable communication through channel coding.},

abstract = {Defocus blur detection (DBD) aims to segment the blurred regions from a given image affected by defocus blur. It is a crucial pre-processing step for various computer vision tasks. With the increasing popularity of small mobile devices, there is a need for a computationally efficient method to detect defocus blur accurately. We propose an efficient defocus blur detection method that estimates the probability of each pixel being focused or blurred in resource-constraint devices. Despite remarkable advances made by the recent deep learning-based methods, they still suffer from several challenges such as background clutter, scale sensitivity, indistinguishable low-contrast focused regions from out-of-focus blur, and especially high computational cost and memory requirement. To address the first three challenges, we develop a novel deep network that efficiently detects blur map from the input blurred image. Specifically, we integrate multi-scale features in the deep network to resolve the scale ambiguities and simultaneously modeled the non-local structural correlations in the high-level blur features. To handle the last two issues, we eventually frame our DBD algorithm to perform knowledge distillation by transferring information from the larger teacher network to a compact student network. All the networks are adversarially trained in an end-to-end manner to enforce higher order consistencies between the output and the target distributions. Experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the larger teacher network, while our proposed lightweight DBD model imitates the output of the teacher network without significant loss in accuracy. The codes, pre-trained model weights, and the results will be made publicly available.},

abstract = {Arm posture tracking is essential for many applications, such as gesture recognition, fitness training, and motion-based controls. Smartwatches with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors (i.e., accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer) provide a convenient way to track the orientation and location of the wrist. Existing orientation estimations are based on predefined data fusion methods that do not consider the variations in the data quality of different IMU sensors. Existing location estimations rely on the estimated orientation results. A small orientation estimation error may cause high inaccuracy in location estimation. Moreover, these location estimation algorithms, e.g., Hidden Markov Model and Particle Filters, cannot provide real-time tracking on commercial mobile devices due to high computation overhead. This paper presents RTAT, a Real-Time Arm Tracking system that tackles the above limitations in a data-driven way. RTAT estimates both orientation and location simultaneously using a multitask learning neural network. It also incorporates a unique attention layer and a dedicated loss function to learn the dynamic relationship among IMU sensors. RTAT supports real-time tracking by performing model inference on smartphones. Finally, to train RTAT's neural network, we develop an easy-to-use labeled data collection system that uses a low-cost virtual reality system to provide orientation and location labels for the smartwatch. Extensive experiments show RTAT significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions in both accuracy and latency.},

abstract = {This article addresses the general problem of built heritage protection against both deterioration and loss. To continuously monitor and update the structural health status, a crowd-sensing solution based on powerful and automatic deep learning technique is proposed. The aim of this solution is to get rid of the limitations of manual and visual damage detection methods that are costly and time-consuming. Instead, automatic visual inspection for damage detection on walls is efficiently and effectively performed using an embedded Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This CNN detects the most frequent types of surface damage on wall photos. The study has been conducted in the Kasbah of Algiers where the four following types of damages have been considered: Efflorescence, spall, crack, and mold. The CNN is designed and trained to be integrated into a mobile application for a participatory crowd-sensing solution. The application should be widely and freely deployed, so any user can take a picture of a suspected damaged wall and get an instant and automatic diagnosis through the embedded CNN. In this context, we have chosen MobileNetV2 with a transfer learning approach. A set of real images have been collected and manually annotated and have been used for training, validation, and test. Extensive experiments have been conducted to assess the efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed solution, using a 5-fold cross-validation procedure. Obtained results show in particular a mean weighted average precision of 0.868 ± 0.00862 (with a 99% of confidence level) and a mean weighted average recall of 0.84 ± 0.00729 (with a 99% of confidence level). To evaluate the performance of MobileNetV2 as a feature extractor, we conducted a comparative study with other small backbones. Further analysis of CNN activation using Grad-Cam has also been done. Obtained results show that our method remains effective even when using a small network and medium- to low-resolution images. MobileNetV2-based CNN size is smaller, and computational cost better, compared to the other CNNs, with similar performance results. Finally, detected surface damages have also been plotted on a geographic map, giving a global view of their distribution.},

abstract = {The wide adoption of smart devices and Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors has led to massive growth in data generation at the edge of the Internet over the past decade. Intelligent real-time analysis of such a high volume of data, particularly leveraging highly accurate deep learning (DL) models, often requires the data to be processed as close to the data sources (or at the edge of the Internet) to minimize the network and processing latency. The advent of specialized, low-cost, and power-efficient edge devices has greatly facilitated DL inference tasks at the edge. However, limited research has been done to improve the inference throughput (e.g., number of inferences per second) by exploiting various system techniques. This study investigates system techniques, such as batched inferencing, AI multi-tenancy, and cluster of AI accelerators, which can significantly enhance the overall inference throughput on edge devices with DL models for image classification tasks. In particular, AI multi-tenancy enables collective utilization of edge devices’ system resources (CPU, GPU) and AI accelerators (e.g., Edge Tensor Processing Units; EdgeTPUs). The evaluation results show that batched inferencing results in more than 2.4\texttimes{} throughput improvement on devices equipped with high-performance GPUs like Jetson Xavier NX. Moreover, with multi-tenancy approaches, e.g., concurrent model executions (CME) and dynamic model placements (DMP), the DL inference throughput on edge devices (with GPUs) and EdgeTPU can be further improved by up to 3\texttimes{} and 10\texttimes{}, respectively. Furthermore, we present a detailed analysis of hardware and software factors that change the DL inference throughput on edge devices and EdgeTPUs, thereby shedding light on areas that could be further improved to achieve high-performance DL inference at the edge.},

abstract = {Speculative execution attacks undermine the security of constant-time programming, the standard technique used to prevent microarchitectural side channels in security-sensitive software such as cryptographic code. Constant-time code must therefore also deploy a defense against speculative execution attacks to prevent leakage of secret data stored in memory or the processor registers. Unfortunately, contemporary defenses, such as speculative load hardening (SLH), can only satisfy this strong security guarantee at a very high performance cost.This paper proposes Declassiflow, a static program analysis and protection framework to efficiently protect constant-time code from speculative leakage. Declassiflow models "attacker knowledge"-data which is inherently transmitted (or, implicitly declassified) by the code's non-speculative execution-and statically removes protection on such data from points in the program where it is already guaranteed to leak non-speculatively. Overall, Declassiflow ensures that data which never leaks during the non-speculative execution does not leak during speculative execution, but with lower overhead than conservative protections like SLH.},

abstract = {Identity recognition is increasingly used to control access to sensitive data, restricted areas in industrial, healthcare, and defense settings, as well as in consumer electronics. To this end, existing approaches are typically based on collecting and analyzing biometric data and imply severe privacy concerns. Particularly when cameras are involved, users might even reject or dismiss an identity recognition system. Furthermore, iris or fingerprint scanners, cameras, microphones, etc., imply installation and maintenance costs and require the user's active participation in the recognition procedure. This paper proposes a non-intrusive identity recognition system based on analyzing WiFi's Channel State Information (CSI). We show that CSI data attenuated by a person's body and typical movements allows for a reliable identification - even in a sitting posture. We further propose a lightweight deep learning algorithm trained using CSI data, which we implemented and evaluated on an embedded platform (i.e., a Raspberry Pi 4B). Our results obtained using real-world experiments suggest a high accuracy in recognizing people's identity, with a specificity of 98% and a sensitivity of 99%, while requiring a low training effort and negligible cost.},

abstract = {Many consumer products such as wearable and disposable electronics require flexibility, biocompatibility and ultra low-costs, which can hardly be matched by silicon electronics. Therefore, printed electronics (PE) becomes a competitive candidate thanks to its additive manufacturing. To address fundamental signal-processing tasks, printed neuromorphic circuits (pNCs) have received increasing attention, as they can achieve promising computational capabilities by assembling simple circuit primitives. However, many target domains of PE are based on processing temporal sensory data, which can not be reached by existing pNCs, since they lack components with time dependencies. This paper proposes a printed temporal processing block that combines existing pNCs with learnable filters. We model the proposed circuit and proposed the corresponding training objective to enable their bespoke design. Simulations on 15 benchmark time-series datasets reveal that, the proposed circuits can effectively process temporal data by using&nbsp;1.5 \texttimes{} and&nbsp;1.3 \texttimes{} &nbsp;of device counts and power respectively. The classification accuracy reaches 98% of that from classic Elman recurrent neural networks.},

abstract = {The development of 5G has brought new opportunities for the application of Internet of Things (IoT). The integration of 5G and IoT technologies promote high availability, resilience, and reliability of the network infrastructures. IoT deployment optimization is the core issue of 5G IoT. Traditionally, IoT node deployment methods mostly used disk coverage model or probabilistic detection coverage model, which only utilizes the sensing capability of a single IoT node, which results in higher deployment costs. In this article, we study the network resilience of coverage estimation error and solve the coverage problem of resilient deployment of smart nodes in 5G IoT. The coverage formulation in the deployment optimization method is defined based on the confident information coverage (CIC). In order to obtain the optimal deployment with a given coverage quality and with a given budget, the mixed-integer linear programming models (CICILP-COST) and (CICILP-ERROR) are proposed based on the CIC model. After analyzing the model complexity, the proposed models are solved by the variable relaxation algorithm (CICVR-COST) and dichotomous search algorithm (CICDS-ERROR), respectively. Simulations on air pollution datasets in Lyon, France, show that the proposed model yields a lower cost optimal deployment than existing peer schemes.},

abstract = {Blockchain-based distributed storage systems offer enhanced security, transparency, and lower costs compared to traditional centralized storage, making them ideal for peer-to-peer collaboration. However, with the trend towards the Web of Things (WoT), lower transaction speeds and higher computational requirements limit their access to high-density data such as IoT. To address this, we propose TimeChain, an efficient off-chain blockchain storage system for IoT time series data. TimeChain batches discrete time series data, storing only the hash value of each batch on-chain while keeping the complete data off-chain. This significantly reduces storage overhead on the blockchain and storage latency by 37.4 times. TimeChain adopts an adaptive packaging mechanism to reduce the additional latency in range queries by converting the batch processing problem into a graph partitioning problem. To reduce the overhead of node selection, TimeChain integrates a node selection mechanism based on consensus protocol, combining node selection and consensus processes together. TimeChain also proposes a Locality-Sensitive Hashing tree-based data integrity verification mechanism to reduce transmission size. Our evaluation shows a reduction in query latency by 64.6% and storage latency by 35.3% compared to existing systems.},

In summary, the model performs collaborative optimization on the basis of integrating design and operation data, which can promote the improvement of enterprise benefits.},

Moreover, latency-sensitive services constrain the type and location of edge devices that can provide the needed resources. When available resources are scarce there is a possibility that some resource allocation requests are denied.In this work, we propose the VioLinn system to tackle the joint problems of task placement, service placement, and edge device provisioning. Dealing with latency-sensitive services is achieved through proximity-aware algorithms that ensure the tasks are handled close to the end-user. Moreover, the concept of spare edge device is introduced to handle sudden load variations in time and space without having to continuously overprovision. Several spare device selection algorithms are proposed with different cost/performance tradeoffs.Evaluations are performed both in a Kubernetes-based testbed and using simulations and show the benefit of using spare devices for handling localized load spikes with higher quality of service (QoS) and lower computing resource usage. The study of the different algorithms shows that it is possible to achieve this increase in QoS with different tradeoffs against cost and performance.},

Traditionally, gesture recognition requires expensive sensors to obtain high-precision data, but some applications–such as VR games–do not require high accuracy and users prefer a lower cost instead. Thus some researchers began to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize gestures directly without other calibration equipment. However, using CNN encounters the degradation phenomenon of the neural network. In this paper, we propose a highly-accurate gesture recognition method for low-precision glove data based on Residual neural Networks (ResNet). Our method combines 1D convolution with 2D convolution and adopts a sliding window for sample size constraint to achieve data enhancement. Evaluation results indicate that compared to the CNN method, our method improves the classification accuracy rate from 94.4% to 99.2%.},

Specifically, I-Seed aims at developing a new generation of self-deployable and biodegradable soft miniaturized robots, inspired by the morphology and dispersion abilities of plant seeds, able to perform low-cost, environmentally responsible, in-situ measurements. The natural functional mechanisms of seeds dispersal offer a rich source of robust, highly adaptive, mass and energy efficient mechanisms, and behavioral and morphological intelligence, which can be selected and implemented for advanced, but simple, technological inventions. I-Seed robots are conceived as unique in their movement abilities because inspired by passive mechanisms and materials of natural seeds, and unique in their environmentally friendly design because made of all biodegradable components. Sensing is based on a chemical transduction mechanism in a stimulus-responsive sensor material with fluorescence-based optical readout, which can be read via one or more drones equipped with fluorescent LiDAR technology and a software able to perform a real time georeferencing of data. The I-Seed robotic ecosystem is envisioned to be used for collecting environmental data in-situ with high spatial and temporal resolution across large remote areas where no monitoring data are available, and thus for extending current environmental sensor frameworks and data analysis systems.},

abstract = {Raw flash file systems are essential in today's cost-sensitive embedded systems and legacy embedded devices. The performance of raw flash file systems is often limited by their inefficient garbage collection (GC) due to the tight capacity of the onboard flash memory and CPU computing power. However, in real-world scenarios, we observed that the GC overhead can account for more than 85% of the total I/O time, which not only degrades the performance of the file system but also shortens the endurance of the flash chip. However, existing GC optimization used in high-end SSD or server-side file systems usually leads to high CPU and memory usage, which is not suitable for the embedded environment. In this paper, we propose LightGC, a low-complexity and high-efficiency GC scheme. We design an optimized clustering algorithm for page hotness measurement and a hot-delay GC victim selection strategy. LightGC can also be adapted to locality changes in workloads to maximize the effect of cold and heat separation. Our experimental results show that LightGC offers a relative improvement of up to 19% in GC efficiency, a 5%-15% reduction in write amplification, and a 10%-17% increase in flash memory endurance compared to other existing GC methods. In addition, driven by LightGC, we implement the UBIFS2 file system, an upgraded version of the UBIFS flash file system. We have done careful engineering design so that UBIFS2 and the original UBIFS are compatible with each other and users can switch between them freely.},

To address these issues, we design Geryon, an edge assisted object detection system on drones, which utilizes a suit of approaches to fully exploit the complementary advantages of camera and mmWave radar on three levels: (i) a novel multi-frame compositing approach utilizes camera to assist radar to address the aggravated sparsity and noise of radar point clouds; (ii) a saliency area extraction and encoding approach utilizes radar to assist camera to reduce the bandwidth consumption and offloading latency; (iii) a parallel transmission and inference approach with a lightweight box enhancement scheme further reduces the offloading latency while ensuring the edge-side accuracy-latency trade-off by the parallelism and better camera-radar fusion. We implement and evaluate Geryon with four datasets we collect under foggy/rainy/snowy weather and poor illumination conditions, demonstrating its great advantages over other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both accuracy and latency.},

With the amount increase of sensors and collection data, a large number of low-value data will be directly uploaded to the cloud server without screening in the application process of the Internet of Things, which will waste a lot of network resources. This paper proposes an intelligent processing method of Internet of Things data based on fog computing. Firstly, fog nodes are introduced into the sensor network in the edge of the Internet of Things, and then deep neural network is used as the data processing method in the fog nodes to conduct preliminary classification and screening of the sensor data collected in the edge network. Finally, the processed data is sent to the cloud according to the demand. By comparison, using fog nodes to screen data can greatly reduce the amount of data transmission and meet the needs of data analysis, which is conducive to reducing the cost of the Internet of Things.},

abstract = {Depth estimation has an important role in various applications. Generally, active sensors such as Light Detector and Ranging (LiDAR) or stereo cameras are used in depth estimation. However, they have various drawbacks, primarily the computational cost required. In order to provide lower costs, monocular cameras became the solution. Images captured by monocular cameras, however, do not have depth information, making it impossible to estimate depth values. The success of deep learning in solving various computer vision tasks has been proven and is growing rapidly, one of them is the monocular depth estimation. There are various scenes solved in the case of monocular depth estimation, including indoor and outdoor. In this research, we will focus on indoor scenes due to the fact that the information in indoor scenes is more varied compared to outdoor scenes. This makes indoor scenes more challenging than outdoor scenes. In this research, we use the U-Net architecture by using a pre-trained ResNet at the encoder side. ResNet was chosen because of its proven ability to prevent vanishing and exploding gradients. In this work, we examine ResNet's ability to perform depth estimation and we investigate the impact of using weights in the loss function on the depth map obtained both quantitatively and qualitatively. We use the DIODE dataset: A Dense Indoor and Outdoor Depth Dataset as a benchmark. We achieved quantitative improvement with RMSE of 1.7673, REL of 0.3281, δ&lt;1.25 of 57.38, δ&lt;1.25² of 77.18, and δ&lt;1.25³ of 86.71.},

abstract = {Batteryless image sensors present an opportunity for long-life, long-range sensor deployments that require zero maintenance, and have low cost. Such deployments are critical for enabling remote sensing applications, e.g., instrumenting national highways, where individual devices are deployed far (kms away) from supporting infrastructure. In this work, we develop and characterize Camaroptera, the first batteryless image-sensing platform to combine energy-harvesting with active, long-range (LoRa) communication. We also equip Camaroptera with a Machine Learning-based processing pipeline to mitigate costly, long-distance communication of image data. This processing pipeline filters out uninteresting images and only transmits the images interesting to the application. We show that compared to running a traditional Sense-and-Send workload, Camaroptera’s Local Inference pipeline captures and sends upto  ( 12times )  more images of interest to an application. By performing Local Inference, Camaroptera also sends upto  ( 6.5times )  fewer uninteresting images, instead using that energy to capture upto ( 14.7times )  more new images, increasing its sensing effectiveness and availability. We fully prototype the Camaroptera hardware platform in a compact, 2 cm  ( times )  3 cm  ( times )  5 cm volume. Our evaluation demonstrates the viability of a batteryless, remote, visual-sensing platform in a small package that collects and usefully processes acquired data and transmits it over long distances (kms), while being deployed for multiple decades with zero maintenance.},

abstract = {Cyber-attacks in IoT enabled devices have grown at an alarming rate since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic due to cyber physical digital transformation enabled through widespread deployment of low cost sensor embedded IoT devices in consumer and industrial IOT, as well as increase in computing power. Consequently, this adoption trend had led to 1.51 billion breaches on IoT devices during the first half of 2021 alone. This highlights the critical importance of being prepared for IoT vulnerabilities (IoT manufacturing and deployment sector) and attacks (malicious actors). In this respect machine learning (ML) especially deep learning (DL) strategies has emerged as the preferred methods to secure IoT devices from attacks. In this paper, we propose three deep learning algorithms for IoT intrusion detection based on mapping of IoT attacks to ML/DL methods. Our paper thus provides two contributions. First, we present a model that maps extant research on the application of ML/DL to specific IoT attacks. Second, through an optimal selection of the mapping, we present three algorithms (na\"{\i}ve Bayes, convolutional neural network and autoencoder) for detection of intrusion in IoT attacks. This provides a review of research opportunities and research gaps in the IoT IDS domain.},

abstract = {Reducing sensor requirements while keeping optimal control performance is crucial to many industrial control applications to achieve robust, low-cost, and computation-efficient controllers. However, existing feature selection solutions for the typical machine learning domain can hardly be applied in the domain of control with changing dynamics. In this paper, a novel framework, namely the Dual-world embedded Attentive Feature Selection (D-AFS), can efficiently select the most relevant sensors for the system under dynamic control. Rather than the one world used in most Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms, D-AFS has both the real world and its virtual peer with twisted features. By analyzing the DRL's response in two worlds, D-AFS can quantitatively identify respective features' importance towards control. A well-known active flow control problem, cylinder drag reduction, is used for evaluation. Results show that D-AFS successfully finds an optimized five-probes layout with 18.7% drag reduction than the state-of-the-art solution with 151 probes and 49.2% reduction than five-probes layout by human experts. We also apply this solution to four OpenAI classical control cases. In all cases, D-AFS achieves the same or better sensor configurations than originally provided solutions. Results highlight, we argued, a new way to achieve efficient and optimal sensor designs for experimental or industrial systems.

abstract = {Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) has become a cost-effective and accessible sensor for a broad range of embedded devices including mobile phones and drones. Vision applications of these embedded devices require fast and accurate inferences to drive them, while at the same time power consumption should be kept low. Achieving both these requirements is hard due to the size of high quality LIDAR point cloud data streams - significantly larger than vision inputs such as images. The complexity of point cloud segmentation adds further difficulty for achieving high quality, realtime LIDAR data driven vision applications on battery powered embedded devices. We consider edge offloading as a potential approach to reconcile these conflicting requirements. Specifically, we present an experimental characterization study exploring the benefit of edge-assisted LIDAR point cloud segmentation, considering diverse set of embedded devices and state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models. Our results indicate that edge offloading is always beneficial from a device energy efficiency perspective and can also significantly reduce inference latency, especially with compressive edge offloading. These latency improvements however fall short of meeting real-time requirements. We outline a number of potential follow-on research directions to enable edge assisted accurate and real-time LIDAR point cloud segmentation.},

abstract = {We present a first-of-its-kind end-to-end tele-robotic VR system where the user operates a robot arm remotely, while being virtually immersed into the scene through force feedback and holographic vision. In contrast to stereoscopic head mounted displays that only provide depth perception to the user, the holographic vision device projects a light field, additionally allowing the user to correctly accommodate his/her eyes to the perceived depth of the scene's objects. The highly improved immersive user experience results in less fatigue in the tele-operator's daily work, creating safer and/or longer working conditions. The core technology relies on recent advances in immersive video coding for audio-visual transmission developed within the MPEG standardization committee. Virtual viewpoints are synthesized for the tele-operator's viewing direction from a couple of colour and depth fixed video feeds. Besides of the display hardware and its GPU-enabled view synthesis driver, the biggest challenge hides in obtaining high-quality and reliable depth images from low-cost depth sensing devices. Specialized depth refinement tools have been developed for running in realtime at zero delay within the end-to-end tele-robotic immersive video pipeline, which must remain interactive by essence. Various modules work asynchronously and efficiently at their own pace, with the acquisition devices typically being limited to 30 frames per second (fps), while the holographic headset updates its projected light field at up to 240 fps. Such modular approach ensures high genericity over a wide range of free navigation VR/XR applications, also beyond the tele-robotic one presented in this paper.},

abstract = {Aircraft industry is constantly striving for more efficient design optimization methods in terms of human efforts, computation time, and resources consumption. Hybrid surrogate optimization maintains high results quality while providing rapid design assessments when both the surrogate model and the switch mechanism for eventually transitioning to the HF model are calibrated properly. Feedforward neural networks (FNNs) can capture highly nonlinear input-output mappings, yielding efficient surrogates for aircraft performance factors. However, FNNs often fail to generalize over the out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, which hinders their adoption in critical aircraft design optimization. Through SmOOD, our smoothness-based out-of-distribution detection approach, we propose to codesign a model-dependent OOD indicator with the optimized FNN surrogate, to produce a trustworthy surrogate model with selective but credible predictions. Unlike conventional uncertainty-grounded methods, SmOOD exploits inherent smoothness properties of the HF simulations to effectively expose OODs through revealing their suspicious sensitivities, thereby avoiding over-confident uncertainty estimates on OOD samples. By using SmOOD, only high-risk OOD inputs are forwarded to the HF model for re-evaluation, leading to more accurate results at a low overhead cost. Three aircraft performance models are investigated. Results show that FNN-based surrogates outperform their Gaussian Process counterparts in terms of predictive performance. Moreover, SmOOD does cover averagely of actual OODs on all the study cases. When SmOOD plus FNN surrogates are deployed in hybrid surrogate optimization settings, they result in a decrease error rate of and a computational speed up rate of 58.36 \texttimes{}, respectively.},

abstract = {Gastrointestinal Endoscopy in real-time needs to be done quickly and accurately. During an endoscopic examination, the technical doctor must spend a lot of time classifying anatomical landmarks before proceeding with further work such as lesion detection or abnormal region segmentation. The endoscopist also can ensure the completion of the examination with the help of the anatomical landmarks. In this study, we develop a robust and high-performance neural network classifying ten anatomical landmarks in the Upper Gastrointestinal tract. To this end, the proposed method consists of a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) to learn an efficient (dis)similarity metric of a pair of landmarks. We then propose to use the weight that is learned by SNN to a CNN-based structure for the feature extraction. The proposed CNN-based architecture is a lightweight model of Resnet-18 that is designed to achieve the best performance as well as a low cost of computational time. Finally, we utilize an SVM classifier to automatically classify ten anatomical landmarks from the Upper Gastrointestinal endoscopic images. The dataset used in this study is collected in four lighting modes such as (WLI) White-light Imaging, FICE (Flexible spectral imaging color enhancement), BLI (Blue Light Imaging), and LCI (Linked color imaging). The dataset is labeled by endoscopists with more than five years of experience. To enrich the dataset, we also research and evaluate augmentation techniques as effectively as possible. The augmented data includes a combination of the geometrical transforms and the data generated using CycleGAN deep learning networks. The proposed method works well with four lighting modes without depending on a certain lighting mode. It achieved 96.3% sensitivity, 99.6% specificity, and 99.3% accuracy. As a result of the computational time, we achieved approximately 60 FPS (Frame Per Second) using 20W average power with the deep learning framework Pytorch on the Jetson Xavier AGX.},

Spatio-temporal modulation (STM), the state-of-the-art UMH shape-rendering method, provides large freedom in shape design and produces the strongest possible stimuli for this technology. Yet, STM shapes are often reported to be blurry, complicating shape identification. Dynamic tactile pointers (DTP) were recently introduced as a technique to overcome this issue. By tracing a contour with an amplitude-modulated focal point, they significantly improve shape identification accuracy over STM, but at the cost of much lower stimulus intensity. Building upon this, we propose spatio-temporally-modulated Tactile Pointers (STP), a novel method for rendering clearer and sharper UMH shapes while at the same time producing strong vibrotactile sensations. We ran two human participant experiments, which show that STP shapes are perceived as significantly stronger than DTP shapes, while shape identification accuracy is significantly improved over STM and on par with that obtained with DTP. Our work has implications for effective shape rendering with UMH and provides insights that could inform future psychophysical investigation into vibrotactile shape perception in UMH.},

abstract = {The paper presents distributed algorithms for combined acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) and noise reduction (NR) in a wireless acoustic sensor and actuator network (WASAN) where each node may have multiple microphones and multiple loudspeakers, and where the desired signal is a speech signal. A centralized integrated AEC and NR algorithm, i.e., multichannel Wiener filter (MWF), is used as starting point where echo signals are viewed as background noise signals and loudspeaker signals are used as additional input signals to the algorithm. By including prior knowledge (PK), namely that the loudspeaker signals do not contain any desired signal component, an alternative centralized cascade algorithm (PK-MWF) is obtained with an AEC stage first followed by an MWF-based NR stage which has a lower computational complexity. Distributed algorithms can then be obtained from the MWF and PK-MWF algorithm, i.e., the generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD)-based distributed adaptive node-specific signal estimation (DANSE) and PK-GEVD-DANSE algorithm, respectively. In the former, each node performs a reduced dimensional integrated AEC and NR algorithm and broadcasts only 1 fused signal (instead of all its signals) to the other nodes. In the PK-GEVD-DANSE algorithm, each node performs a reduced dimensional cascade AEC and NR algorithm and broadcasts only 2 fused signals (instead of all its signals) to the other nodes. The distributed algorithms achieve the same performance, upon convergence, as the corresponding centralized integrated (MWF) and centralized cascade (PK-MWF) algorithm. It is observed, however, that the communication cost in the PK-GEVD-DANSE algorithm can also be reduced, where each node then broadcasts only 1 fused signal (instead of 2 signals) to the other nodes. The resulting algorithm, referred to as the pruned PK-GEVD-DANSE (pPK-GEVD-DANSE) algorithm, then effectively combines the lowest possible communication cost (as low as in the GEVD-DANSE algorithm) with a lowest possible computational complexity in each node (further reduced from the PK-GEVD-DANSE computational complexity), within the class of algorithms considered in this paper.},

Our actuator is fully electromagnetically-actuated with a moving tactor that can render three haptic feedbacks through systematically controlling the current inside the flexible PCBs. The actuator can be arranged with varying parts of the body which enriches the potentials to implement promising application scenarios including delivering the notification and providing immersive haptic feedback either in virtual reality or in gameplay. A prototypical technical evaluation demonstrated the mechanical properties of our actuator. We quantitatively conducted a series of psychophysical user studies (N= 12) to reveal the feasibility of our prototype. The overall absolute identification study for distinguishing three sensations accuracy at two body locations reached up to 97.2%.},

abstract = {In order to solve the challenges of high-precision maps based on lidar 3D point clouds, which are expensive on-vehicle sensors and high computing power requirements, the academic community has proposed a cognitive map solution with low cost, small amount of data, and moderate positioning accuracy. The current cognitive map mainly relies on the geometric relationship between road signs and lane lines to complete vehicle positioning, and the local positioning accuracy needs to be further improved. This paper proposes a real-time vectorized map modeling solution, using a vectorized map instead of a discrete point map to support a vehicle positioning solution based on road geometry, thereby improving the local positioning accuracy of the vehicle. At the same time, in order to solve the problem of vehicle global positioning, this paper adopts a location recognition algorithm based on the perspective of the vehicle to complete the global location estimation of the vehicle on a large scale only by relying on the vision, so as to serve the navigation function.},

abstract = {This study integrates macroeconomic, commodity and political geography indicators to form a dataset used by algorithmic models to predict crude oil futures prices. Univariate models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random Forest (RF), ARMA and Holt-Winters, were evaluated for their ability to predict crude oil price volatility. The LSTM model outperformed the others in terms of accuracy and had a low margin of error, while the RF model captured the overall trend but performed poorly during periods of high volatility. The ARMA and Holt-Winters models show limited ability to predict long-term trends and short-term volatility. In multivariate forecasting, the inclusion of additional variables significantly improves the accuracy of the LSTM model, increasing its adaptability to complex price dynamics. In contrast, the RF model shows minimal improvement. In addition, the inclusion of geopolitical factors further improves the performance of the LSTM, demonstrating its adaptability to external market dynamics, while the RF model shows limited sensitivity to these factors, suggesting a reduced ability to deal with geopolitical influences.},

abstract = {Derailments present a frequent phenomenon in several developing countries, which result in massive loss of property along with death tolls. For preventing derailments, a real-time automated system is needed to detect uprooted or faulty rail blocks. One of the solutions in this context is to sense the vibration of the rail track having an incoming train and transmit the information to the train notifying it about the condition of the rail track ahead. However, existing studies in this regard are yet to present a pragmatic solution that enables much-demanded long-distance networking to transmit the sensed data. The demand for long-distance network communication between the sensor nodes and the incoming train is unavoidable, as stopping the train after sensing an uprooted or faulty rail block ahead needs a considerable response time and distance. Therefore, in this paper, we develop a low-cost, long-range, and highly reliable mobile multi-hop networking scheme to successfully transmit data sensed from rail tracks to an approaching train at a distance of around 2000m. By considering the effect of Fresnel’s Region in our study, we determine the suitable placement of the networking module on the rail track, which leads us to achieve a delivery ratio of more than 99%. We confirm this finding through rigorous experiments over a real testbed scenario enabling mobile multi-hop networking.},

abstract = {Recognising and monitoring emotional states play a crucial role in mental health and well-being management. Importantly, with the widespread adoption of smart mobile and wearable devices, it has become easier to collect long-term and granular emotion-related physiological data passively, continuously, and remotely. This creates new opportunities to help individuals manage their emotions and well-being in a less intrusive manner using off-the-shelf low-cost devices. Pervasive emotion recognition based on physiological signals is, however, still challenging due to the difficulty to efficiently extract high-order correlations between physiological signals and users' emotional states. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end emotion recognition system based on a convolution-augmented transformer architecture. Specifically, it can recognise users' emotions on the dimensions of arousal and valence by learning both the global and local fine-grained associations and dependencies within and across multimodal physiological data (including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, heart rate, and skin temperature). We extensively evaluated the performance of our model using the K-EmoCon dataset, which is acquired in naturalistic conversations using off-the-shelf devices and contains spontaneous emotion data. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baselines and achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance. We also demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our system on another affective dataset which used affect inducement and commercial physiological sensors.},

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) aims to improve machine learning privacy by allowing several data owners in edge and ubiquitous computing systems to collaboratively train a model, while preserving their local training data private, and sharing only model training parameters. However, FL systems remain vulnerable to privacy attacks, and in particular, to membership inference attacks that allow adversaries to determine whether a given data sample belongs to participants' training data, thus, raising a significant threat in sensitive ubiquitous computing systems. Indeed, membership inference attacks are based on a binary classifier that is able to differentiate between member data samples used to train a model and non-member data samples not used for training. In this context, several defense mechanisms, including differential privacy, have been proposed to counter such privacy attacks. However, the main drawback of these methods is that they may reduce model accuracy while incurring non-negligible computational costs. In this paper, we precisely address this problem with PASTEL, a FL privacy-preserving mechanism that is based on a novel multi-objective learning function. On the one hand, PASTEL decreases the generalization gap to reduce the difference between member data and non-member data, and on the other hand, PASTEL reduces model loss and leverages adaptive gradient descent optimization for preserving high model accuracy. Our experimental evaluations conducted on eight widely used datasets and five model architectures show that PASTEL significantly reduces membership inference attack success rates by up to -28%, reaching optimal privacy protection in most cases, with low to no perceptible impact on model accuracy.},

abstract = {The most basic lower-bound question in randomized communication complexity is: Does a given problem have constant cost, or non-constant cost? We observe that this question has a deep connection to implicit graph representations in structural graph theory. Specifically, constant-cost communication problems correspond to hereditary graph families that admit constant-size adjacency sketches, or equivalently constant-size probabilistic universal graphs (PUGs), and these graph families are a subset of families that admit adjacency labeling schemes of size O(logn), which are the subject of the well-studied implicit graph question (IGQ). We initiate the study of the hereditary graph families that admit constant-size PUGs, with the two (equivalent) goals of (1) giving a structural characterization of randomized constant-cost communication problems, and (2) resolving a probabilistic version of the IGQ. For each family F studied in this paper (including the monogenic bipartite families, product graphs, interval and permutation graphs, families of bounded twin-width, and others), it holds that the subfamilies H ⊆ F are either stable (in a sense relating to model theory), in which case they admit constant-size PUGs (i.e. adjacency sketches), or they are not stable, in which case they do not. The correspondence between communication problems and hereditary graph families allows for a probabilistic method of constructing adjacency labeling schemes. By this method, we show that the induced subgraphs of any Cartesian products Gd are positive examples to the IGQ, also giving a bound on the number of unique induced subgraphs of any graph product. We prove that this probabilistic construction cannot be ”na\"{\i}vely derandomized” by using an Equality oracle, implying that the Equality oracle cannot simulate the k-Hamming Distance communication protocol. As a consequence of our results, we obtain constant-size sketches for deciding dist(x,y) ≤ k for vertices x,y in any stable graph family with bounded twin-width, answering an open question about planar graphs from earlier work. This generalizes to constant-size sketches for deciding first-order formulas over the same graphs.},

abstract = {In single-zone multi-room houses (SZMRHs), temperature controls rely on a single probe near the thermostat. This practice often results in temperature discrepancies that cause both thermal discomfort and energy waste. Automatic vent registers, among other similar solutions, have faced adoption barriers due to installation, cost, and maintenance constraints. Utilizing per-room sensors with smart thermostats (STs) to control based on average temperature has gained acceptance by major ST manufacturers and demonstrated initial potential to diminish thermal discomfort. This paper empirically characterizes temperature discrepancies in SZMRHs and studies their effects, particularly with respect to thermal comfort and demand response (DR). Our aim is to leverage room-level data sourced from 1000 houses across the United States and two real-world testbeds to identify the shortcomings of SZMRHs and to diagnose the deficiencies via parameter identification. We discover that comfortable DR durations (CDRDs) for rooms are typically 70% longer or 40% shorter than for the room with the thermostat. When averaging, rooms at the control temperature’s bounds are typically deviated around -3°F to 2.5°F from the average. Moreover, in 95% of houses, we identified one or two rooms experiencing notably higher solar gains compared to the rest of the rooms, while 85% and 70% of houses demonstrated lower heat input and poor insulation, respectively. This study serves as a benchmark for assessing thermal comfort and DR services in the existing housing stock, while also highlighting room-level retrofitting needs. Our approach sets the stage for more granular, precise control strategies of SZMRHs.},

abstract = {Contactless RF-based sensing techniques are emerging as a viable means for building gesture recognition systems. While promising, existing RF-based gesture solutions have poor generalization ability when targeting new users, environments or device deployment. They also often require multiple pairs of transceivers and a large number of training samples for each target domain. These limitations either lead to poor cross-domain performance or incur a huge labor cost, hindering their practical adoption. This paper introduces Wi-Learner, a novel RF-based sensing solution that relies on just one pair of transceivers but can deliver accurate cross-domain gesture recognition using just one data sample per gesture for a target user, environment or device setup. Wi-Learner achieves this by first capturing the gesture-induced Doppler frequency shift (DFS) from noisy measurements using carefully designed signal processing schemes. It then employs a convolution neural network-based autoencoder to extract the low-dimensional features to be fed into a downstream model for gesture recognition. Wi-Learner introduces a novel meta-learner to "teach" the neural network to learn effectively from a small set of data points, allowing the base model to quickly adapt to a new domain using just one training sample. By so doing, we reduce the overhead of training data collection and allow a sensing system to adapt to the change of the deployed environment. We evaluate Wi-Learner by applying it to gesture recognition using the Widar 3.0 dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate Wi-Learner is highly efficient and has a good generalization ability, by delivering an accuracy of 93.2% and 74.2% - 94.9% for in-domain and cross-domain using just one sample per gesture, respectively.},

However, due to the fact that most wind farms are built in remote areas with backward network infrastructure, the progress of intelligent O&amp;M of wind farms is slow. Based on the current network situation of wind farms and the network requirements of intelligent O&amp;M, this paper proposes a hybrid networking mode of 5G private network and traditional power communication network, and the networking mode integrates 5G on the basis of retaining the original production network of traditional wind farms private network. This networking mode not only ensures the safe access of intelligent inspection equipment and various sensors in the wind farm, but also provides customized network services such as large bandwidth and low latency. In addition, this networking mode combines the data analysis capabilities of the cloud platform to realize the unattended and unattended wind farm O&amp;M mode, effectively reducing the cost of wind farm operation and maintenance and improving the power generation efficiency of the wind farm. Finally, this paper analyzes the risks of this networking mode, and proposes corresponding security strategies for terminal access and end-to-end (E2E) network channels to ensure the communication security of wind farm intelligent O&amp;M scenarios.},

Despite the abundant research devoted to the development of more accurate, flexible and efficient machine learning schemes as well as 3D sensors, security concerns related to these techniques remain largely untouched. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial attack against this combination by showing that deep learning models with popular 3D sensors may misclassify real objects in the physical environment. Comparing to the existing attack algorithms against deep learning models developed for 3D data analysis that only consider digital point cloud data and single deep learning model, our attacks target popular commercial 3D sensors combined with various deep learning schemes in the black-box setting. Experimental results demonstrate that our 3D printed adversarial objects stay effective after scanned by a 3D sensor.},

abstract = {This research aims to revolutionize the remote travel experience by addressing the lack of proactiveness of user often associated with virtual tours and pre-recorded videos. We propose a novel approach that utilizes a remote-controlled boat equipped with a 360-degree camera, stationed at popular coastal tourist destinations. This innovative setup enables users to engage in immersive experiences such as remote sightseeing, racing game simulations, and interactive fish feeding activities. During the development process, we encountered various challenges, including the selection of a suitable omnidirectional camera that balances quality, price, and compatibility with the boat's system. Ensuring low-latency communication between the user's device and the remote-controlled boat was also crucial for a seamless and responsive experience. Additionally, maintainability, battery operating time, and navigating regulatory requirements posed significant hurdles. To overcome these challenges, we implemented creative solutions. We opted for a compact digital camera capable of capturing 360-degree footage using the USB UVC protocol, striking a balance between image quality and affordability. We leveraged WebRTC protocol to achieve low-latency video streaming and control input transmission, minimizing perceptible delays and enhancing the user experience. To validate the effectiveness of our remote ship control system, we conducted an experiment using the Meta Quest 2 head-mounted display (HMD). Participants controlled the remote boat while immersed in the 360-degree video feed, experiencing the coastal environment as if they were physically present. The results confirmed the system's ability to deliver an immersive and engaging remote travel experience. Looking ahead, we aim to address challenges such as reducing boat rocking, enhancing the sense of presence through additional sensory feedback, and implementing collision avoidance and automatic return functions for the boat. By refining and optimizing the system, we strive to offer users a truly transformative remote travel experience that brings them closer to the wonders of coastal destinations worldwide.},

abstract = {Facial expression recognition plays a vital role to enable emotional awareness in multimedia Internet of Things applications. Traditional camera or wearable sensor based approaches may compromise user privacy or cause discomfort. Recent device-free approaches open a promising direction by exploring Wi-Fi or ultrasound signals reflected from facial muscle movements, but limitations exist such as poor performance in presence of body motions and not being able to detect multiple targets. To bridge the gap, we propose mmFER, a novel millimeter wave (mmWave) radar based system that extracts facial muscle movements associated with mmWave signals to recognize facial expressions. We propose a novel dual-locating approach based on MIMO that explores spatial information from raw mmWave signals for face localization in space, eliminating ambient noise. In addition, collecting mmWave training data can be very costly in practice, and insufficient training dataset may lead to low accuracy. To overcome, we design a cross-domain transfer pipeline to enable effective and safe model knowledge transformation from image to mmWave. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that mmFER achieves an accuracy of 80.57% on average within a detection range between 0.3m and 2.5m, and it is robust to various real-world settings.},

abstract = {Low-latency I/O services are essential for latency-sensitive workloads when they co-run with throughput-oriented workloads in cloud data centers. Although advanced SSDs such as Intel Optane SSDs can offer ultra-low latency at the device layer, I/O interference among various workloads through the I/O stack can still significantly enlarge I/O latency. It is still an open problem to best utilize ultra-low latency SSDs in cloud computing environments.In this paper, we analyze the entire I/O stack and reveal that I/O interference is mainly attributed to resource contention in the SSD device, transactions commit in the file system, and costly process scheduling. To address these problems, we propose FastResponse, a holistic approach to use ultra-low latency SSDs for latency-sensitive workloads. First, we propose a new I/O scheduler at the block layer to throttle I/O requests of throughput-oriented workloads, and thus reduce the resource contention in the SSD device. Second, we develop a fine-grained journaling scheme to reduce the latency of transaction at the file system layer. Third, we redesign Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) to promote the priority of latency-sensitive processes. We implement FastResponse in Linux kernel and evaluate it with several mixed workloads. Compared with the vanilla Linux and the state-of-the-art SelectISR, FastResponse can reduce the average response time of latency-sensitive workloads by 18--70% and 10--67%, respectively, and reduce the 99.9th percentile response time by 58--80% and 52--78%, respectively. Meanwhile, the performance degradation for throughput-oriented workloads is less than 6%.},

abstract = {Multi-channel signals captured by spatially separated sensors often contain a high level of data redundancy. A compact signal representation enables more efficient storage and processing, which has been exploited for data compression, noise reduction, and speech and image coding. This article focuses on the compact representation of speech signals acquired by spherical microphone arrays. A polynomial matrix eigenvalue decomposition (PEVD) can spatially decorrelate signals over a range of time lags and is known to achieve optimum multi-channel data compaction. However, the complexity of PEVD algorithms scales at best cubically with the number of channel signals, e.g., the number of microphones comprised in a spherical array used for processing. In contrast, the spherical harmonic transform (SHT) provides a compact spatial representation of the 3-dimensional sound field measured by spherical microphone arrays, referred to as eigenbeam signals, at a cost that rises only quadratically with the number of microphones. Yet, the SHT's spatially orthogonal basis functions cannot completely decorrelate sound field components over a range of time lags. In this work, we propose to exploit the compact representation offered by the SHT to reduce the number of channels used for subsequent PEVD processing. In the proposed framework for signal representation, we show that the diagonality factor improves by up to 7 dB over the microphone signal representation with a significantly lower computation cost. Moreover, when applying this framework to speech enhancement and source separation, the proposed method improves metrics known as short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) and source-to-distortion ratio (SDR) by up to 0.2 and 20 dB, respectively.},

abstract = {IEEE-754 is the de-facto standard for the implementation of floating-point number systems in hardware. With the rise of machine-learning and mixed-precision computation, applications tolerate small inaccuracies in the data by using lower bit-width floating-point values to improve computational speed and memory bandwidth, but still rely on some variant of IEEE-754. Posits have been proposed as a drop-in replacement to the IEEE-754 floating-point standard. Recent work has suggested that posits can offer greater numerical accuracy and reproducibility than IEEE-754-compliant floating point numbers at a comparable architectural cost. There have been several studies which consider the use of posits and other floating-point implementations in hardware and software, but there is limited work examining this new number system from a reliability perspective. In this paper, we evaluate the resiliency of posits to inform hardware design for fault-tolerant systems. Using real-world scientific datasets, we conduct an extensive bit-flip fault injection campaign to explore the tradeoff between accuracy and sensitivity to silent data corruption (SDC) between posits and IEEE-754. Our analysis breaks down the impact of a bit flip on the various fields within both floating-point standards. Results show the presence of the regime reduces the number of bits that cause catastrophic error in posits compared to IEEE floats. This leads to overall less error in upper bit positions of posits, except in certain edge cases. We found flips in the sign bit usually cause more error in posits due to the effect sign has on posit magnitude, unlike in IEEE floats. We also found that unlike in IEEE floats, the posit exponent does not produce significant error due to its small, static two bit size. Finally, error in the posit fraction was found to be similar to that of IEEE floats.},

While promising in many aspects, the limited sensing range and interference issues still exist, hindering the adoption of WiFi sensing in real world. In this paper, inspired by the SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) metric in communication theory, we propose a new metric named SSNR (sensing-signal-to-noise-ratio) to quantify the sensing capability of WiFi systems. We theoretically model the effect of transmitter-receiver distance on sensing coverage. We show that in LoS scenario, the sensing coverage area increases first from a small oval to a maximal one and then decreases. When the transmitter-receiver distance further increases, the coverage area is separated into two ovals located around the two transceivers respectively. We demonstrate that, instead of applying complex signal processing scheme or advanced hardware, by just properly placing the transmitter and receiver, the two well-known issues in WiFi sensing (i.e., small range and severe interference) can be greatly mitigated. Specifically, by properly placing the transmitter and receiver, the coverage of human walking sensing can be expanded by around 200%. By increasing the transmitter-receiver distance, a target's fine-grained respiration can still be accurately sensed with one interferer sitting just 0.5 m away.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have investigated the effectiveness of audio-visual multimodal learning for speech enhancement (AVSE) tasks, seeking a solution that uses visual data as auxiliary and complementary input to reduce the noise of noisy speech signals. Recently, we proposed a lite audio-visual speech enhancement (LAVSE) algorithm for a car-driving scenario. Compared to conventional AVSE systems, LAVSE requires less online computation and to some extent solves the user privacy problem on facial data. In this study, we extend LAVSE to improve its ability to address three practical issues often encountered in implementing AVSE systems, namely, the additional cost of processing visual data, audio-visual asynchronization, and low-quality visual data. The proposed system is termed improved LAVSE (iLAVSE), which uses a convolutional recurrent neural network architecture as the core AVSE model. We evaluate iLAVSE on the Taiwan Mandarin speech with video dataset. Experimental results confirm that compared to conventional AVSE systems, iLAVSE can effectively overcome the aforementioned three practical issues and can improve enhancement performance. The results also confirm that iLAVSE is suitable for real-world scenarios, where high-quality audio-visual sensors may not always be available.},

abstract = {Binary memristive crossbars have gained huge attention as an energy-efficient deep learning hardware accelerator. Nonetheless, they suffer from various noises due to the analog nature of the crossbars. To overcome such limitations, most previous works train weight parameters with noise data obtained from a crossbar. These methods are, however, ineffective because it is difficult to collect noise data in large-volume manufacturing environment where each crossbar has a large device/circuit level variation. Moreover, we argue that there is still room for improvement even though these methods somewhat improve accuracy. This paper explores a new perspective on mitigating crossbar noise in a more generalized way by manipulating input binary bit encoding rather than training the weight of networks with respect to noise data. We first mathematically show that the noise decreases as the number of binary bit encoding pulses increases when representing the same amount of information. In addition, we propose Gradient-based Bit Encoding Optimization (GBO) which optimizes a different number of pulses at each layer, based on our in-depth analysis that each layer has a different level of noise sensitivity. The proposed heterogeneous layer-wise bit encoding scheme achieves high noise robustness with low computational cost. Our experimental results on public benchmark datasets show that GBO improves the classification accuracy by ~ 5 -- 40% in severe noise scenarios.},

abstract = {Soil moisture sensing is one of the most important components in smart agriculture. It plays a critical role in increasing crop yields and reducing water waste. However, existing commercial soil moisture sensors are either expensive or inaccurate, limiting their real-world deployment. In this paper, we utilize wide-area LoRa signals to sense soil moisture without a need of dedicated soil moisture sensors. Different from traditional usage of LoRa in smart agriculture which is only for sensor data transmission, we leverage LoRa signal itself as a powerful sensing tool. The key insight is that the dielectric permittivity of soil which is closely related to soil moisture can be obtained from phase readings of LoRa signals. Therefore, antennas of a LoRa node can be placed in the soil to capture signal phase readings for soil moisture measurements. Though promising, it is non-trivial to extract accurate phase information due to unsynchronization of LoRa transmitter and receiver. In this work, we propose to include a low-cost switch to equip the LoRa node with two antennas to address the issue. We develop a delicate chirp ratio approach to cancel out the phase offset caused by transceiver unsynchronization to extract accurate phase information. The proposed system design has multiple unique advantages including high accuracy, robustness against motion interference and large sensing range for large-scale deployment in smart agriculture. Experiments with commodity LoRa nodes show that our system can accurately estimate soil moisture at an average error of 3.1%, achieving a performance comparable to high-end commodity soil moisture sensors. Field studies show that the proposed system can accurately sense soil moisture even when the LoRa gateway is 100 m away from the LoRa node, enabling wide-area soil moisture sensing for the first time.},

Currently, mainstream electric field meters primarily use rotating shield electrodes as electric field detection probes. These probes detect charges in a spatial electric field through an induction plate. A rotating motor connects the grounded electrode on the induction plate, and the process of exposing, blocking, and shielding the induction electrode changes the induced charge, generating an induced current. However, such electric field meters are bulky and expensive. The aim of this study is to design a miniature membrane-type atmospheric electric field meter with electromagnetic drive using electrostatic induction from conductors. The device consists of a sensing module, a detection module, a wireless transmission module, and a protective casing. Compared to costly MEMS-based models, this technology offers lower costs, better environmental adaptability, and potential for widespread deployment.},

abstract = {Emerging inter-datacenter applications require massive loads of data transfer which makes them sensitive to packet drops, high latency, and fair resource sharing. However, current congestion control (CC) protocols do not guarantee the optimal outcome of these metrics. In this paper, we introduce a new CC technique, Machine Learning Aided Congestion Control (MLACC), that combines heuristics and machine learning (ML) to improve these three network metrics. The proposed technique achieves a high level of fairness, minimum latency, and minimum drop rate. ML is utilized to estimate the ratio of the available bandwidth of the bottleneck link while the heuristic uses this ratio to enable end-points to cooperatively limit the shared bottleneck link utilization under a predefined threshold in order to minimize latency and drop rate. The key to achieving the desired fairness is using the gradient of the link utilization to control the sending rate. We compared MLACC to BBR (which is at least on par with the state-of-the-art ML-based techniques) as a base case in different network settings. The results show that MLACC can achieve lower and more stable end-to-end latency (25% to 52% latency saving). It also significantly reduces packet drop rates while attaining a higher fairness level. The only cost for these advantages is a small throughput reduction of less than 3.5%.},

abstract = {Computational drug repositioning aims to discover new therapeutic diseases for marketed drugs and has the advantages of low cost, short development cycle, and high controllability compared to traditional drug development. The matrix factorization model has become the cornerstone technique for computational drug repositioning due to its ease of implementation and excellent scalability. However, the matrix factorization model uses the inner product operation to represent the association between drugs and diseases, which is lacking in expressive ability. Moreover, the degree of similarity of drugs or diseases could not be implied on their respective latent factor vectors, which is not satisfy the common sense of drug discovery. Therefore, a neural metric factorization model for computational drug repositioning (NMFDR) is proposed in this work. We novelly consider the latent factor vector of drugs and diseases as a point in the high-dimensional coordinate system and propose a generalized euclidean distance to represent the association between drugs and diseases to compensate for the shortcomings of the inner product operation. Furthermore, by embedding multiple drug (disease) metrics information into the encoding space of the latent factor vector, the information about the similarity between drugs (diseases) can be reflected in the distance between latent factor vectors. Finally, we conduct wide analysis experiments on three real datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the above improvement points and the superiority of the NMFDR model.},

abstract = {Resource-constrained Edge Devices (EDs), e.g., IoT sensors and microcontroller units, are expected to make intelligent decisions using Deep Learning (DL) inference at the edge of the network. Toward this end, developing tinyML models is an area of active research - DL models with reduced computation and memory storage requirements - that can be embedded on these devices. However, tinyML models have lower inference accuracy. On a different front, DNN partitioning and inference offloading techniques were studied for distributed DL inference between EDs and Edge Servers (ESs). In this paper, we explore Hierarchical Inference (HI), a novel approach proposed in [19] for performing distributed DL inference at the edge. Under HI, for each data sample, an ED first uses a local algorithm (e.g., a tinyML model) for inference. Depending on the application, if the inference provided by the local algorithm is incorrect or further assistance is required from large DL models on edge or cloud, only then the ED offloads the data sample. At the outset, HI seems infeasible as the ED, in general, cannot know if the local inference is sufficient or not. Nevertheless, we present the feasibility of implementing HI for image classification applications. We demonstrate its benefits using quantitative analysis and show that HI provides a better trade-off between offloading cost, throughput, and inference accuracy compared to alternate approaches.},

abstract = {Eye tracking has become an essential human-machine interaction modality for providing immersive experience in numerous virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) applications desiring high throughput (e.g., 240 FPS), small-form, and enhanced visual privacy. However, existing eye tracking systems are still limited by their: (1) large form-factor largely due to the adopted bulky lens-based cameras; (2) high communication cost required between the camera and backend processor; and (3) potentially concerned low visual privacy, thus prohibiting their more extensive applications. To this end, we propose, develop, and validate a lensless FlatCambased eye tracking algorithm and accelerator co-design framework dubbed EyeCoD to enable eye tracking systems with a much reduced form-factor and boosted system efficiency without sacrificing the tracking accuracy, paving the way for next-generation eye tracking solutions. On the system level, we advocate the use of lensless FlatCams instead of lens-based cameras to facilitate the small form-factor need in mobile eye tracking systems, which also leaves rooms for a dedicated sensing-processor co-design to reduce the required camera-processor communication latency. On the algorithm level, EyeCoD integrates a predict-then-focus pipeline that first predicts the region-of-interest (ROI) via segmentation and then only focuses on the ROI parts to estimate gaze directions, greatly reducing redundant computations and data movements. On the hardware level, we further develop a dedicated accelerator that (1) integrates a novel workload orchestration between the aforementioned segmentation and gaze estimation models, (2) leverages intra-channel reuse opportunities for depth-wise layers, (3) utilizes input feature-wise partition to save activation memory size, and (4) develops a sequential-write-parallel-read input buffer to alleviate the bandwidth requirement for the activation global buffer. On-silicon measurement and extensive experiments validate that our EyeCoD consistently reduces both the communication and computation costs, leading to an overall system speedup of 10.95\texttimes{}, 3.21\texttimes{}, and 12.85\texttimes{} over general computing platforms including CPUs and GPUs, and a prior-art eye tracking processor called CIS-GEP, respectively, while maintaining the tracking accuracy.

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that is considered a major public health problem worldwide. The current diagnostic technology for TB detection is not efficient. Interferon-γ inducible protein 10 (IP-10) is a highly investigated biomarker for TB diagnosis. Nanobody (Nb) is a novel type of antibody fragment which can be produced in microorganisms at a low cost and could be used to replace mAb in diagnostics. This study focused on selection of a nanobody specific to IP-10. Phage display was used for the initial screening anti-IP-10 Nb from a synthetic library. Functional Ligand-binding Identification by Tat-based Recognition of Associating Proteins (FLI-TRAP) technique was then used for Nb isolation from the 1st round of phage biopanning. After FLI-TRAP selection, 11 out of 20 (55%) randomly samples showed CB resistance at a single colony level representing potential anti-IP-10 Nbs. These candidates were sequence verified and 5 out of 11 (45%) showed no stop codon within the Nb genes. With the new proposed method for verification of cell resistance due to Tat transport of Nb-IP-10 complex proposed in this study, it may be possible to obtain 100% true positive identification. Successful identification of one anti-IP-10 Nb from this large size of a synthetic Nb is the first step. In the future, we could generate mutated library of this full-length Nb and use FLI-TRAP to identify other enhanced variants, which maybe suitable to be used in the development of a TB diagnostic kit that is more affordable, easy to store, and has a higher sensitivity and specificity.},

In addition, the autonomous operations of UAVs reduce risks by minimizing the time spent by human workers in harsh environments and lowering costs by automating tasks. For reliability and safety, the drones must sense and avoid potential obstacles and must be capable of safely navigating in unknown environments. UAVs’ perception requires reliability in various settings, such as high dust levels, humidity, intense sun glare, dark, and fog that can severely obstruct many conventional sensing methods. Radar systems have unique strengths; they can reliably estimate how far an object is and measure its relative speed via the Doppler effect. In addition, because radars exploit radio waves to sense, they perform well in rain, fog, snow, or smoky environments. This stands in contrast to optical technologies, such as cameras or LIght Detection And Ranging (Lidars), which are more susceptible to the same challenges as the human eye. This survey paper aims to address the signal processing challenges for the exploitation of radar systems in unmanned aerial vehicles for advanced perception, considering recent integration trends and technology capabilities. The focus is on signal processing techniques for low-cost and power-efficient radar sensors, which operate onboard the UAVs in real-time to ensure their needs in terms of perception, situational awareness, and navigation. Additionally, we highlight the challenges that remain to be tackled and the opportunities that lie ahead in the search for a more efficient, safe, and autonomous way for UAVs to perceive and interact with the world.},

abstract = {Tensors, which provide a powerful and flexible model for representing multi-attribute data and multi-way interactions, play an indispensable role in modern data science across various fields in science and engineering. A fundamental task is to faithfully recover the tensor from highly incomplete measurements in a statistically and computationally efficient manner. Harnessing the low-rank structure of tensors in the Tucker decomposition, this paper develops a scaled gradient descent (ScaledGD) algorithm to directly recover the tensor factors with tailored spectral initializations, and shows that it provably converges at a linear rate independent of the condition number of the ground truth tensor for two canonical problems -- tensor completion and tensor regression -- as soon as the sample size is above the order of n3/2 ignoring other parameter dependencies, where n is the dimension of the tensor. This leads to an extremely scalable approach to low-rank tensor estimation compared with prior art, which suffers from at least one of the following drawbacks: extreme sensitivity to ill-conditioning, high per-iteration costs in terms of memory and computation, or poor sample complexity guarantees. To the best of our knowledge, ScaledGD is the first algorithm that achieves near-optimal statistical and computational complexities simultaneously for low-rank tensor completion with the Tucker decomposition. Our algorithm highlights the power of appropriate preconditioning in accelerating nonconvex statistical estimation, where the iteration-varying preconditioners promote desirable invariance properties of the trajectory with respect to the underlying symmetry in low-rank tensor factorization.},

abstract = {Maximal Independent Set (MIS) is one of the fundamental and most well-studied problems in distributed graph algorithms. Even after four decades of intensive research, the best known (randomized) MIS algorithms have O(log n) round complexity on general graphs [Luby, STOC 1986] (where n is the number of nodes), while the best known lower bound is [EQUATION] [Kuhn, Moscibroda, Wattenhofer, JACM 2016]. Breaking past the O(log n) round complexity upper bound or showing stronger lower bounds have been longstanding open problems.Energy is a premium resource in various settings such as battery-powered wireless networks and sensor networks. The bulk of the energy is used by nodes when they are awake, i.e., when they are sending, receiving, and even just listening for messages. On the other hand, when a node is sleeping, it does not perform any communication and thus spends very little energy. Several recent works have addressed the problem of designing energy-efficient distributed algorithms for various fundamental problems. These algorithms operate by minimizing the number of rounds in which any node is awake, also called the (worst-case) awake complexity. An intriguing open question is whether one can design a distributed MIS algorithm that has significantly smaller awake complexity compared to existing algorithms. In particular, the question of obtaining a distributed MIS algorithm with o(log n) awake complexity was left open in [Chatterjee, Gmyr, Pandurangan, PODC 2020].Our main contribution is to show that MIS can be computed in awake complexity that is exponentially better compared to the best known round complexity of O(log n) and also bypassing its fundamental [EQUATION] round complexity lower bound exponentially. Specifically, we show that MIS can be computed by a randomized distributed (Monte Carlo) algorithm in O(log log n) awake complexity with high probability.1 However, this algorithm has a round complexity that is O(poly(n)). We then show how to drastically improve the round complexity at the cost of a slight increase in awake complexity by presenting a randomized distributed (Monte Carlo) algorithm for MIS that, with high probability computes an MIS in O((log log n) log* n) awake complexity and O((log3 n)(log log n) log* n) round complexity. Our algorithms work in the CONGEST model where messages of size O(log n) bits can be sent per edge per round.},

abstract = {This paper studies the application of XGBoost model in the stock market. The main content is to analyze its prediction of stock returns and measure the importance of features. This paper uses the A-share data from 2001 to 2022 and constructs an XGBoost model with multiple prediction features. It is found that this model is significantly better than the traditional OLS model in predicting the excess return of stocks. For the test period from 2014 to 2022, the XGBoost strategy can achieve 155% higher returns and risk-adjusted performance than the OLS strategy in the portfolio based on the model forecast, and XGBoost has higher average monthly returns in both long and long-short strategies, and has more advantages in risk control. In particular, the maximum retracement in long-short strategies is low. Based on the feature importance analysis, it is concluded that corporate profitability indicators and medium-term momentum play the most important role in predicting the return characteristics of Chinese stocks, and technical indicators and market microstructure factors also show relatively high predictive information, potentially reflecting the unique attributes of China's A-share stock market. The research results of this paper can understand the pricing mechanism of China's stock market to a certain extent, and play an important practical role in guiding the design of quantitative investment strategies and asset management practices. The research results show the sensitivity of nonlinear models to complex market dynamics and point out broad market prospects for further in-depth research on the application potential of machine learning in financial markets.},

abstract = {An immense volume of data is produced by sensor devices in the fields of aquaponics, hydroponics, and soil-based food production, where these devices track various environmental factors. Data stream mining is the method of retrieving data from fast-sampled data sources that are constantly streaming. The accuracy of data obtained through data stream mining is largely determined by the algorithm utilized to filter out noise. For threshold-based automation, an actuator can be activated when the value of sensor data is above a permissible threshold. Noise from sensors may activate the actuator. Several statistical and machine learning-based noise-suppression algorithms have been proposed in the literature. They have been evaluated based on the mean squared error metric (MSE). The Long Short-Term Memory – LSTM filter (MSE: 0.000999943) performs better noise suppression than other traditional filters – Kalman (MSE: 0.0015982). We propose a new noise suppression filter – LSTM combined with Kalman (LSTM-KF). In LSTM-KF, the Kalman filter acts as an encoder and the LSTM becomes the decoder, resulting in a significantly lower MSE – 0.000080789592. The LSTM-KF is installed in our threshold-based aquaponics automation to maximize sustainable food production at minimum cost.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), massive IIoT devices connect to industrial networks via wired and wireless. Furthermore, industrial networks pose new requirements on communications, such as strict latency boundaries, ultra-reliable transmission, and so on. To this end, time-sensitive networking (TSN) embedded fifth-generation (5G) wireless communication technology (i.e., TSN-5G networks), is considered the most promising solution to address these challenges. TSN can provide deterministic end-to-end latency and reliability for real-time applications in wired networks. 5G supports ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (uRLLC), providing increased flexibility and inherent mobility support in the wireless network. Thus, the integration of TSN and 5G provides numerous benefits, including increased flexibility, lower commissioning costs, and seamless interoperability of various devices, regardless of whether they use a wired or wireless interface. Nonetheless, the potential barriers between the TSN and 5G systems, such as clock synchronization and end-to-end traffic scheduling, are inevitable. Time synchronization has been studied in many works, so this paper focuses on the end-to-end traffic scheduling problem in TSN-5G networks. We propose a novel integrated TSN and 5G industrial network architecture, where the 5G system acts as a logical TSN-capable bridge. Based on this network architecture, we design a Double Q-learning based hierarchical particle swarm optimization algorithm (DQHPSO) to search for the optimal scheduling solution. The DQHPSO algorithm adopts a level-based population structure and introduces Double Q-learning to adjust the number of levels in the population, which evades the local optimum to further improve the search efficiency. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the DQHPSO algorithm can increase the scheduling success ratio of time-triggered flows compared to other algorithms.},

abstract = {Cold-start times have been the "end-all, be-all" metric for research in serverless cloud computing over the past decade. Reducing the impact of cold starts matters, because they can be the biggest contributor to a serverless function's end-to-end execution time. Recent studies from cloud providers, however, indicate that, in practice, a majority of serverless functions are triggered by non-interactive workloads. To substantiate this, we study the types of serverless functions used in 35 publications and find that over 80% of functions are not semantically latency sensitive. If a function is non-interactive and latency insensitive, is end-to-end execution time the right metric to optimize in serverless? What if cold starts do not matter that much, after all?In this vision paper, we explore what serverless environments in which cold starts do not matter would look like. We make the case that serverless research should focus on supporting latency insensitive, i.e., batch, workloads. Based on this, we explore the design space for DFaaS, a serverless framework with an execution model in which functions can be arbitrarily delayed. DFaaS users annotate each function with a delay tolerance and, as long as the deadline has not passed, the runtime may interrupt or migrate function execution. Our micro-benchmarks suggest that, by targeting batch workloads, DFaaS can improve substantially the resource usage of serverless clouds and lower costs for users.},

abstract = {Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease with high mortality and disability. Computer-aided interventional diagnosis is a necessary measure to improve the efficiency of stroke diagnosis by using modern advanced medical instruments and machine learning methods. Electroencephalogram (EEG) as a diagnostic means, is a test that measures the electrical activity of the brain through electrodes attached to the scalp to find changes in brain activity. EEG detection has the advantages of low cost, simple and easy to implement, and no physical harm and psychological stress to patients. Studies&nbsp;have&nbsp;shown that EEG signal might be useful in diagnosing stroke. By using machine learning methods, EEG signals can be used to classify stroke patients and normal subjects, or subtypes. Stroke is generally divided into two types: ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. How to classify ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes based on stroke patients’ EEG data by constructing prediction model is the main purpose on this paper. In recent years, researchers have developed many technologies in the field of stroke classification prediction based on EEG signals, using a variety of machine learning methods to ensure the improvement of prediction accuracy. The typical methods usually extract the time domain, frequency domain or spatial domain features of EEG signals before establishing a stroke classification model. However, the quality of the extracted features cannot be guaranteed in stroke patient or subtype classification. In addition, EEG feature extraction is usually computationally expensive. The main goal of this paper is to propose a novel classification prediction model using an end-to-end deep neural network that avoids the process of manual feature extraction. This paper proposes a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) classification model based on stroke EEG signal. The model includes four convolutional blocks, a global average pooling layer, a dropout layer, and a SoftMax layer. Each convolution block consists of two convolution layers and a pool layer for extracting features and reducing the number of parameters. A one-dimensional convolution kernel is used in order to match the characteristics of EEG one-dimensional time domain signal. The model can automatically extract the features of stroke EEG signal for classifying stroke by using convolutional layers. The EEG data of clinical stroke patients collected from the neurology department of a hospital are used in the experiments. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is also used as a benchmark to achieve end-to-end prediction for verifying the proposed model performance. The experimental results show that the proposed 1D-CNN prediction model has good prediction performance, with an accuracy of 90.53%, a precision of 87.90%, a sensitivity of 91.60%, and a specificity of 89.65%. It is much higher than the prediction result of LSTM model.},

We integrate complex DP mechanisms with our structured cache, through novel cache-aware DP cost optimization.

Any data alternation while transmitting through the transmission channel may cause security issues like data integrity. Data integrity is essential because any alteration of data can hamper medical diagnoses by losing sensitive data. Watermarking could be a practical approach for ensuring such data security with a lower computational cost. Various strategies of watermarking were used to secure health data, especially images. However, watermarking for patient text data has been difficult due to the availability of the right techniques. Therefore, this paper introduces a new watermarking strategy to share patient text from distributed databases. We use the prescription data for testing the proposed system.

Prior to the work described in this paper, Network Simulator 3 had no support for the Sigfox protocol, and this paper presents a module to simulate the Sigfox protocol. The module is parametric with respect to the energy consumed by devices in different states, and we present simulation results obtained by calibrating the model using measurements obtained from a real Sigfox hardware module. Moreover, this work models a battery that is affected by self-discharge current. By means of this ns-3 module, it is possible to simulate a scenario prior to its deployment, thus helping with planning the deployment itself. To showcase the benefits of our work, we designed a behavioral model of devices using different communication strategies, and we present results on how long a device lasts and how much data delivery costs for different strategies.

abstract = {While acoustic-based underwater communication systems have been widely used for many decades, existing systems still suffer from the low reliability problem due to the severe multipath fading, especially in shallow water environments. It is well known that MIMO and beamforming techniques are among the most effective solutions to address fading challenges. However, not all underwater devices can carry the multiple-transducer system due to cost and size limitations, especially small AUVs and sensors. In this paper, we design and characterize the novel acoustic intelligent surfaces in the underwater environment, which enables the beamforming capability to address the multipath fading problem, without requiring the end-users to equip MIMO components. To the best of our knowledge, although electromagnetic (EM) intelligent surfaces have been intensively investigated for terrestrial communications recently, acoustic intelligent surface has not been explored since it has completely different physical mechanism and hardware structure than that of EM surfaces. Therefore, in this paper, we design a new reconfigurable piezoelectric reflector array that performs as an underwater intelligent surface. Rigorous analytical model is developed to characterize how the designed underwater intelligent surface controls the propagation of acoustic waves in the underwater multipath channel. Based on the new design and model, the underwater intelligent surface-enabled beamforming protocol is provided. Through a hybrid underwater communication simulator based on COMSOL Multiphysics and Bellhop toolbox, we demonstrate the proposed acoustic intelligent surface can effectively form and steer acoustic beams and significantly mitigate the multipath fading in shallow underwater environments.},

Vehicle-to-Grid(V2G) is a technology for electric vehicles to interact with the power grid as energy storage units. However, when electric vehicles are connected to the power grid, the V2G network will involve a large amount of privacy data exchange and sensitive charging/discharging transactions, directly threatening user privacy and security. For this reason, many scholars have focused on anonymous protocols. However, existing anonymous authentication protocols in V2G networks rely on a completely trusted third party. Once a third-party center is attacked, user data security and privacy security will no longer exist. Therefore, based on distributed key technology, we propose a decentralized anonymous authentication protocol with conditional privacy preservation. At the same time, a batch verification algorithm suitable for this protocol was proposed, further improving the authentication efficiency of local aggregators. Finally, security analysis and experimental analysis were conducted on the proposed protocol. The results indicate that our protocol has formal provable security and has lower computational and communication costs compared to existing protocols.},

abstract = {Devices with limited computing resources use smaller AI models to achieve low-latency inferencing. However, model accuracy is typically much lower than the accuracy of a bigger model that is trained and deployed in places where the computing resources are relatively abundant. We describe DyCo, a novel system that ensures privacy of stream data and dynamically improves the accuracy of small models used in devices. Unlike knowledge distillation or federated learning, DyCo treats AI models as black boxes. DyCo uses a semi-supervised approach to leverage existing training frameworks and network model architectures to periodically train contextualized, smaller models for resource-constrained devices. DyCo uses a bigger, highly accurate model in the edge-cloud to auto-label data received from each sensor stream. Training in the edge-cloud (as opposed to the public cloud) ensures data privacy, and bespoke models for thousands of live data streams can be designed in parallel by using multiple edge-clouds. DyCo uses the auto-labeled data to periodically re-train, stream-specific, bespoke small models. To reduce the periodic training costs, DyCo uses different policies that are based on stride, accuracy, and confidence information.We evaluate our system, and the contextualized models, by using two object detection models for vehicles and people, and two datasets (a public benchmark and another real-world proprietary dataset). Our results show that DyCo increases the mAP accuracy measure of small models by an average of 16.3% (and up to 20%) for the public benchmark and an average of 19.0% (and up to 64.9%) for the real-world dataset. DyCo also decreases the training costs for contextualized models by more than an order of magnitude.},

abstract = {Electric tricycles, or "e-trikes," are becoming increasingly common in the Philippines as a result of rising demand for reasonably priced and environmentally responsible transportation options. However, there are worries about road safety and regulatory compliance due to the increase in e-trike sightings on major roads, many of which are operated without the required training or licenses. To&nbsp;overcome these difficulties, this work suggests a machine learning model for precise e-trike detection on national highways that is based on YOLOv7. Results show that the YOLOv7 model has limits in the absence of LLI augmentation, especially when it comes to decreasing false positives and raising sensitivity. Still, the model performs remarkably well when combined with LLI upgrades, achieving 94.68% accuracy, improved precision (98.28%), higher recall (96.28%), and an astounding F1 score of 97.27%. The finding that LLI modifications considerably improve the model's ability to reliably recognize and capture e-trikes, even in difficult low-light circumstances, is supported by the quantitative data. These results underline the importance of YOLOv7 and LLI enhancements in enhancing object recognition accuracy in transportation scenarios. With the proposed pre-processing technique for LLI, the proposed Yolov7 model can be utilized in detecting e-trikes in road scenes.},

abstract = {The continuous development of high-resolution imagery satellite payloads is featured with lower cost, high-integration and smaller volume, which promotes the wide adoption of Earth-imaging facilities on satellite in order to improve sensing coverage, quality, efficiency and so on. Satellite task planning is crucial in automatically generating observation timelines to fulfill the Earth-imaging tasks by optimizing the usage of satellite resources. As an important category of ground sensing tasks, points of interest(PoIs) are very common for satellite to sense ground changes such as building collapse in earthquake, social hot spots, volcano eruption, etc. As the number of PoIs increases enormously, separately planning for each PoI sensing task is no more realistic and aggregating the dense ground points for collaboratively imaging them through multi-satellite can provide a new solution for constellation applications. In this paper, a novel ground PoIs aggregation method is proposed to decrease task manipulation frequencies of satellites, based on which a collaborative multi-satellite planning is modeled and solved by particle swarm optimization. The efficacy of the aggregation-collaboration manner is evaluated and demonstrated in the experiment.},

abstract = {In the task allocation of mobile crowdsensing (MCS), importance is often attached to the quality of sensing data while the data timeliness is often neglected, which may lead to the slow response of the MCS platform for urgent tasks (such as fire, geological disasters, etc.), thus missing the golden response time. Based on the definition of worker data timeliness and area coverage, a coverage-aware task allocation algorithm (CATA) is proposed in the paper. The CATA algorithm adopts fog nodes as the intermediate layer between MCS platform and participants and tries to both maximize the data timeliness and minimizing the incentive cost. For tasks with given location and crowdsensing range, workers with higher data timeliness and lower bidding are selected from participants according to their data timeliness and virtual credit. In addition, the location privacy of participants is protected by geo-indistinguishability. Results of simulation experiment validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of sensor networks in urban areas, vast amounts of data from location-based social network platforms are now available, thus enabling the stakeholders to develop location-aware services for the end users. PoI (Point of Interests) recommendation is one of the most trending services. PoI recommendation models are developed by considering geographical information and historical records. More recently, with the demand for achieving PoI recommendations on mobile devices, embedded devices, or Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the challenges posed by the limited computational resources, malicious clients, and data silos, the model performance gets immensely affected. To address the above challenges and achieve efficient PoI recommendations, we propose an efficient federated graph learning-based model for mining complex spatiotemporal features to generate recommendations. We implement a GRU-based encoder-decoder to learn the temporal hidden state embeddings. Simultaneously, a 2-layer graph network is used to understand spatial embedding vectors. We also introduce an efficient contribution evaluation method to speed up the training process and improve the recommendation performance. Experiments on the PoI recommendation task based on real-life check-in data validate the effectiveness of our proposed model, and the results indicate that our recommendation model can achieve competitive results with lower computational costs.},

abstract = {Voice user interfaces (VUIs) have been adopted in many IoT and mobile devices in daily life. VUIs provide a good user experience with lower-cost hardware (i.e., microphone) and higher throughput (compared with keyboard and touchscreen). Currently, identity authentication and receiving commands are the two most common interactions through VUIs, leaving physiological information in the voice unexploited. Recognizing this untapped potential, we propose VocalHR to extend VUIs beyond voice commands to heart activity sensing without additional hardware. VocalHR is built upon the voice-heart modulation effect, which is rooted in the cardiac activities' impacts on the behavior of the vocal organ during voice production. VocalHR captures voice features of cardiac activity in multiple voice organs and proposes a deep learning pipeline to transform features into cardiac activities. As this is the first study exploring voice-based heart activity sensing, we conducted extensive experiments on 43 demographically diverse subjects to verify the intrinsic link between voice and heart activities. On average, VocalHR can achieve less than 11.1% normalized sensing error on the heart event timing. Our further evaluation shows VocalHR is robust to different microphone specifications and varying speech rates.},

abstract = {Catheter-Based Coronary Angiography (CCA) and computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) are both used in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). The current study aims to evaluate the accuracy of CTCA compared to CCA as a gold standard to find an alternative method to CCA in diagnosing CAD. 65 patients with suspected coronary heart disease underwent CCA and CTCA procedures using 128-section computed tomography (MDCT). The CT images were analyzed by three consultant radiologists with more than 10 years of experience. CCA and CTCA reports were compared, and sensitivity, specificity, positive expected value (PPV) and negative expected value (NPV) were analyzed. These values were found for the 'per artery' and 'per patient' criteria. The results showed that the sensitivity, specificity of PPV, and NPV for accuracy measures of 'per patient' analyzes were 96.8%, 97%, 96.8%, and 97%, respectively. For left main coronary artery (LM), left anterior Descending (LAD), Circumflex artery (CX), and Right Coronary Artery (RCA), the results were 100%, 98.40%, 75%, 100%, 90.6%, 97%, 96.6 %, 91.4% and 61.1%, 100%, 100%, 87% and 73.70%, 97.8%, 93.3%, 90%, respectively with p&lt;.001. The study concluded that it is possible to use MDCT as an alternative part of CCA, which can be used to reduce CCA pain, procedure time, and at a lower cost.},

Secondly, to improve the stability and accuracy of the trajectory tracking of the foot, a nonlinear integral sliding mode controller based on the adaptive fast power reaching law is designed in combination with the asymptotic saturation function.

abstract = {The biosignals consist of several sensors that collect time series information. Since time series contain temporal dependencies, they are difficult to process by existing machine learning algorithms. Hyper-Dimensional Computing (HDC) is introduced as a brain-inspired paradigm for lightweight time series classification. However, there are the following drawbacks with existing HDC algorithms: (1) low classification accuracy that comes from linear hyperdimensional representation, (2) lack of real-time learning support due to costly and non-hardware friendly operations, and (3) unable to build up a strong model from partially labeled data.In this paper, we propose TempHD, a novel hyperdimensional computing method for efficient and accurate biosignal classification. We first develop a novel non-linear hyperdimensional encoding that maps data points into high-dimensional space. Unlike existing HDC solutions that use costly mathematics for encoding, TempHD preserves spatial-temporal information of data in original space before mapping data into high-dimensional space. To obtain the most informative representation, our encoding method considers the non-linear interactions between both spatial sensors and temporally sampled data. Our evaluation shows that TempHD provides higher classification accuracy, significantly higher computation efficiency, and, more importantly, the capability to learn from partially labeled data. We evaluate TempHD effectiveness on noisy EEG data used for a brain-machine interface. Our results show that TempHD achieves, on average, 2.3% higher classification accuracy as well as 7.7\texttimes{} and 21.8\texttimes{} speedup for training and testing time compared to state-of-the-art HDC algorithms, respectively.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the issue of energy imbalance in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for power grids by proposing an energy-balanced flow scheduling strategy for multi-hop data transmission. In WSNs, flow scheduling strategies determine the transmission paths of data packets within the network, playing a decisive role in network stability and longevity. The proposed strategy aims to balance energy consumption among nodes during multi-hop data transmission through route selection and load balancing. The routing mechanism can monitor and evaluate multiple metrics of nodes in real-time, such as energy levels and communication load, prioritizing nodes with high energy efficiency and stability as the next hop to optimize overall network performance and transmission efficiency. Additionally, the application of load balancing technology prevents certain nodes from depleting their energy too quickly due to overuse, thereby extending the network's lifespan and reducing maintenance costs. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy achieves lower maximum link energy consumption and shorter run time. This flow scheduling strategy effectively improves energy distribution and operational speed in WSNs, which is crucial for ensuring the long-term stable operation of the power grid.},

abstract = {Edge detection is a widely used low-level operation done in computer vision applications and image processing tasks. The primary purpose of edge detection is to discover and distinguish sharp discontinuities from an image. Since edges give boundaries between different regions in the image, these boundaries can be used to classify objects for segmentation and matching purposes. This is the first step in many computer vision applications. Edge detection remarkably reduces the amount of data and filters out undesired or less significant information and gives useful information in an image. There are some widely used algorithms for edge detection, some of which perform better than others but might require higher computational power. But all of them face several difficulties like false edge detection, issues due to noise, and missing of low contrast boundaries. Such difficulties are handled with other algorithms, if the data set has few images. But when the data set is enormous, removing noises and detecting edges simultaneously is very costly. So, a general idea regarding how noise resistant different edge detection algorithms are is necessary. In this paper, we have compared the performances of the most common edge detection methods on a publicly available dataset, provided experimental results on how sensitive each of them is to different kinds of added noises to the original images, and finally come to a conclusion on which one of them is most resistant to noises.},

abstract = {An emerging use case of machine learning (ML) is to train a model on a high-performance system and deploy the trained model on energy-constrained embedded systems. Neuromorphic hardware platforms, which operate on principles of the biological brain, can significantly lower the energy overhead of an ML inference task, making these platforms an attractive solution for embedded ML systems. We present a design-technology tradeoff analysis to implement such inference tasks on the processing elements (PEs) of a non-volatile memory (NVM)-based neuromorphic hardware. Through detailed circuit-level simulations at scaled process technology nodes, we show the negative impact of technology scaling on the information-processing latency, which impacts the quality of service of an embedded ML system. At a finer granularity, the latency inside a PE depends on (1) the delay introduced by parasitic components on its current paths, and (2) the varying delay to sense different resistance states of its NVM cells. Based on these two observations, we make the following three contributions. First, on the technology front, we propose an optimization scheme where the NVM resistance state that takes the longest time to sense is set on current paths having the least delay, and vice versa, reducing the average PE latency, which improves the quality of service. Second, on the architecture front, we introduce isolation transistors within each PE to partition it into regions that can be individually power-gated, reducing both latency and energy. Finally, on the system-software front, we propose a mechanism to leverage the proposed technological and architectural enhancements when implementing an ML inference task on neuromorphic PEs of the hardware. Evaluations with a recent neuromorphic hardware architecture show that our proposed design-technology co-optimization approach improves both performance and energy efficiency of ML inference tasks without incurring high cost-per-bit.},

abstract = {We carry out the first in-depth characterization of residential proxies (RESIPs) in China, for which little is studied in previous works. Our study is made possible through a semantic-based classifier to automatically capture RESIP services. In addition to the classifier, new techniques have also been identified to capture RESIPs without interacting with and relaying traffic through RESIP services, which can significantly lower the cost and thus allow continuous monitoring of RESIPs. Our RESIP service classifier has achieved good performance with a recall of 99.7% and a precision of 97.6% in 10-fold cross validation. Applying the classifier has identified 399 RESIP services, a much larger set compared to 38 RESIP services collected in all previous works. Our effort of RESIP capturing leads to a collection of 9,077,278 RESIP IPs (51.36% are located in China), 96.70% of which are not covered in publicly available RESIP datasets. An extensive measurement on RESIPs and their services has uncovered a set of interesting findings as well as several security implications. Especially, 80.05% RESIP IPs located in China have sourced at least one malicious traffic flows during 2021, resulting in 52-million malicious traffic flows in total. And RESIPs have also been observed in corporation networks of 559 sensitive organizations including government agencies, education institutions and enterprises. Also, 3,232,698 China RESIP IPs have opened at least one TCP/UDP port for accepting relaying requests, which incurs non-negligible security risks to the local network of RESIPs. Besides, 91% China RESIP IPs are of a lifetime fewer than 10 days while most China RESIP services show up a crest-trough pattern in terms of the daily active RESIPs across time.},

abstract = {In Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSN), wireless energy transfer procedures are provided to recharge sensor batteries using chargers. WRSN provide energy replacement and prolong network lifetime to the sensors. Most of the earlier work focussed on sensor node’s sensing task instead of charging utilities. So, an efficient partitioning approach is required to lower the cost of network deployment, to reduce the energy consumption rate and to increase the lifespan of network. Initially, to reduce the energy consumption rate, deadline and penalty values of nodes are computed. Then, considering the criticality of sensor nodes accurate number of multiple mobile chargers are deployed in the network in such a way that the network is partitioned into several number of subregions. Then, use of on-demand recharging and multi-node recharging, is the most efficient way of charging numerous sensor nodes at a time which results in the increases in the lifespan of network. Finally, using Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) approach the scheduling of sensor node is achieved. The usefulness of our scheme is then demonstrated through comprehensive simulations. The results show that the proposed technique reduces charging latency by 23.52 percent, increases network lifetime by 72.35 percent and charging efficiency is increased by 80.90 percent.},

abstract = {Edge computing is a growing paradigm where compute resources are provisioned between data sources and the cloud to decrease compute latency from data transfer, lower costs, comply with security policies, and more. Edge systems are as varied as their applications, serving internet services, IoT, and emerging technologies. Due to the tight constraints experienced by many edge systems, research computing testbeds have become valuable tools for edge research and application benchmarking. Current testbed infrastructure, however, fails to properly emulate many important edge contexts leading to inaccurate benchmarking. Institutions with broad interests in edge computing can build testbeds, but prior work suggests that edge testbeds are often application or sensor specific. A general edge testbed should include access to many of the sensors, software, and accelerators on which edge systems rely, while slicing those resources to fit user-defined resource footprints. PROWESS is an edge testbed that answers this challenge. PROWESS provides access across an institution to sensors, compute resources, and software for testing constrained edge applications. PROWESS runs edge workloads as sets of containers with access to sensors and specialized hardware on an expandable cluster of light-weight edge nodes which leverage institutional networks to decrease implementation cost and provide wide access to sensors. We implemented a multi-node PROWESS deployment connected to sensors across Ohio State University’s campus. Using three edge-native applications, we demonstrate that PROWESS is simple to configure, has a small resource footprint, scales gracefully, and minimally impacts institutional networks. We also show that PROWESS closely approximates native execution of edge workloads and facilitates experiments that other systems testbeds can not.},

abstract = {Today, In-Vehicle Wireless Sensor Networks (IVWSNs) are being used by car manufacturers because it saves time in the assembling process; saves costs in the harness and after-sales; and makes vehicles lighter, which helps lessen fuel consumption. There is no definition for wireless solution technology for IVWSNs, because each one has its own characteristics, and probably this is one of the reasons for its smooth usage in the automotive industry. A gap identified in wireless sensor networks for the automotive domain is that the related literature focuses only on ordinary cars with a star topology and few of them with mesh topology. This article aims to cover this gap by presenting an experimental study performed on verifying the new Bluetooth 5 technology working in a mesh topology applied to public transportation systems (buses). To perform this evaluation, a setup to emulate an IVWSN was deployed in a working city bus. Measuring the network metrics, the bus was placed in a variety of conditions during its trajectory to determine the influence of the passengers and the whole environment on the data transmission. The results suggest that Bluetooth 5 in a mesh topology is a promising candidate for IVWSNs because it shows the robustness of losing only 0.16% packets in the worst test, as well as its ability to cover a wider range compared to its previous version, indeed a better RSSI and jitter, with lower transmission power, compared to a star topology. The round trip time results can support the analysis for time-critical applications.},

abstract = {In-network/in-switch Access Control List (ACL) is an essential security component of modern networks. In high-speed networks, ACL rules are often placed in a switch's Ternary Content-Addressable Memory (TCAM) for timely ACL match-action and management (e.g. insertion and deletion). However, TCAM-based ACL systems are encountering an scalability issue owing to increasing demand on AI-powered autonomous defenses that detect and block attacks online, which inevitably derives finer-grained ACL rules. Existing solutions minimize the TCAM usage by partially offloading ACL matching into larger Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) or customized hardware. Nevertheless, current SRAM-based solutions induce high management costs, especially a high rule-deployment latency, which delays time-sensitive defense actions. Also, the customized hardware approaches have its own scalability issue. To support autonomous defenses at a scale, in this paper, we propose an in-switch ACL system called PortCatcher, which breaks the trade-off between scalability and rule management latency. System-wise, we detach layer-4 port matching from TCAM for improving its memory efficiency. Algorithm-wise, we introduce a novel port (range) rule representation concept, called linear range map (LRM), which enables port (range) matching in SRAM-based hash tables. LRM guarantees not only fast and scalable port matching but also low-latency ACL management for timely defenses. With real-world ACL datasets, we show that PortCatcher saves 74%-90% TCAM space compared to state-of-the-art approaches by adding small overhead to SRAM (0.49 SRAM entry per ACL rule). Also, we deploy PortCatcher on a programmable switch to demonstrate that PortCatcher can serve 5-tuple rule matching at a line rate, where port rules are completely matched in SRAM. With a use case study, namely autonomous attack mitigation, we show that PortCatcher has a negligible rule management latency to block attack flows (i.e. 94.42% of rules deployed within 10 ms).},

abstract = {In the context of ecological civilization construction, green consumption is of great significance to sustainable development. The generation mechanism and influencing factors of green consumption willingness are worth exploring in depth. Based on consumer value perception and value-belief-norm theory, this study obtained 356 valid samples through questionnaires, with the help of SPSSAU platform to explore the influence of perceived value and sustainable consumption on the willingness to consume green, and the moderating effect of price sensitivity. The results show that the functional, emotional, social, and green values all positively and significantly affect green consumption intention. Also price sensitivity negatively moderates the relationship between perceived value and consumption intention. And sustainable consumption outlook strengthens environmental protection beliefs and ethical norms, and becomes the core driving force of green consumption intention. To further explore consumer heterogeneity, k-means clustering was applied to seven variables. The optimal number of clusters was determined to be two, clearly separating consumers into a price-sensitive group with lower green intention and a high-value-perception group with stronger willingness to consume green. Based on these results, the study proposes the construction of a multi-dimensional value perception system, the implementation of differentiated price strategies, the promotion of sustainable consumption concept education and other guiding paths, to provide theoretical and practical support for the government and enterprises to promote the transformation of green consumption.},

The Kronecker-OMP, a generalization of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) solves the L0 constrained multilinear sparse least-squares problems. However, with the problem dimensions and the number of iterations, the space and computational cost of Kronecker-OMP increase in the polynomial order. Authors have previously developed a generalized least-angle regression(LARS), known as Tensor Least Angle Regression (T-LARS), with a lower asymptotic space and computational complexity than Kronecker-OMP to efficiently solve both L0 and L1 constrained multilinear sparse least-squares problems. In this paper, we used T-LARS to solve multilinear compressed sensing problems and compared the results with Kronecker-OMP, where the T-LARS is 56 times faster than Kronecker-OMP in reconstructing the 3D PET-CT images using compressed sensing samples.},

abstract = {After request completion, an I/O device must decide whether to minimize latency by immediately firing an interrupt or to optimize for throughput by delaying the interrupt, anticipating that more requests will complete soon and help amortize the interrupt cost. Devices employ adaptive interrupt coalescing heuristics that try to balance between these opposing goals. Unfortunately, because devices lack the semantic information about which I/O requests are latency-sensitive, these heuristics can sometimes lead to disastrous results.Instead, we propose addressing the root cause of the heuristics problem by allowing software to explicitly specify to the device if submitted requests are latency-sensitive. The device then “calibrates” its interrupts to completions of latency-sensitive requests. We focus on NVMe storage devices and show that it is natural to express these semantics in the kernel and the application and only requires a modest two-bit change to the device interface. Calibrated interrupts increase throughput by up to 35%, reduce CPU consumption by as much as 30%, and achieve up to 37% lower latency when interrupts are coalesced.},

abstract = {Fair learning has received a lot of attention in recent years since machine learning models can be unfair in automated decision-making systems with respect to sensitive attributes such as gender, race, etc. However, to mitigate the discrimination on the sensitive attributes and train a fair model, most fair learning methods have required to get access to the sensitive attributes in training or validation phases. In this study, we propose a privacy-preserving training algorithm for a fair support vector machine classifier based on Homomorphic Encryption (HE), where the privacy of both sensitive information and model secrecy can be preserved. The expensive computational costs of HE can be significantly improved by protecting only the sensitive information, introducing refined formulation and low-rank approximation using shared eigenvectors. Through experiments on the synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in terms of accuracy and fairness and show that our method significantly outperforms other privacy-preserving solutions in terms of better trade-offs between accuracy and fairness. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first privacy-preserving fair learning algorithm using HE.},

abstract = {Time series data are often with regular time intervals, e.g., in IoT scenarios sensor data collected with a pre-specified frequency, air quality data regularly recorded by outdoor monitors, and GPS signals periodically received from multiple satellites. However, due to various issues such as transmission latency, device failure, repeated request and so on, timestamps could be dirty and lead to irregular time intervals. Amending the irregular time intervals has obvious benefits, not only improving data quality but also leading to more accurate applications such as frequency-domain analysis and more effective compression in storage. The timestamp repairing problem however is challenging, given many interacting factors to determine, including the time interval, the start timestamp, the series length, as well as the matching between the time series before and after repairing. Our contributions in this paper are (1) formalizing the timestamp repairing problem for regular interval time series to minimize the cost w.r.t. move, insert and delete operations; (2) devising an exact approach with advanced pruning strategies based on lower bounds of repairing; (3) proposing an approximation based on bi-directional dynamic programming. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposal in both timestamp repair accuracy and the aforesaid applications. Remarkably, the repair results can be used to evaluate time series data quality measures. Both the repair and measure functions have been implemented in an open-source time series database, Apache IoTDB.},

abstract = {Objectives. Teachers are essential to making computing education available to students. A key place to sustainably prepare computer science (CS) teachers is in pre-service preparation programs, which are often required for certification in the United States. Prior work has examined many reasons that people choose to become teachers — or choose not to — but little prior work has examined factors that shape the pursuit of CS certifications in pre-service in particular. Participants. We recruited five teacher candidates who chose to pursue CS training in a new pre-service teacher preparation program in the United States and five candidates who expressed interest, but ultimately opted out. Method. We conducted semi-structured, remote interviews and performed a thematic analysis to inductively identify factors that influenced candidates’ decisions. Findings. Candidates displayed many conceptions of justice that motivated them to teach CS, including repairing past wrongs in education, improving representation, and expanding literacy. Candidates reported many content knowledge and identity factors, including negative experiences in CS education, low CS self-efficacy, and a sense of not belonging or being respected in CS communities. Capacity for care as novice teachers was another factor: candidates feared not being able to care for students’ needs while experiencing exhaustion from teaching and training during a pandemic, as well as the risks of added course preparation workload from being certified in multiple subject areas. Finally, candidates also considered opportunity costs like loss of income and job security as factors influencing their decisions. Conclusion. These factors highlight the importance of surfacing and dismantling implicit barriers, like injustice and inequity, and explicit barriers, like funding and overwork, so that future teachers feel confident in teaching CS and feel able to create equitable, inclusive environments for students to learn.},

Recently, the placement methods are formulated as an optimization problem and solved by multi-objective optimization (MOO) approaches. This research aims to examine the implementation of MOO for relay placement. The goals of the MOO are to develop a WSN with minimum cost and fault tolerance ability. The MOO method in this research was constructed over a swarm intelligence algorithm. The area with targets and sensors is mapped into triangular cells and relays are placed at the triangular points. This mapping allows each sensor to connect to at least two different relays and construct multi-paths to the sink with the minimum number of relays. With random sensors that cover the entire area, this method uses around 58% to 67% of all relays on average.},

abstract = {Quantitative stock investment is a fundamental financial task that highly relies on accurate prediction of market status and profitable investment decision making. Despite recent advances in deep learning (DL) have shown stellar performance on capturing trading opportunities in the stochastic stock market, the performance of existing DL methods is unstable with sensitivity to network initialization and hyperparameter selection. One major limitation of existing works is that investment decisions are made based on one individual neural network predictor with high uncertainty, which is inconsistent with the workflow in real-world trading firms. To tackle this limitation, we propose AlphaMix, a novel three-stage mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for quantitative investment to mimic the efficient bottom-up hierarchical trading strategy design workflow of successful trading companies. In Stage one, we introduce an efficient ensemble learning method, whose computational and memory costs are significantly lower comparing to traditional ensemble methods, to train multiple groups of trading experts with personalised market understanding and trading styles. In Stage two, we collect diversified investment suggestions through building a pool of trading experts utilizing hyperparameter level and initialization level diversity of neural networks for post hoc ensemble construction. In Stage three, we design three different mechanisms, namely as-needed router, with-replacement selection and integrated expert soup, to dynamically pick experts from the expert pool, which takes the responsibility of a portfolio manager. Through extensive experiments on US and Chinese stock markets, we demonstrate that AlphaMix significantly outperforms many state-of-the-art baselines in terms of 7 popular financial criteria.},

abstract = {With the rapid growth of global tourism, some cities face challenges in balancing economic benefits, environmental protection, and social stability. This study develops a self-adaptive multi-objective optimization model to help govern- ments achieve sustainable tourism development. Taking Juneau (USA) as case studies, a four- dimensional evaluation system covering economic revenue, carbon emissions, infrastructure pressure, and resident satisfaction was constructed. The model integrates a feedback mechanism and genetic algorithm for iterative optimization. Results show that Juneau achieves optimal balance at 8,200 tourists with an expenditure ratio of 1:5:4. Sensitivity analysis identifies economic and resident satisfaction weights as primary determinants, while carbon emissions and infrastructure pressure act as negative factors.Extended applications include dynamic weight adjustment and pricing strategies for undervisited attractions. Projections based on Juneau's statistical data indicate that without intervention, tourist volume will reach 3.75 million in five years, accompanied by 20% higher carbon emissions and 10% lower resident satisfaction. The proposed model provides a flexible, self-regulating framework for policy-makers to optimize visitor management and investment allocation, offering significant strategic value for sustainable urban tourism development.},

abstract = {As digital signals are widely used in various fields such as technology, communications, and software, the digital signal processing platform is part of a long-base tracking system used to perform signal detection and placement. Compared with the traditional analog signal processing platform based on the digital signal processing simulation platform based on DSP and FPGA co-processing technology, the digital signal processing system not only has more advantages in terms of sensitivity and accuracy, but also has lower development cost and Wider application environment requirements. DSP multi-core board and DSP core, FPGA core signal receiving board and back-end circuit design have very important significance. The function of software design is to collect data from the FPGA board and transmit the data to the multi-core DSP through the PCIE bus. DSP and FPGA provide great help for the design of hardware installation. Pay special attention to the circuit design of multi-core DSP board with multi-core DSP, FPGA nuclear signal receiving board and backplane. The function that the software design realizes is FPGA board card gathers the data signal. This paper analyzes the relevant characteristics and theoretical knowledge of DSP and FPGA co-processing technology, transmits data to the multi-core DSP board through the PCIE bus, completes the relevant detection of multi-channel signals on the multi-core DSP board, and realizes the development of a digital signal processing simulation platform. The final result of the research shows that when the real running time is 1523ms, the virtual simulation time is 123ms. When the real running time increases, the virtual simulation time also increases, showing a proportional relationship. The virtual simulation time has a shorter and faster running time.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of live streaming e-commerce, the problem of high return rates has become increasingly prominent, which not only brings consumers a bad shopping experience, but also has a significant impact on the interests of brand retailers and anchors. Consider the return losses caused by returns and the industry reality of anchors receiving confirmed sales commissions, we develop a joint optimization decision model of pricing and effort level in live streaming e-commerce supply chain, and conducts sensitivity analysis and numerical simulation. We find that there is a unique optimal joint decision between brand retailers and anchors when considering returns, and the optimal product sales price and live streaming effort level decrease with the increase of consumers' price sensitivity coefficient and return rate, and increase with the increase of live streaming effort impact coefficient. In addition, if consumers are not sensitive enough to product prices, the supply chain can increase product sales through higher product sales price and higher levels of live streaming effort, if consumers are greatly influenced by the live streaming efforts of the anchor, even if the product price is appropriately increased, the anchor can significantly increase the sales in the live streaming room, and when the return rate increases, the supply chain does not need to significantly lower product price and live streaming effort level. Finally, several management insights were proposed to provide theoretical basis and practical guidance for the efficient collaborative operation of live streaming e-commerce supply chain.},

abstract = {Serverless platforms have exploded in popularity in recent years, but, today, these platforms are still unsuitable for large classes of applications. They perform well for batch-oriented workloads that perform coarse transformations over data asynchronously, but their lack of clear service level agreements (SLAs), high per-invocation overheads, and interference make deploying online applications with stringent response time demands impractical.Our assertion is that beyond the glaring issues like cold start costs, a more fundamental shift is needed in how serverless function invocations are provisioned and scheduled in order to support these more demanding applications. Specifically, we propose a platform that leverages the observability and predictability of serverless functions to enforce multi-resource fairness. We explain why we believe interference across a spectrum of resources (CPU, network, and storage) contributes to lower resource utilization and poor response times for latency-sensitive and high-fanout serverless application patterns. Finally, we propose a new distributed and hierarchical function scheduling architecture that combines lessons from multi-resource fair scheduling, hierarchical scheduling, batch-analytics resource scheduling, and statistics to create an approach that we believe will enable tighter SLAs on serverless platforms than has been possible in the past.},

abstract = {Auto-bidding is now widely adopted as an interface between advertisers and internet advertising as it allows advertisers to specify high-level goals, such as maximizing value subject to a value-per-spend constraint. Prior research has mainly focused on auctions that are truthful (such as a second-price auction) because these auctions admit simple (uniform) bidding strategies and are thus simpler to analyze. The main contribution of this paper is to characterize the efficiency across the spectrum of all auctions, including non-truthful auctions for which optimal bidding may be complex. For deterministic auctions, we show a dominance result: any uniform bidding equilibrium of a second-price auction (SPA) can be mapped to an equilibrium of any other auction – for example, first price auction (FPA) – with identical outcomes. In this sense, SPA with uniform bidding is an instance-wise optimal deterministic auction. Consequently, the price of anarchy (PoA) of any deterministic auction is at least the PoA of SPA with uniform bidding, which is known to be 2. We complement this by showing that the PoA of FPA without uniform bidding is 2. Next, we show, surprisingly, that truthful pricing is not dominant in the randomized setting. There is a randomized version of FPA that achieves a strictly smaller price of anarchy than its truthful counterpart when there are two bidders per query. Furthermore, this randomized FPA achieves the best-known PoA for two bidders, thus showing the power of non-truthfulness when combined with randomization. Finally, we show that no prior-free auction (even randomized, non-truthful) can improve on a PoA bound of 2 when there are a large number of advertisers per auction. These results should be interpreted qualitatively as follows. When the auction pressure is low, randomization and non-truthfulness is beneficial. On the other hand, if the auction pressure is intense, the benefits diminishes and it is optimal to implement a second-price auction.},

abstract = {With the wide adoption of AI applications, there is a pressing need of enabling real-time neural network (NN) inference on small embedded devices, but deploying NNs and achieving high performance of NN inference on these small devices is challenging due to their extremely weak capabilities. Although NN partitioning and offloading can contribute to such deployment, they are incapable of minimizing the local costs at embedded devices. Instead, we suggest to address this challenge via agile NN offloading, which migrates the required computations in NN offloading from online inference to offline learning. In this paper, we present AgileNN, a new NN offloading technique that achieves real-time NN inference on weak embedded devices by leveraging eXplainable AI techniques, so as to explicitly enforce feature sparsity during the training phase and minimize the online computation and communication costs. Experiment results show that AgileNN's inference latency is &gt;6X lower than the existing schemes, ensuring that sensory data on embedded devices can be timely consumed. It also reduces the local device's resource consumption by &gt;8X, without impairing the inference accuracy.},

abstract = {Visual place recognition (VPR) is the challenge of determining whether a sensor is visiting a previously recorded location or exploring new locations using visual inputs. VPR approaches typically presume that the appearance remains the same as the moment the map (reference) was produced. This presents a significant challenge, since the premise of static appearance is invalid. Instead, the environment is constantly changing because of weather, time of day, building sites, the upgrading of facades and billboards, and so on. A prominent way to deal with the resilience of environmental change is to demand the selection of features from unique and non-unique objects. By doing this, a method can properly discriminate the image, but it is computationally expensive. In this paper, we seek to recognize a place efficiently by reducing the number of its features. In particular, we predict unique features and avoid using features from non-unique objects by taking advantage of geo-tags. Our method provides increased accuracy with lower computational costs compared with other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Operating system (OS) is the cornerstone for modern computer systems. It manages devices and provides fundamental service for user-level applications. Thus, detecting bugs in OSes is important to improve reliability and security of computer systems. Static typestate analysis is a common technique for detecting different types of bugs, but it is often inaccurate or unscalable for large-size OS code, due to imprecision of identifying alias relationships as well as high costs of typestate tracking and path-feasibility validation.  In this paper, we present PATA, a novel path-sensitive and aliasaware typestate analysis framework to detect OS bugs. To improve the precision of identifying alias relationships in OS code, PATA performs a path-based alias analysis based on control-flow paths and access paths. With these alias relationships, PATA reduces the costs of typestate tracking and path-feasibility validation, to boost the efficiency of path-sensitive typestate analysis for bug detection. We have evaluated PATA on the Linux kernel and three popular IoT OSes (Zephyr, RIOT and TencentOS-tiny) to detect three common types of bugs (null-pointer dereferences, uninitialized variable accesses and memory leaks). PATA finds 574 real bugs with a false positive rate of 28%. 206 of these bugs have been confirmed by the developers of the four OSes.We also compare PATA to seven state-of-the-art static approaches (Cppcheck, Coccinelle, Smatch,CSA, Infer, Saber and SVF). PATA finds many real bugs missed by them, with a lower false positive rate.},

abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a common diagnostic indicator of heart disease in hospitals. Because of the low price and noninvasiveness of ECG diagnosis, it is widely used for prescreening and physical examination of heart diseases. In several studies on ECG analysis, only rough diagnoses are made to determine whether ECGs are abnormal or on a few kinds of ECG. In actual scenarios, doctors must analyze ECG samples in detail, which is a multilabel classification problem. Herein, we propose Hygeia, a multilabel deep learning-based ECG classification method that can analyze and classify 55 types of ECG. First, a guidance model is constructed to transform the multilabel classification problem into multiple interrelated two-classification models. This method ensures the good performance of each ECG analysis model, and the relationship between various types of ECG can be used in the analysis. The imbalance of samples in ECG datasets makes it difficult to analyze abnormal ECGs with high sensitivity and accuracy. We used data generation and mixed sampling methods for 11 ECG types with imbalanced problems to improve the average accuracy, sensitivity, F1 value, and accuracy from 87.74%, 43.11%, 0.3929, and 0.3929, to 92.68%, 96.92, 0.9287, and 99.47%, respectively. The average accuracy, sensitivity, F1 value, and accuracy of 44 of the 55 tags of the abnormal ECG analysis model are 99.69%, 95.81%, 0.9758, and 99.72%, respectively.},
