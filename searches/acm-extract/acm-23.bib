abstract = {The emergence of flexible multifunctional sensing devices has attracted extensive attention from researchers in the field of wearable devices and artificial intelligence. However, the current multifunctional flexible electronic devices, with low stability and complicated fabrication process, are the key constraints to their wide application. Laser-induced graphene patterned rectangular array sensors prepared by carbonizing polyimide films are highly sensitive to external strain and pressure stimuli. With outstanding mechanical properties and heightened sensitivity, the structured pressure sensor effectively showcases its capacity to detect a broad spectrum of human activities and subtle touches. The sensor adopts a three-layered structure comprising a flexible substrate layer, a conductive sensing layer, and an encapsulation layer. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is employed as the material for both the substrate and encapsulation layers, while laser-induced graphene (LIG) serves as the material for the conductive layer. The resulting patterned pressure sensor exhibits notable sensitivity, with a value of 1.63 kPa-1 within the pressure range of 0 to 40 kPa and 3.5 kPa-1 within the pressure range of 40 to 120 kPa. Furthermore, cyclic load-unload assessments demonstrated the remarkable stability of the sensor. Undergoing compression for 3,000 cycles at a pressure of 60 kPa, the sensor maintained its capability for stable signal detection. In applications such as slide recognition and object grip recognition, the pressure sensor exhibited a noteworthy level of resolution. At the same time, the sensor additionally possesses the capability to monitor human health, and is capable of sensing large body movements and micro-motion sensing signals. Therefore, the sensor can be used for detecting external forces and grasping objects, and has great potential for development in robotics, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interaction.},

abstract = {In order to further improve the generalization ability of the active decision model, a new active decision model based on big data and pattern recognition was constructed by taking agricultural decision making as an example. The characteristics of land remote sensing big data are obtained from two aspects of spectrum and shape. The features of remote sensing big data were input into support vector machine to realize the classification of farmland. Based on this, combined with vector description method, pattern recognition of agricultural environment is completed. Taking grain production, land ecological compatibility minimization and social and economic development as objective functions, an active decision-making model was constructed. The experimental results show that when using the constructed model to make active decisions on farmland, the recall and precision rates can both reach over 95\%, and the time consumption is always less than 20ms.},

abstract = {With the development of smart agriculture, realizing accurate monitoring and management of greenhouse agriculture environment becomes the key to improve the efficiency and quality of agricultural production. This study aims to develop a Raspberry Pi based intelligent greenhouse IoT platform to enhance the automation and intelligence of greenhouse agriculture. This platform utilizes Raspberry Pi as the core controller, integrates multiple environmental sensors for real-time data acquisition, such as temperature and humidity, light intensity, etc., and optimizes the accuracy of the data through Kalman filtering algorithm. The Raspberry Pi also assumes the function of an IoT gateway to securely and efficiently transmit data to the cloud for remote storage and processing. In addition, this study also developed the supporting mobile APP and computer client software to provide users with an intuitive interface for data monitoring and remote control. In terms of energy management, by applying the BBPSO algorithm to optimize the angle of solar panels, this platform effectively improves the energy utilization efficiency and guarantees the sustainable operation of the system. The results of this study not only improve the management efficiency and crop production quality of greenhouse agriculture, but also provide a useful reference for the future technological development of smart agriculture.},

abstract = {With the improvement of people's living standards and the development of science and technology, smart home system has become an inevitable choice for people to optimize their living environment and improve their quality of life. However, at present, the functional services of smart home system are mostly focused on interactive control, security and entertainment, but lack of monitoring of indoor environment. In this regard, this paper will take the indoor air environment quality as the research object, and build an multi-sensor home environment monitoring intelligent node based on ZigBee technology, sensor technology and CAN bus technology, so as to achieve the purpose of real-time, accurate and efficient monitoring of the home environment. At the bottom of the intelligent node are many air quality monitoring sensors, which mainly collect data such as temperature, humidity, particulate matter and formaldehyde concentration. The middle layer is the data transmission layer, and the bus circuit composed of ZigBee and CAN is used to realize the function of sending and receiving communication data. The upper layer is the upper computer, which is responsible for the transmission of commands and the response of functional applications. Practice has proved that integrating multi-sensors into an intelligent node by means of ZigBee technology and CAN bus technology can realize comprehensive monitoring of indoor air quality at home and reduce the wiring difficulty and cost consumption of smart home system, which has high market promotion value.},

abstract = {To investigate the feasibility of marine environmental monitoring using optical fibers embedded within submarine cables, an underwater distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) experiment was conducted in the northern waters off the Zhairuo Mountain in Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province. Specific acoustic signals were generated at several different locations by shipborne transducers, and both the DAS-instrumented submarine optical fibers and traditional hydrophones received the signals simultaneously. Though the submarine optical fibers actually observed the strain signals induced by the transducer-generated acoustic signals on the cable surface, the strain signals could be demodulated and transformed to acoustic signals by a DAS demodulator, which is connected to one end of the optical fiber. By comparing the acoustic signals obtained by the receivers in the time-frequency domain, our results demonstrated that the DAS-instrumented submarine cable works effectively as an underwater acoustic sensor array, which was distributed along the cable route on the seafloor. The research findings have significant implications for underwater acoustic monitoring using submarine cables, as well as for underwater wireless data transmission and communication.},

abstract = {Along with rapid urbanization, there always has been an increasing number of industrial parks within or around urban areas to promote economic development. Construction of the industrial parks also changes the original land cover and land use, which may cause urban thermal environmental problems to some extent. At present, in terms of urban thermal environment, most studies have been conducted at city scale, while there have been a few studies discussing the issues on industrial parks. In this study, two neighboring county-level cities (i.e. Jinjiang and Shishi, named Jinjiang-Shishi) in Quanzhou city, being located in southeast Fujian Province, China, were taken as the study area. Considering the spatial resolution of Landsat-8 satellite remote sensing images and the area size of industrial parks, four types with 70 industrial parks were collected correspondingly, including manufacturing (MF), manufacturing, wholesale and retail (MWRT), manufacturing, leasing and business services (MLBS), and transportation, storage and postal industry (TSPI). The Collection 2 Level-2 products of Landsat-8 were used, from which land surface temperature (LST) and the reflectance-based indices (or components) were derived. Preliminary findings showed that the surface temperature of industrial parks was relatively higher, both in summer and winter cases. Generally, the TSPI was provided with the highest LST, whereas the MF and MWRT shared similar pattern but being lower in LST. Meanwhile, for winter cases the MLBS was the lowest in LST. Investigating the thermal environment of industrial parks is an important initiative, to find out the influencing factors and propose useful mitigation measures.},

abstract = {Whispering is a common privacy-preserving technique in voice-based interactions, but its effectiveness is limited in noisy environments. In conventional hardware- and software-based noise reduction approaches, isolating whispered speech from ambient noise and other speech sounds remains a challenge. We thus propose WhisperMask, a mask-type microphone featuring a large diaphragm with low sensitivity, making the wearer’s voice significantly louder than the background noise. We evaluated WhisperMask using three key metrics: signal-to-noise ratio, quality of recorded voices, and speech recognition rate. Across all metrics, WhisperMask consistently outperformed traditional noise-suppressing microphones and software-based solutions. Notably, WhisperMask showed a 30\% higher recognition accuracy for whispered speech recorded in an environment with 80 dB background noise compared with the pin microphone and earbuds. Furthermore, while a denoiser decreased the whispered speech recognition rate of these two microphones by approximately 20\% at 30-60 dB noise, WhisperMask maintained a high performance even without denoising, surpassing the other microphones’ performances by a significant margin.  WhisperMask’s design renders the wearer’s voice as the dominant input and effectively suppresses background noise without relying on signal processing. This device allows for reliable voice interactions, such as phone calls and voice commands, in a wide range of noisy real-world scenarios while preserving user privacy.},

We believe that one ultimate solution to bridge the gap between virtual and real worlds is to enable virtual entities to interact with the real world seamlessly and physically. However, unlike major approaches such as displaying haptics directly onto real users, letting virtual entities affect the real world physically is an underrepresented field in AR. To explore this approach, we employ reality actuators, here a robot arm, behind an AR VH as it may improve the sense of social presence and engagement in human-robot interaction systems. We developed an AR system where a VH is overlaid onto a robotic arm participating in a chess game. The preliminary results of our pilot study suggest the system’s significant potential to not only enhance the perceived social presence of VHs but also increase overall presence and user engagement, especially compared to situations where the mechanisms are visible without virtual concealment. We hope this work paves the way for more seamless reality experience between real and virtual worlds.},

abstract = {Software call stack is a sequence of function calls that are executed during the runtime of a software program. Software call stack analysis (CSA) is widely used in software engineering to analyze the runtime behavior of software, which can be used to optimize the software performance, identify bugs, and profile the software. Despite the benefits of CSA, it has recently come under scrutiny due to concerns about privacy. To date, software is often deployed at user-side devices like mobile phones and smart watches. The collected call stacks may thus contain privacy-sensitive information, such as healthy information or locations, depending on the software functionality. Leaking such information to third parties may cause serious privacy concerns such as discrimination and targeted advertisement.This paper presents PP-CSA, a practical and privacy-preserving CSA framework that can be deployed in real-world scenarios. Our framework leverages local differential privacy (LDP) as a principled privacy guarantee, to mutate the collected call stacks and protect the privacy of individual users. Furthermore, we propose several key design principles and optimizations in the technical pipeline of PP-CSA, including an encoder-decoder scheme to properly enforce LDP over software call stacks, and several client/server-side optimizations to largely improve the efficiency of PP-CSA. Our evaluation over real-world Java and Android programs shows that our privacy-preserving CSA pipeline can achieve high utility and privacy guarantees while maintaining high efficiency. We have released our implementation of PP-CSA as an open-source project at  for results reproducibility. We will provide more detailed documents to support and the usage and extension of the community.},

abstract = {Serverless computing platforms rely on fast container initialization to provide low latency and high throughput for requests. While hardware enforced trusted execution environments (TEEs) have gained popularity, confidential computing has yet to be widely adopted by latency-sensitive platforms due to its additional initialization overhead. We investigate the application of AMD's Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) to microVMs and find that current startup times for confidential VMs are prohibitively slow due to the high cost of establishing a root of trust for each new VM.We present SEVeriFast, a new bootstrap scheme for SEV VMs that reevaluates current microVM techniques for fast boot, such as eliminating bootstrap stages and bypassing guest kernel decompression. Counter-intuitively, we find that introducing an additional bootstrap component and reintroducing kernel compression optimizes the cold boot performance of SEV microVMs by reducing the cost of measurement on the critical boot path and producing a minimal root of trust. To our knowledge, SEVeriFast is the first work to explore the trade-offs associated with booting confidential microVMs and provide a set of guiding principles as a step toward confidential serverless. We show that SEVeriFast improves cold start performance of SEV VMs over current methods by 86-93\%.},

The goal was to elicit values, identify value tensions, and resolve these tensions in the design of a system that allows Streamers to share their live experiences with a remote Viewer. Leveraging the lens of value-sensitive design (VSD), we found that these different stakeholders prioritized different values in design, but possibly due to our prompt to design for someone they cared about/knew, often accounted for one another's needs in their solutions to arrive at designs that were affordable, unobtrusive, and socially acceptable for the Streamer, while giving the Viewer a sense of autonomy. Our work highlights the strengths of co-design when eliciting important human values in the design of sociotechnical systems for wearable telepresence, reconciling value tensions, and conceptualizing novel hardware- and software-based solutions for enhancing the interpersonal telepresence experience of both viewers and streamers. A key insight from our study is that no single system will meet all users' needs; therefore, we should move towards building customizable toolkits to account for differing values and needs.},

In Germany, relevant stakeholder groups (e.g., ethics committees and data protection authorities) specified the broad consent form; however, only one group of patient representatives was consulted, which may indicate asymmetries in engagement. This situation informed our research on medical data donation and emphasized foregrounding patient values. Drawing on participatory design, value sensitive design, and emerging research on value-led participation, we propose a method consisting of (1) a workshop concept for participatory value elicitation composed of four carefully coordinated phases and (2) an analysis procedure to examine the empirical data collected. This analysis allowed us to derive design requirements for medical data donation user interfaces. We conducted three workshops with patient advocates of vulnerable groups and patients in residential care of a psychosomatic unit. Our findings provide new directions to improve user interfaces for medical data donation: First, user interfaces need to enhance patients' reflective thinking about the potential consequences of their data donation; second, a decision facilitator supporting patients' value-based decision-making (e.g., by providing simple language or tailoring descriptions to patient needs); and finally, a data intermediary relieving patients' decision-making and giving them control over their data after donation. Moreover, we emphasize the need to increase the use of participatory approaches in health technology development.},

We then shared these videos with 15 participants including student-athletes, coaches, and designers. Drawing on the perspectives of student-athletes, team staff, and designers embedded in the videos and expressed in reaction to the videos, we describe preferences for boundaries on tracking and sharing, how tracking data represent athletes, and for data practices. We also propose design requirements and recommendations for use to better align tracking technologies with these preferences.},

abstract = {This paper presents HandFi, which constructs hand skeletons with practical WiFi devices. Unlike previous WiFi hand sensing systems that primarily employ predefined gestures for pattern matching, by constructing the hand skeleton, HandFi can enable a variety of downstream WiFi-based hand sensing applications in gaming, healthcare, and smart homes. Deriving the skeleton from WiFi signals is challenging, especially because the palm is a dominant reflector compared with fingers. HandFi develops a novel multi-task learning neural network with a series of customized loss functions to capture the low-level hand information from WiFi signals. During offline training, HandFi takes raw WiFi signals as input and uses the leap motion to provide supervision. During online use, only with commercial WiFi, HandFi is capable of producing 2D hand masks as well as 3D hand poses. We demonstrate that HandFi can serve as a foundation model to enable developers to build various applications such as finger tracking and sign language recognition, and outperform existing WiFi-based solutions.

abstract = {In-time disease assessment is essential to better customize the medication scheme and improve the quality of life for chronic diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD). Toward the inconvenience problem in current clinical assessment practice, mobile sensing solutions based on detecting Parkinson's vocal changes are proposed. However, current solutions either can only achieve binary disease detection task or require patients to perform specific speaking tasks, which is not effective and practical for disease stage assessment in daily scenario. Moreover, most of existing solutions do not take speech privacy into consideration. In this work, we present PDAssess, a free speech-based daily assessment system that can perform 4-stage Parkinson's disease assessment in a privacy-preserving manner. We observe that current solutions did not fully leverage the rich information embedded in free speech due to the linguistic content variations, and therefore leverage a pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) model to achieve a content variation-aware feature-extraction. In order to distinguish subtle stage-wise differences, we design a novel attention-based neural network architecture with a customized loss function for disease assessment task. Towards the potential privacy leakage problem, we design a Split Learning-based framework with pseudo-labeling and local domain adversarial training to better preserve speech content privacy. We collaborate with a medical center and evaluate the performance of PDAssess on real-world speech data collected from 50 PD subjects and 50 healthy subjects. The evaluation result shows that PDAssess can perform 4-stage PD assessment with an average person-wise F1 score of 89.1\% and voice sample-wise F1 score of 75.1\%.},

abstract = {Food waste is one of the greatest economic and ethical challenges in the world. Empowering consumers with the ability to assess the quality of fruit can be a game changer for reducing waste and motivating a healthier diet. In this paper, we present Meta-Sticker a novel low-cost non-invasive solution for accurate fruit sensing via a sub-THz metamaterial sticker. The key idea is to exploit fruit as a substrate for resonating meta-atoms. Changes in the chemical composite of the fruit over time (e.g., sugar and water concentration) yield variation in the dielectric properties of the fruit (here substrate). Interestingly, this would affect the resonant frequency of the Meta-Sticker. We design Meta-Sticker to resonate in the sub-THz bands for their sensitivity to water, mm-scale penetration depth, and non-ionizing features that offer high-resolution inferences from the inner pulp of the fruit. We develop a model that translates the resonance of Meta-Sticker to well-known ripeness metrics, namely Dry Matter and Brix. We fabricate Meta-Sticker on paper and conduct extensive over-the-air experiments. We demonstrate that our system can estimate Brix and Dry Matter in three different types of fruits with an average Normalized RMSE value of 1.24\%, an error that yields a negligible impact on taste and is imperceptible by the consumer. Our design is non-invasive, low-cost (less than a cent), passive, biodegradable, and conformal.},

abstract = {The emerging reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technique introduces novel threats to wireless sensing owing to its channel customization ability. Unlike active radios, the RIS's interference behaves akin to natural reflections, exhibiting a higher level of stealthiness and difficulty in detection. However, the majority of current RIS-based attacks lack generalizability to real-world scenarios, as they assume complete coverage of the RIS over objects and develop their techniques within electromagnetic-controlled environments such as an anechoic chamber. To bridge this gap, we present RIStealth, a practical and covert attack that leverages RIS technology to render a moving individual undetectable by WiFi-based intrusion detection systems in real-life scenarios. RIStealth integrates the strengths of both motion reduction and threshold lifting strategies to address challenges of limited RIS affordability, constrained cooperation in adversary settings, and complex and unpredictable environments. Through real-world evaluations conducted with our RIS prototype, we demonstrate that RIStealth effectively reduces the victim's intrusion detection rate from 95.1\% to 16.4\%. Our findings shed light on the practical threats posed by RIS, thereby encouraging further countermeasure development.},

Conventional pose estimations deploy sensors as fixed infrastructure, which significantly restrains the mobility of the user. Inspired by the emerging head-mounted devices (e.g., VR/AR glasses) and the recent advance in low-cost mmWave radar, we present mmEgo, the first egocentric human pose estimation design using a head-mounted mmWave radar, which offers ubiquitous pose tracking with high mobility, robustness to complex environments, and privacy preservation. To tackle the unique challenges of radar sensing from the egocentric perspective (e.g., random radar motion and the scarcity of information on the lower body), we propose several technical designs, including root-relative radar motion tracking for radar motion decoupling and a two-stage pose estimator that incorporates human kinematics priors. Extensive experiments and case studies show that our method can reduce the joint localization error by 44.2\% and potentially enable a wide spectrum of applications.},

IoT devices and apps may collect and analyse sensitive personal data, which is often protected by data privacy laws, some within highly regulated domains such as healthcare. Privacy-by-design (PbD) schemes can be used by developers to consider data privacy at the design stage. However, software developers are not widely adopting these approaches due to difficulties in understanding and interpreting them. There are currently a limited number of tools available for developers to use in this context. We believe that a successful PbD tool should be able to (i) assist developers in addressing privacy requirements in less regulated domains, as well as (ii) help them learn about privacy as they use the tool. The findings of two controlled lab studies are presented, involving 42 developers. We discuss how such a PbD tool can help novice IoT developers comply with privacy laws (e.g., GDPR) and follow privacy guidelines (e.g., privacy patterns). Based on our findings, such tools can help raise awareness of data privacy requirements at design. This increases the likelihood that subsequent designs will be more aware of data privacy requirements.},

abstract = {Stream processing is becoming increasingly significant in various scenarios, including security-sensitive sectors. It benefits from keeping data in memory, which exposes large volumes of data in use, thereby emphasising the need for protection. The recent development of confidential computing makes such protection technologically feasible. However, these new hardware-based protection methods incur performance overhead. Our evaluation shows that replacing legacy VMs with confidential VMs to run streaming applications incurs up to 8.5\% overhead on the throughput of the queries we tested in the NEXMark benchmark suite. Pursuing specialised protection for broader attacks, such as attacks at the edge with more physical exposure, can push this overhead further. In this paper, we propose a resource scheduling strategy for stream processing applications tailored to the privacy needs of specific application functions. We implement this system model using Apache Flink, a widely-used stream processing framework, making it aware of the underlying cluster's protection capability and scheduling the application functions across resources with different protections tailored to the privacy requirements of an application and the available deployment environment.},

While increasingly used in various application areas, EEG headsets tend to be suited only to a laboratory environment due to the long preparation time to don the headset and the need for users to remain stationary. We present our design of a dry, dual-electrodes flexible PCB assembly that realizes accurate sensing in the face of practical motion artifacts. Using it, we present WalkingWizard, our prototype dry-electrode EEG baseball cap that can be used under motion in everyday scenarios. We first evaluated its hardware performance by comparing its electrode-scalp impedance and ability to capture alpha rhythm against both wet EEG and commercially available dry EEG headsets. We then tested WalkingWizard using steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) experiments, achieving high classification accuracy of 87\% for walking speeds up to 5.0 km/h, beating state-of-the-art. Expanding on WalkingWizard, we integrated all necessary electronic components into a flexible PCB assembly—realizing WalkingWizard Integrated, in a truly wearable form-factor. Utilizing WalkingWizard Integrated, we demonstrated several applications as proof-of-concept: classification of SSVEP in VR environment while walking, real-time acquisition of emotional state of users while moving around the neighbourhood, and understanding the effect of guided meditation for relaxation.},

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) relies on a central authority to oversee and aggregate model updates contributed by multiple participating parties in the training process. This centralization of sensitive model updates naturally raises concerns about the trustworthiness of the central aggregation server, as well as the potential risks associated with server failures or breaches, which could result in loss and leaks of model updates. Moreover, recent attacks have demonstrated that, by obtaining the leaked model updates, malicious actors can even reconstruct substantial amounts of private data belonging to training participants. This underscores the critical necessity to rethink the existing FL system architecture to mitigate emerging attacks in the evolving threat landscape. One straightforward approach is to fortify the central aggregator with confidential computing (CC), which offers hardware-assisted protection for runtime computation and can be remotely verified for execution integrity. However, a growing number of security vulnerabilities have surfaced in tandem with the adoption of CC, indicating that depending solely on this singular defense may not provide the requisite resilience to thwart data leaks.To address the security challenges inherent in the centralized aggregation paradigm and enhance system resilience, we introduce DeTA, an FL system architecture that employs a decentralized and trustworthy aggregation strategy with a defense-in-depth design. In DeTA, FL parties locally divide and shuffle their model updates at the parameter level, creating random partitions designated for multiple aggregators, all of which are shielded within CC execution environments. Moreover, to accommodate the multi-aggregator FL ecosystem, we have implemented a two-phase authentication protocol that enables new parties to verify all CC-protected aggregators and establish secure channels to upstream their model updates. With DeTA, model aggregation algorithms can function without any alterations. However, each aggregator is now oblivious to model architectures, possessing only a fragmented and shuffled view of each model update. This approach effectively mitigates attacks aimed at tampering with the aggregation process or exploiting leaked model updates, while also preserving training accuracy and minimizing performance overheads.},

abstract = {Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is the process of identifying human activity states based on collected data, with applications in health monitoring, rehabilitation therapy, and smart homes. However, accurate recognition often necessitates the use of multiple sensors, which can cause discomfort and significantly reduce practicality and convenience. Currently, smartphones with embedded sensors have broadened the potential for HAR, enabling healthcare monitoring, life logging, fitness tracking, and more. This paper conducts experiments on the WISDM public dataset and a self-collected dataset, demonstrating that a one-dimensional convolutional neural network structure does not necessarily underperform a two-dimensional one, using only accelerometer data. Moreover, the experimental results on the self-collected dataset suggest that utilizing the barometer built into smartphones can enhance activity recognition rates. Specifically, we first built the corresponding convolutional neural network model and conducted experiments on the WISDM dataset, and the accuracy reached 95.42\%. Next, we collected data from the smartphone’s embedded barometer and accelerometer to construct a dataset. Experimental results on our self-collected dataset show that the inclusion of barometer data can improve the accuracy of activity recognition, especially stair-related activities. The F1-score for identifying walking, ascending stairs, and descending stairs increased by 6.7\%, 7.39\%, and 2.99\% respectively.},

By implementing the incremental transmission strategy, data compression can be performed with minimal computational energy expenditure, reducing the number of data transmissions and conserving node energy. Experimental results demonstrate that, when utilizing a 1000mAh lithiumion battery, the implementation of energy-saving strategies enables the node to sustain operation for up to 400 hours, significantly extending the lifespan of the forestry IoT system. The results of this study can be applied to the actual deployment of forestry IoTs, effectively extending node life, and improving network reliability.},

An IoT-based corn yield prediction and analysis system was designed. The system collects environmental data (such as soil temperature, humidity, light intensity, etc.) during the growth process of corn by building a sensor network and cloud platform, and processes and analyzes the data in real time. Using the VMD-BP model algorithm, combining historical and real-time data, future corn yield predictions are made and presented to users through a visual interface. Experimental results show that the system has chief advantages in prediction accuracy and real-time and can effectively improve the efficiency and yield of maize planting.

abstract = {The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved various application areas, such as healthcare, smart energy management, and autonomous vehicles. These devices continuously transmit time-series data that can be utilized by a variety of applications to provide personalized services. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in these application areas to input time-series data into prompts for in-context learning and to retrieve relevant responses accordingly. The time-series data contains sensitive information, and its processing can lead to privacy concerns. Several solutions have been proposed in the literature using differential privacy, which protects single data points or batch-wise privacy preservation through manual configuration of the privacy parameter (ɛ). In this paper, we propose an adaptive contextual privacy preservation method that analyzes the data attributes required for specific application services, acting as context. It then identifies sensitive attributes and adaptively selects the value of ɛ for each data attribute to maintain a balance between privacy and service requirements. The proposed approach was evaluated using power consumption and solar power generation datasets. The results show that the proposed approach dynamically selects the privacy parameter for each data attribute. Moreover, the original and anonymized data were fed into the prompt to assess the textual responses generated by LLM. The results show that our proposed approach achieved an average degree of semantic similarity score of 94.5\% for power consumption data and 95.23\% for solar power generation data.},

abstract = {Feeling part of a group is a basic human need that significantly influences an individual's behavior, long-term engagement, and job satisfaction. A strong sense of belonging holds particular importance within software delivery teams, which grapple with challenges related to well-being and employee retention. However, the specific factors closely associated with the sense of belonging in the context of software delivery teams remain largely unknown. Without a clear understanding of these factors, organizations' efforts to promote a sense of belonging and diversity and inclusion more broadly may prove ineffective. Based on existing literature, we identified key factors potentially relevant to the sense of belonging in software delivery teams, such as work appreciation and psychological safety, and investigated the interrelation among these factors. We surveyed members of software delivery teams (n=10,781) of a major software delivery organization and used Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to evaluate a theoretical model to understand the factors that might contribute to a sense of belonging to the team. We also conducted a multi-group analysis to evaluate how the associations change based on individuals' leadership involvement and an importance-performance map analysis to find the most critical indicators of belongingness. Our findings indicate a positive association between psychological safety and work appreciation and belonging to the team. Women feel less belonging than men, especially those not in leadership positions. Authoritativeness is negatively associated with belonging, and tenure is positively associated with belonging regardless of the role. Through this research, we seek to provide insights into the sense of belonging to the team and foster a more inclusive and cohesive work environment.},

abstract = {Multi-sensor fusion stands as a pivotal technique in addressing numerous safety-critical tasks and applications, e.g., self-driving cars and automated robotic arms. With the continuous advancement in data-driven artificial intelligence (AI), MSF's potential for sensing and understanding intricate external environments has been further amplified, bringing a profound impact on intelligent systems and specifically on their perception systems. Similar to traditional software, adequate testing is also required for AI-enabled MSF systems. Yet, existing testing methods primarily concentrate on single-sensor perception systems (e.g., image-based and point cloud-based object detection systems). There remains a lack of emphasis on generating multi-modal test cases for MSF systems.To address these limitations, we design and implement MultiTest, a fitness-guided metamorphic testing method for complex MSF perception systems. MultiTest employs a physical-aware approach to synthesize realistic multi-modal object instances and insert them into critical positions of background images and point clouds. A fitness metric is designed to guide and boost the test generation process. We conduct extensive experiments with five SOTA perception systems to evaluate MultiTest from the perspectives of: (1) generated test cases' realism, (2) fault detection capabilities, and (3) performance improvement. The results show that MultiTest can generate realistic and modality-consistent test data and effectively detect hundreds of diverse faults of an MSF system under test. Moreover, retraining an MSF system on the test cases generated by MultiTest can improve the system's robustness. Our replication package and synthesized testing dataset are publicly available at https://sites.google.com/view/msftest.},

abstract = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) must be able to operate in a wide range of scenarios including those in the long tail distribution that include rare but safety-critical events. The collection of sensor input and expected output datasets from such scenarios is crucial for the development and testing of such systems. Yet, approaches to quantify the extent to which a dataset covers test specifications that capture critical scenarios remain limited in their ability to discriminate between inputs that lead to distinct behaviors, and to render interpretations that are relevant to AV domain experts. To address this challenge, we introduce S3C, a framework that abstracts sensor inputs to coverage domains that account for the spatial semantics of a scene. The approach leverages scene graphs to produce a sensor-independent abstraction of the AV environment that is interpretable and discriminating. We provide an implementation of the approach and a study for camera-based autonomous vehicles operating in simulation. The findings show that S3C outperforms existing techniques in discriminating among classes of inputs that cause failures, and offers spatial interpretations that can explain to what extent a dataset covers a test specification. Further exploration of S3C with open datasets complements the study findings, revealing the potential and shortcomings of deploying the approach in the wild.},

abstract = {Research into Fish Tank Virtual Reality (FTVR) techniques commonly uses specific wearable sensors such as infrared cameras, glasses, or helmets to estimate the position of the user’s eyes. However, using only existing RGB cameras on laptops is more affordable for users as they are already widely available on devices. In this work, we continue and increase previous results using face feature detection software to implement the FTVR technique in 3D applications using standard laptops without needing extra devices. The main contribution is to enhanced the Parallax Engine solution to: 1)This work also defines and tests a protocol to evaluate the user experience and the sense of the presence of the Parallax Engine; 2) adding a new dimension in parallax mode (Parallax3DoF), with freedom of horizontal, vertical and depth movement with cameras in 3D scenes; 3) we eliminate the need for Python servers and the intermediation of network communication between Unity and these servers; and 4) improve integration, performance, and user experience of monoscopic FTVR mode (FishTank), with the virtual camera locked in the 3D environment of laptop screens. Parallax Engine uses Google Media Pipe for face mesh detection via an open-source implementation called the Media Pipe Plugin, available for Unity. We evaluated the proposed solution and almost doubled the FPS of the tool. In addition, we did not find fatigue problems, the interface was considered very good on the SUS scale, and the immersion was considered acceptable. We also compared the immersion and user experience of the FishTank and Parallax3DoF visualization modes, and the users evaluated better the Parallax3DoF in both. We aim in future work to explore this technique further and test it with more users.},

abstract = {Modern autonomous systems require extensive testing to ensure reliability and build trust in ground vehicles. However, testing these systems in the real-world is challenging due to the lack of large and diverse datasets, especially in edge cases. Therefore, simulations are necessary for their development and evaluation. However, existing open-source simulators often exhibit a significant gap between synthetic and real-world domains, leading to deteriorated mobility performance and reduced platform reliability when using simulation data. To address this issue, our Scoping Autonomous Vehicle Simulation (SAVeS) platform benchmarks the performance of simulated environments for autonomous ground vehicle testing between synthetic and real-world domains. Our platform aims to quantify the domain gap and enable researchers to develop and test autonomous systems in a controlled environment. Additionally, we propose using domain adaptation technologies to address the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data with our SAVeS+ extension. Our results demonstrate that SAVeS+ is effective in helping to close the gap between synthetic and real-world domains and yields comparable performance for models trained with processed synthetic datasets to those trained on real-world datasets of same scale. Finally, we introduce two new autonomy driving datasets with complex scenes, essential sensor data, ground truth and improved imagery. The data is generated using both open-source and commercial simulators and processed through our SAVeS+ domain adaptation pipeline. This paper highlights our efforts to quantify and address the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data for autonomy simulation. By enabling researchers to develop and test autonomous systems in a controlled environment, we hope to bring autonomy simulation one step closer to realization.1},

abstract = {To compare and select machine learning models, relying on performance measures alone may not always be sufficient. This is particularly the case where different subsets, features, and predicted results may vary in importance relative to the task at hand. Explanation and visualization techniques are required to support model sensemaking and informed decision-making. However, a review shows that existing systems are mostly designed for model developers and not evaluated with target users in their effectiveness. To address this issue, this research proposes an interactive visualization, VMS (Visualization for Model Sensemaking and Selection), for users of the model to compare and select predictive models. VMS integrates performance-, instance-, and feature-level analysis to evaluate models from multiple angles. Particularly, a feature view integrating the value and contribution of hundreds of features supports model comparison on local and global scales. We exemplified VMS for comparing models predicting patients’ hospital length of stay through time-series health records and evaluated the prototype with 16 participants from the medical field. Results reveal evidence that VMS supports users to rationalize models in multiple ways and enables users to select the optimal models with a small sample size. User feedback suggests future directions on incorporating domain knowledge in model training, such as for different patient groups considering different sets of features as important.},

abstract = {Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a routinely tested biochemical index for patients with cancers. Usually, the index is analyzed using the blood and then the patient's condition is evaluated. Here, we proposed a method to obtain the index from sweat and thus designed a wearable, low-cost electrochemical sensing system for rapid and quantitative testing of CEA in sweat. The system is composed of a sensor with sweat extraction and electrochemical sensing and a self-developed potentiostat. The sensors were designed with screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) modified with AuNPs/rGO, which were successfully synthesized using electrochemical deposition method. Then, the chip was assembled by combing the modified SPEs with a microfluidic sweat collector. The chip we designed enables in vivo skin adhesion and sweat collection for analyzing CEA. The performance of the sensing system was validated with the reversible electrochemical reaction indicator K3[Fe(CN)6]. The results show the system can test CEA in the linear range of 0.2∼100 ng/mL.},

abstract = {Edge Computing, a rapidly evolving sector within information technology, redefines data processing and analysis by shifting it closer to the data source, away from centralized cloud servers. This paradigm promises substantial benefits for diverse applications. In the realm of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Federated Learning emerges as a pioneering technique that harnesses Edge Computing for statistical model training. Federated Learning presents numerous advantages over traditional centralized Machine Learning, including reduced latency, heightened privacy, and real-time data processing. Nonetheless, it introduces concerns regarding energy consumption, particularly for battery-powered Edge devices designed for remote or harsh environments. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of power consumption within the context of Federated Learning operations. To achieve this, a Raspberry Pi 4 and an INA 219 current sensor are employed. Results show that, during communication operations, the power consumption of the target device increases from a minimum of 8\% to a maximum of 32\% with respect to its idle state. During the local training operations it increases respectively by up to 32\% for a CNN model and by up to 40\% for a RNN model.},

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed approach where numerous devices train a shared global model for Machine Learning (ML) tasks. At every training round, the client devices must share their new local gradients with the central server to update the global model. Hence, FL requires high communication costs in terms of bandwidth and the number of messages exchanged between FL clients and the central server, leading to many issues, such as communication bottlenecks and scaling in the network. Consequently, having all devices participating in every training round is not practical. Moreover, the devices' local datasets are usually not Independent and Identically Distributed (IID), posing additional challenges for training the global model. In this sense, we introduce a Clustered Client Selection Framework (CCSF) to decrease the overall communication costs for training an ML model in the FL environment. CCSF clusters the client devices and employs a biased client selection strategy with two main objectives: (i) reducing the number of devices training at every round; and (ii) the number of rounds required to reach convergence. Our experimental evaluations, conducted on two well-known datasets, MNIST and MotionSense, show that CCSF is highly efficient, where the clients' local datasets can be grouped into homogeneous clusters. In MNIST, CCSF reaches an accuracy score above 60\% in less than 50 rounds compared to FedAvg at 50\% after 100 rounds. The performance gap is wider in the MotionSense data. CCSF reaches an accuracy score of 70\% in a little more than 20 training rounds compared to FedAvg below 30\% of accuracy in the first 100 FL rounds.},

abstract = {Applying services computing to neural networks, a service provider may provide inference with a pre-trained neural network as a service. Clients use the service to get the neural network's output on their input. To protect sensitive data, secure neural network inference (SNNI) entails that only the client learns the output; the input remains the client's secret and the neural network's parameters remain the service provider's secret. Several SNNI approaches were proposed and evaluated in environments where both service providers and clients used powerful computers.In many real settings, for instance in edge computing, client devices are resource-constrained. This paper is the first to investigate the impact of client-side resource constraints on SNNI. We perform experiments with two state-of-the-art SNNI approaches and three neural networks. We vary the compute and memory capacity of the client device and measure the impact on inference time. Our findings show that client-side resource constraints significantly impact the performance and even the applicability of SNNI approaches. The results indicate the limits of current SNNI approaches for resource-constrained clients. Based on the results, we identify research directions to improve SNNI for resource-constrained clients.},

abstract = {Nowadays, thanks to the ever-increasing hardware capacity of Edge computing, the achievement of Ubiquitous Computing is no longer a utopia, even though it presents still several challenges. In this paper, we introduce the concept of the Cloud-Edge-Client Continuum, by extending the well-known Cloud-Edge Continuum paradigm with the addition of Clients as deployment nodes. Specifically, we propose both a system architecture and a piece of middleware that allows a web browser to be used seamlessly as a deployment Client node, introducing the concept of a Virtual Point of Deployment (VPod). Our solution allows to: a) leverage the computational capacity of a huge number of ready-to-use devices that do not require the installation of any dependencies; b) optimize the use of resources with clear benefits for end users, who can take advantage of their computing capacity to process sensitive data; c) reduce infrastructure costs. In addition, our proposal opens toward a multitude of scenarios, as the logical division that exists in the common client-server architecture is overcome, enabling the creation of a Cloud-Edge-Client Continuum environment.},

A control module has been developed based on the MSP430 series microcontroller. After receiving instructions from the cloud server, the module sends a control signal to the water quality sensor according to the settings, reads the water quality data feedback from the water quality sensor in real-time, and calibrates it. Then, the calibrated data is sent to the cloud server through the 4G module through the Modbus protocol, achieving real-time display and storage of water-quality data.

abstract = {To enhance the safety of miners during their work in mines and further improve the underground security systems, we propose the development of an intelligent mine safety protection device based on the STM32 microcontroller. This device integrates multiple sensors and employs the exponential smoothing algorithm for predictive analysis. Traditional safety measures in underground mines have been limited in scope and have left some safety gaps for workers. To address these issues, we utilize a network of sensors to provide real-time monitoring of the underground environment, ensuring the safety of miners. Additionally, we apply the exponential smoothing algorithm for predictive analysis, using 2002 data points of CO concentration variations. The predictive results align closely with the original data trends, making it a valuable reference model for ensuring miner safety.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the emerging field of wearable devices, "E-Visual", designed for emotion visualization. These wearable devices, such as fitness trackers, smartwatches, and biometric sensors, can potentially provide valuable information about a person's emotional state. These devices analyze physiological signals such as heart rate, skin conductance, and facial expressions to detect and track emotional arousal and valence changes. The article reviews the current state of the art in wearable emotion visualization technology, including the types of sensors and algorithms used and the potential benefits and applications of this technology. This paper also explores the challenges and limitations of using wearables for emotion visualization, such as the need for reliable sensing and privacy concerns. The article argues that wearable devices for emotion visualization could revolutionize our understanding and handling of our emotions, enhancing mental health and overall well-being.},

abstract = {Technology in this millennium has evolved to become a conduit for communication, creative expression and knowledge transmission. Central to this is the designer's agentic role in mediating the percolation of the digital into the built environment to produce new and transformative experiences incorporating mixed reality. Through discussing two speculative projects, this paper poses the question of what instigative role media might play in efforts to boost spatial ambience and social agency. The first reimagines an AR media architecture experience: by expanding the scope of screen media to include touch media and mobile media, handheld devices fulfil a fresh function, to re-center the urban experience alongside encouraging multidimensional user interaction. Meanwhile, a virtually mediated tour conceived to explore interactions between media and architecture, user agency and behavior, redefines an appreciation for the mimetic. While VR is unable to replicate the randomness and complexity of real-world experience, the sensorial richness of the lived environment and in-person interactions, insights can still be gleaned by how people navigate in cities, even in a simulated environment. These examples reconfirm how our relationship with urban space has been irrevocably altered by digital affordance, through interpretation, interactions and interventions. They open up a dialogue on other alternatives to traditional notions and practices of media architecture. Given the proliferation of digital and online tools and platforms, it stands to reason that now is the opportune time to enskill and empower designers to seize control of the technological ensemble, and exploit what the digital affords, to interpret new and meaningful uses.},

abstract = {With the improvement of material living standards, people have more expectations and requirements for a healthy life. Health management and artificial intelligence have become the sunrise industries in the field of health. Intelligent wearable and telemedicine have been widely applied and popularized. This design is based on wireless motion sensor nodes such as ADS1292, STM32 chips, MPU6050 motion sensors, and Bluetooth modules. The system collects the signals required for heart rate calculation through ADS1292 chips, and the signals are denoised by filter software designed by the microcontroller program to remove baseline drift and EMG signal interference. Then, an algorithm program is used to determine the peak value of the R wave to calculate the R wave period, draw an electrocardiogram, and calculate the instantaneous heart rate. Through simulation and actual measurement demonstration on the application platform, performance analysis was conducted on the display results, further improving the design scheme of the human heart rate and body temperature monitoring system. Based on this, software and hardware system design was completed, and a real-time heart rate motion state detection device was developed to achieve the goal of spreading heart rate data and detecting the corresponding reasonable heart rate range according to individual situations.},

abstract = {Cosmetics contain delicate chemical compositions vulnerable to damage from temperature fluctuations. Precise temperature control is therefore critical for maintaining product integrity during storage and transport. Microcontroller-based systems present a cost-effective and customizable solution for regulating cosmetics storage environments. This paper details the development of an AT89C51 microcontroller-based temperature control system for a cosmetics insulation box aimed at stabilizing internal conditions. The proposed system integrates a DS18B20 digital sensor for temperature acquisition, an LCD1602 display for visualization, and bespoke control circuits for adjustment. Dedicated hardware and software designs enable the system to operate in four functional states: normal temperature regulation, high/low temperature alarms, and manual threshold configuration. Rigorous testing was conducted through Proteus simulation, successfully verifying the system's ability to accurately measure temperature and trigger alarms when outside defined limits. The microcontroller approach enables robust, adaptable temperature control to protect delicate cosmetics and other temperature-sensitive goods like pharmaceuticals. With further development, this customizable platform has potential for broader applicability across industries requiring careful stabilization of storage environments.},
