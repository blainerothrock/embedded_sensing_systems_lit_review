EX.1: High-power and/or high-dimensional data processing 
  - example: real time processing of image, video, audio or RF analysis. Unless specifically position as low-power 
  - roughly requiring >=500mW peak power consumption (estimate)
  - macroprocessor-based (e.g., raspberry-pi) 
EX.2: Commercial off the shelf (COTS) use or repurpose
  - example: use of smartphones, smartwatches, commercial devices sensors for new applications
EX.3: Out-of-scope platform or applications
  - outside of medical or ecological domain
  - positioned for general population (e.g., consumer product)
  - examples: vehicles, UAVs, drones, games/toys, remote-sensing, VR/AR, entertainment, or general-purpose tech
EX.5: Application-agnostic
  - works contains no targeted field application or positioned as a wide-range application
  - example: novel wireless protocol, security enhancement to general wireless electronics
EX.6: No specific embedded artifact
  - work must describe or evaluate a system built/designed by the authors.
  - examples: public dataset analysis (even if data is wireless embedded systems), simulation
