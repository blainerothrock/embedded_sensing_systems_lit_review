abstract = {The battery-less Internet of Things (IoT) devices are a key element in the sustainable green initiative for the next-generation wireless networks. These battery-free devices use the ambient energy, harvested from the environment. The energy harvesting environment is dynamic and causes intermittent task execution. The harvested energy is stored in small capacitors and it is challenging to assure the application task execution. The main goal is to provide a mechanism to aggregate the sensor data and provide a sustainable application support in the distributed battery-less IoT network. We model the distributed IoT network system consisting of many battery-free IoT sensor hardware modules and heterogeneous IoT applications that are being supported in the device-edge-cloud continuum. The applications require sensor data from a distributed set of battery-less hardware modules and there is provision of joint control over the module actuators. We propose an application-aware task and energy manager (ATEM) for the IoT devices and a vector-synchronization based data aggregator (VSDA). The ATEM is supported by device-level federated energy harvesting and system-level energy-aware heterogeneous application management. In our proposed framework the data aggregator forecasts the available power from the ambient energy harvester using long-short-term-memory (LSTM) model and sets the device profile as well as the application task rates accordingly. Our proposed scheme meets the heterogeneous application requirements with negligible overhead; reduces the data loss and packet delay; increases the hardware component availability; and makes the components available sooner as compared to the state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {These days, mobile/handheld air quality monitoring devices primarily sense pollutants and send them to the cloud without performing intelligent processing, such as soft calibration, sensor fault detection, or any onboard predictions. This paper explores the feasibility of harnessing Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) to develop a compact system for inferring environmental pollution levels at a device’s location. Our primary challenge lies in fitting a trained machine-learning model within the device’s limited memory without compromising its accuracy or inference speed. Building upon the correlation between the Air Quality Index (AQI) and various meteorological factors, we propose a TinyML-based framework that predicts AQI using temperature, humidity, internet-sourced meteorological data, and temporal information collected through a web crawler. Our contributions encompass sensor activation, system design on a Raspberry Pi Pico W board, and hyperparameter tuning of machine learning models, culminating in an efficient XGBoost implementation within the 2MB memory constraint, achieving 75.2\% accuracy with a 1615μs latency. Moreover, an accuracy of 60\% was observed when a real-time validation was carried out. As per our knowledge, this system is the first-of-its-kind device that tries to embed some intelligence into a mobile air quality sensing device.},

abstract = {Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measures the variation of the time between consecutive heartbeats and is a major indicator of physical and mental health. Recent research has demonstrated that photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors can be used to infer HRV. However, many prior studies had high errors because they only employed signal processing or machine learning (ML), or because they indirectly inferred HRV, or because there lacks large training datasets. Many prior studies may also require large ML models. The low accuracy and large model sizes limit their applications to small embedded devices and potential future use in healthcare.To address the above issues, we first collected a large dataset of PPG signals and HRV ground truth. With this dataset, we developed HRV models that combine signal processing and ML to directly infer HRV. Evaluation results show that our method had errors between 3.5\% to 25.7\% and outperformed signal-processing-only and ML-only methods. We also explored different ML models, which showed that Decision Trees and Multi-level Perceptrons have 13.0\% and 9.1\% errors on average with models at most hundreds of KB and inference time less than 1ms. Hence, they are more suitable for small embedded devices and potentially enable the future use of PPG-based HRV monitoring in healthcare.},

abstract = {The management and control of heterogeneous IoT devices in cyber-physical systems (CPS) involves ensuring authorized access to cloud-stored data, including instructions, commands, and configuration settings, and issuing them securely to IoT devices for remote execution. Existing access management techniques present various security challenges in ensuring fine-grained access control to sensitive data present on untrusted cloud servers. These challenges are further complicated by the need to dynamically evaluate contextual parameters linked to IoT devices before issuing instructions. This work proposes a secure and context-aware encryption technique for remote access control of IoT devices. Leveraging ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE), the scheme encrypts instructions, requiring the user’s decryption key to satisfy embedded access policies for access. The integration of access policies considers both user attributes and dynamic parameters associated with IoT devices, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation before access is granted. To verify the dynamic parameters, fog-based servers are employed, positioned in proximity to IoT devices for efficient and real-time assessment. The scheme introduces a two-phase decryption process, involving fog servers in generating key components based on the verified dynamic parameters (of IoT devices) that are combined with the user’s existing key to ensure secure partial decryption. Final decryption is performed by the user who securely sends instructions for execution on the IoT devices. Our proposed cryptosystem security and computational complexity analysis demonstrate the scheme’s effectiveness in achieving secure and context-aware IoT device access in dynamic CPS environments, ensuring efficient control, monitoring, and automation while preserving data privacy.},

abstract = {The growing demand for Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) sensors within the healthcare sector has emphasized the necessity for robust security measures. However, these devices, often constrained by limited resources, frequently require external assistance to guarantee the security of data. Blockchain technology emerges as a practical solution, offering a way to enhance system security and safeguard patients' sensitive health records against unauthorized access and data breaches. The fusion of IoMT and blockchain presents a range of benefits, such as cost reduction, improved speed, automation, and the guarantee of unmodifiable data. Nevertheless, security concerns persist, particularly in light of the ever-evolving encryption techniques. The effective implementation of IoMT hinges on the delivery of personalized, patient-centered care, which has the potential to enhance affordability, simplicity, and overall convenience, ultimately contributing to improved quality of life and extended lifespans. In this comprehensive exploration, we delve into the historical context, architecture, components, and challenges associated with IoMT. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth examination of blockchain technology, covering its essential elements and categories, as well as its seamless integration into IoMT, underscoring its critical role in reinforcing security measures within the healthcare domain. Furthermore, this paper outlines recent developments in blockchain technology within the IoMT framework, highlighting its ongoing evolution and sustained significance in the healthcare field.},

abstract = {Emergency Medical Services (EMS) is an important domain of healthcare. First responders save millions of lives per year. Machine learning and sensing technologies are actively being developed to support first responders in their EMS activities. However, there are significant challenges to overcome in developing these new solutions. One of the main challenges is the limitations of existing methods for EMS text mining, and developing a highly accurate language model for the EMS domain. Several important Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT) models for medical domains, i.e., BioBERT and ClinicalBERT, have significantly influenced biomedical text mining tasks. But extracting information from the EMS domain is a separate challenge due to the uniqueness of the EMS domain, and the significant scarcity of a high-quality EMS corpus. In this research, we propose EMS-BERT - a BERT model specifically developed for EMS text-mining tasks. For data augmentation on our small, classified EMS corpus which consists of nearly 2.4M words, we use a simultaneous pre-training method for transfer-learning relevant information from medical, bio-medical, and clinical domains; and train a high-performance BERT model. Our thorough evaluation shows at least 2\% to as much as 11\% improvement of F-1 scores for EMS-BERT on different classification tasks, i.e., entity recognition, relation extraction, and inferring missing information when compared both with existing state-of-the-art clinical entity recognition tools, and with various medical BERT models.},

abstract = {Most existing sensor-based monitoring frameworks presume that a large available labeled dataset is processed to train accurate detection models. However, in settings where personalization is necessary at deployment time to fine-tune the model, a person-specific dataset needs to be collected online by interacting with the users. Optimizing the collection of labels in such phase is instrumental to impose a tolerable burden on the users while maximizing personal improvement. In this paper, we consider a fine-grain stress detection problem based on wearable sensors targeting everyday settings, and propose a novel context-aware active learning strategy capable of jointly maximizing the meaningfulness of the signal samples we request the user to label and the response rate. We develop a multilayered sensor-edge-cloud platform to periodically capture physiological signals and process them in real-time, as well as to collect labels and retrain the detection model. We collect a large dataset and show that the context-aware active learning technique we propose achieves a desirable detection performance using 88\% and 32\% fewer queries from users compared to a randomized strategy and a traditional active learning strategy, respectively.},

abstract = {Recently, Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS) are widely used in healthcare to enhance the quality of healthcare through continuous monitoring and treatment. MCPS integrates a collection of medical devices that store sensitive medical data from hospitals and patients. In various healthcare applications, such as early disease detection and prediction, MCPS collaboratively work to train a single model. However, in such scenarios, maintaining data privacy among collaborating parties is challenging. To address this issue, some researchers have proposed federated learning for MCPS, enabling collaborators to train a single model by sharing model parameters without disclosing the original data. In this paper, we propose a hybrid federated learning approach to train MCPS, to achieve higher accuracy using different combinations of machine learning techniques. Our proposed method ensures improved security and accuracy for MCPS in comparison to existing methods. We have evaluated the performance and security of our approach with state-of-the-art models.},

Sensors on a patient outfitted with various sensors can read physiological data. This work uses two types of queries such as strict and flexible queries. Strict inquiries are used when an emergency is recognised due to a patient’s criticality. Non-emergency queries are referred to as flexible inquiry. The strict queries are executed at a nearby edge node, and the data is sent to the fog node via a switch or SDN controller. Instead, a patient can move for treatment depending on the proximity of medical professionals, the quality of the facilities, and the travel time. The task of determining availability falls to a Local Medical Team (LMT). It is also the responsibility of a Global Medical Team (GMT) to keep track of the patient’s health and provide the LMT with any information that is required. We can observe from the outcomes that the suggested algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithms.},

abstract = {People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) have multiple symptoms, such as freezing of gait (FoG), hand tremors, speech difficulties, and balance issues, in different stages of the disease. Among these symptoms, hand tremors are present across all stages of the disease. PD hand tremors have critical consequences and negatively impact the quality of PD patients' everyday lives. Researchers have proposed a variety of wearable devices to mitigate PD tremors. However, these devices require accurate tremor detection technology to work effectively while the tremor occurs. This paper introduces a PD action tremor detection method to recognize PD tremors from regular activities. We used a dataset from 30 PD patients wearing accelerometers and gyroscope sensors on their wrists. We selected time-domain and frequency-domain hand-crafted features. Also, we compared our hand-crafted features with existing CNN data-driven features, and our features have more specific boundaries in 2-D feature visualization using the t-SNE tool. We fed our features into multiple supervised machine learning models, including Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for detecting PD action tremors. These models were evaluated with 30 PD patients' data. The performance of all models using our features has more than 90\% of F1 scores in five-fold cross-validations and 88\% F1 scores in the leave-one-out evaluation. Specifically, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) perform the best in five-fold cross-validation with over 92\% F1 scores. SVMs also show the best performance in the leave-one-out evaluation with over 90\% F1 scores.},

abstract = {Edge intelligence has emerged as a promising paradigm to accelerate DNN inference by model partitioning, which is particularly useful for intelligent scenarios that demand high accuracy and low latency. However, the dynamic nature of the edge environment and the diversity of end devices pose a significant challenge for DNN model partitioning strategies. Meanwhile, limited resources of the edge server make it difficult to manage resource allocation efficiently among multiple devices. In addition, most of the existing studies disregard the different service requirements of the DNN inference tasks, such as its high accuracy-sensitive or high latency-sensitive. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Compression Scale DNN Inference Acceleration (MCIA) based on cloud-edge-end collaboration. We model this problem as a mixed-integer multi-dimensional optimization problem, jointly optimizing the DNN model version choice, the partitioning choice, and the allocation of computational and bandwidth resources to maximize the tradeoff between inference accuracy and latency depending on the property of the tasks. Initially, we train multiple versions of DNN inference models with different compression scales in the cloud, and deploy them to end devices and edge server. Next, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm is developed for joint decision making of adaptive collaborative inference and resource allocation based on the current multi-compression scale models and the task property. Experimental results show that MCIA can adapt to heterogeneous devices and dynamic networks, and has superior performance compared with other methods.},

abstract = {According to the survey, the incidence rate of myopia and long-term poor sitting posture among young people lead to a rapid rise in the phenomenon of stooping. Based on this, a multifunctional intelligent desk lamp based on STM32 has been designed,The hardware system can be divided into two parts: the main body of the desk lamp and the low head detection grating on both sides. The main peripheral circuits include a light sensor circuit, button input ADC, Bluetooth circuit, audio circuit, battery residual voltage detection circuit, battery charging state detection, serial port debugging circuit, thermal infrared human body detection circuit, SW download interface, white and warm light PWM adjustment, temperature and humidity detection, OLED display IIC interface circuit, NRF wireless communication circuit Power circuit, etc., and corresponding programs for STM32 and WeChat mini programs were designed. The debugging results indicate that the temperature and humidity module continuously collects the temperature and humidity of the surrounding environment and automatically adjusts the color temperature of the light. The photosensitive sensor collects the light intensity of the surrounding environment, thereby automatically adjusting the brightness of the light. The human body sensor detects that there is no one around the desk lamp, and if there is no one around, the lamp will automatically turn off. The four buttons include switch buttons for mode selection, low head detection gear selection, white light brightness selection, and warm light brightness selection. Set four levels of low head detection alarm thresholds, namely 20cm, 25cm, 30cm, and 35cm. When a person's head falls below the selected alarm threshold, the desk lamp emits a voice reminder. If the person still lowers their head after the set time, the lamp will automatically turn off. The OLED screen displays the current mode, brightness value, temperature, humidity, and time information of the desk lamp. After connecting to Bluetooth, the mobile WeChat mini program synchronously displays and adjusts data such as brightness, color temperature, desk lamp mode, and ambient temperature and humidity. This intelligent desk lamp can provide users with a suitable brightness and color temperature, and is a multifunctional intelligent desk lamp for correcting improper sitting posture.},

abstract = {Multimedia Internet of Things (MIoT) is widely explored in many smart applications for connectivity with wireless communication. Such networks are not like ordinary networks because it has to collect a massive amount of data and are further forwarded to processing systems. As MIoT is very limited in terms of resources for healthcare, smart homes, etc., therefore, energy efficiency with reliable data transmission is a significant research challenge. As smart applications rely on bounded constraints, therefore duplicate and unnecessary data transmission should be minimized. In addition, the timely delivery of data in crucial circumstances has a significant impact on any proposed system. Consequently, this paper presents a fuzzy logic-based edge computing framework to provide cooperative decision-making while avoiding inefficient use of the sensing power of smart devices. The proposed framework can be applied to critical applications to improve response time and processing cost. It consists of the following two functional components: Firstly, it provides the automated routing process with a natural language interface at the sink node. Secondly, to ensure reasonable performance, it also transmits semantic data between sensors using fuzzy queries and security. According to the performance evaluation, the proposed framework significantly outperformed related studies in terms of energy consumption, packet overhead, network throughput, and end-to-end delay.},

abstract = {For a growing economy like India, most of its energy resources are obtained through extractive processes such as mining of coal and other minerals. Mining can however have many negative social and ecological impacts if it is not well regulated. Illegal mining or inadequate reclamation of abandoned mines can amplify these impacts, emphasizing the need to develop methods that can monitor changes in the land-use patterns in and around mining sites. We develop a method using machine learning on freely available satellite data to monitor the extent of mines, and augment it with outputs from land use and land cover classification, deforestation detection, and PM2.5 particulate matter estimation from remote sensing data to track land-use and ecological changes taking place in the proximity of mining sites. We provide evaluation results of our mining delineation classifier, a feasibility check of this suite of tools to monitor mining areas over a period of four years, and a temporal characterization study over 628 mines in India that were granted a clearance for operations during the period 2006 to 2012. We further use this suite of monitoring tools to compare socio-economic development and health indicators across mining and non-mining areas, across various states in India, to study whether extractive processes of mining benefit the immediate population in their neighbourhood.},

Digital communication tools, however, hold great potential for facilitating rich encounters with cultural heritage and in particular with the immaterial aspects of museum collections and their histories. In this article, we present our design steps and choices, aiming at subtly and seamlessly adding a digital dimension to a historic house. Based on qualitative interviews, we evaluate how the sound installation at Bakkehuset is sensed, interpreted, and used by visitors as part of their museum experience.

abstract = {Body temperature is an important vital sign which can indicate fever and is known to be correlated with activities such as eating, exercise and stress. However, continuous temperature monitoring poses a significant challenge. We present Thermal Earring, a first-of-its-kind smart earring that enables a reliable wearable solution for continuous temperature monitoring. The Thermal Earring takes advantage of the unique position of earrings in proximity to the head, a region with tight coupling to the body unlike watches and other wearables which are more loosely worn on extremities. We develop a hardware prototype in the form factor of real earrings measuring a maximum width of 11.3 mm and a length of 31 mm, weighing 335 mg, and consuming only 14.4 uW which enables a battery life of 28 days in real-world tests. We demonstrate this form factor is small and light enough to integrate into real jewelry with fashionable designs. Additionally, we develop a dual sensor design to differentiate human body temperature change from environmental changes. We explore the use of this novel sensing platform and find its measured earlobe temperatures are stable within ±0.32 °C during periods of rest. Using these promising results, we investigate its capability of detecting fever by gathering data from 5 febrile patients and 20 healthy participants. Further, we perform the first-ever investigation of the relationship between earlobe temperature and a variety of daily activities, demonstrating earlobe temperature changes related to eating and exercise. We also find the surprising result that acute stressors such as public speaking and exams cause measurable changes in earlobe temperature. We perform multi-day in-the-wild experiments and confirm the temperature changes caused by these daily activities in natural daily scenarios. This initial exploration seeks to provide a foundation for future automatic activity detection and earring-based wearables.},

Soil Microbial Fuel Cells (SMFCs) offer promise as a renewable energy source that is biocompatible and viable in difficult environments where traditional batteries and solar panels fall short. However, SMFC development is in its infancy, and challenges like robustness to environmental factors and low power output stymie efforts to implement real-world applications in terrestrial environments. This work details a 2-year iterative process that uncovers barriers to practical SMFC design for powering electronics, which we address through a mechanistic understanding of SMFC theory from the literature. We present nine months of deployment data gathered from four SMFC experiments exploring cell geometries, resulting in an improved SMFC that generates power across a wider soil moisture range. From these experiments, we extracted key lessons and a testing framework, assessed SMFC's field performance, contextualized improvements with emerging and existing computing systems, and demonstrated the improved SMFC powering a wireless sensor for soil moisture and touch sensing. We contribute our data, methodology, and designs to establish the foundation for a sustainable, soil-powered future.},

In this paper, we are interested in using COTS WiFi devices to identify material details, including location, material type, and shape, of stationary objects in the surrounding environment, which may open up new opportunities for many applications. Specifically, we present Wi-Painter, a model-driven system that can accurately detects smooth-surfaced material types and their edges using COTS WiFi devices without modification. Different from previous arts for material identification, Wi-Painter subdivides the target into individual 2D pixels, and simultaneously forms a 2D image based on identifying the material type of each pixel. The key idea of Wi-Painter is to exploit the complex permittivity of the object surface which can be estimated by the different reflectivity of signals with different polarization directions. In particular, we construct the multi-incident angle model to characterize the material, using only the power ratios of the vertically and horizontally polarized signals measured at several different incident angles, which avoids the use of inaccurate WiFi signal phases. We implement and evaluate Wi-Painter in the real world, showing an average classification accuracy of 93.4\% for different material types including metal, wood, rubber and plastic of different sizes and thicknesses, and across different environments. In addition, Wi-Painter can accurately detect the material type and edge of the word "LOVE" spliced with different materials, with an average size of 60cm \texttimes{} 80cm, and material edges with different orientations.},

abstract = {Earables (in-ear wearables) are gaining increasing attention for sensing applications and healthcare research thanks to their ergonomy and non-invasive nature. However, air leakages between the device and the user's ear, resulting from daily activities or wearing variabilities, can decrease the performance of applications, interfere with calibrations, and reduce the robustness of the overall system. Existing literature lacks established methods for estimating the degree of air leaks (i.e., seal integrity) to provide information for the earable applications. In this work, we proposed a novel unobtrusive method for estimating the air leakage level of earbuds based on an in-ear microphone. The proposed method aims to estimate the magnitude of distortions, reflections, and external noise in the ear canal while excluding the speaker output by learning the speaker-to-microphone transfer function which allows us to perform the task unobtrusively. Using the obtained residual signal in the ear canal, we extract three features and deploy a machine-learning model for estimating the air leakage level. We investigated our system under various conditions to validate its robustness and resilience against the motion and other artefacts. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method can track air leakage levels under different daily activities."The best computer is a quiet, invisible servant."~Mark Weiser},

abstract = {Wearable sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) has gained significant attention due to the widespread use of smart wearable devices. However, variations in different subjects can cause a domain shift that impedes the scaling of the recognition model. Unsupervised domain adaptation has been proposed as a solution to recognize activities in new, unlabeled target domains by training the source and target data together. However, the need for accessing source data raises privacy concerns. Source-free domain adaptation has emerged as a practical setting, where only a pre-trained source model is provided for the unlabeled target domain. This setup aligns with the need for personalized activity model adaptation on target local devices. As the edge devices are resource-constrained with limited memory, it is crucial to take the computational efficiency, i.e., memory cost into consideration. In this paper, we develop a source-free domain adaptation framework for wearable sensor-based HAR, with a focus on computational efficiency for target edge devices. Firstly, we design a lightweight add-on module called adapter to adapt the frozen pre-trained model to the unlabeled target domain. Secondly, to optimize the adapter, we adopt a simple yet effective model adaptation method that leverages local representation similarity and prediction consistency. Additionally, we design a set of sample selection optimization strategies to select samples effective for adaptation and further enhance computational efficiency while maintaining adaptation performance. Our extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our method achieves comparable recognition accuracy to the state-of-the-art source free domain adaptation methods with fewer than 1\% of the parameters updated and saves up to 4.99X memory cost.},

abstract = {In recent years, considerable endeavors have been devoted to exploring Wi-Fi-based sensing technologies by modeling the intricate mapping between received signals and corresponding human activities. However, the inherent complexity of Wi-Fi signals poses significant challenges for practical applications due to their pronounced susceptibility to deployment environments. To address this challenge, we delve into the distinctive characteristics of Wi-Fi signals and distill three pivotal factors that can be leveraged to enhance generalization capabilities of deep learning-based Wi-Fi sensing models: 1) effectively capture valuable input to mitigate the adverse impact of noisy measurements; 2) adaptively fuse complementary information from multiple Wi-Fi devices to boost the distinguishability of signal patterns associated with different activities; 3) extract generalizable features that can overcome the inconsistent representations of activities under different environmental conditions (e.g., locations, orientations). Leveraging these insights, we design a novel and unified sensing framework based on Wi-Fi signals, dubbed UniFi, and use gesture recognition as an application to demonstrate its effectiveness. UniFi achieves robust and generalizable gesture recognition in real-world scenarios by extracting discriminative and consistent features unrelated to environmental factors from pre-denoised signals collected by multiple transceivers. To achieve this, we first introduce an effective signal preprocessing approach that captures the applicable input data from noisy received signals for the deep learning model. Second, we propose a multi-view deep network based on spatio-temporal cross-view attention that integrates multi-carrier and multi-device signals to extract distinguishable information. Finally, we present the mutual information maximization as a regularizer to learn environment-invariant representations via contrastive loss without requiring access to any signals from unseen environments for practical adaptation. Extensive experiments on the Widar 3.0 dataset demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in different settings (99\% and 90\%-98\% accuracy for in-domain and cross-domain recognition without additional data collection and model training).},

In healthcare contexts such as nursing homes, it is crucial to employ plausible and non-invasive methods for human mesh reconstruction that preserve privacy and dignity. Traditional vision-based techniques encounter challenges related to occlusion, viewpoint limitations, lighting conditions, and privacy concerns. In this research, we present CAvatar, a real-time human mesh reconstruction approach that innovatively utilizes pressure maps recorded by a tactile carpet as input. This advanced, non-intrusive technology obviates the need for cameras during usage, thereby safeguarding privacy. Our approach addresses several challenges, such as the limited spatial resolution of tactile sensors, extracting meaningful information from noisy pressure maps, and accommodating user variations and multiple users. We have developed an attention-based deep learning network, complemented by a discriminator network, to predict 3D human pose and shape from 2D pressure maps with notable accuracy. Our model demonstrates promising results, with a mean per joint position error (MPJPE) of 5.89 cm and a per vertex error (PVE) of 6.88 cm. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to generate 3D mesh of human activities solely using tactile carpet signals, offering a novel approach that addresses privacy concerns and surpasses the limitations of existing vision-based and wearable solutions.

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed an increasing prevalence of wearable devices in the public, where atrial fibrillation (AF) detection is a popular application in these devices. Generally, AF detection is performed on cloud whereas this paper describes an on-device AF detection method. Technically, compressed sensing (CS) is first used for electrocardiograph (ECG) acquisition. Then QRS detection is proposed to be performed directly on the compressed CS measurements, rather than on the reconstructed signals on the powerful cloud server. Based on the extracted QRS information, AF is determined by quantitatively analyzing the (RR, dRR) plot. Databases with ECG samples collected from both medical-level (MIT-BIH afdb) and wearable ECG devices (Physionet Challenge 2017) are introduced for performance validation. The experiment results well demonstrate that our on-device AF detection algorithm can approach the performance of those implemented on the raw signals. Our proposal is suitable for AF screening directly on the wearable devices, without the support of the data center for signal reconstruction and intelligent analysis.},

abstract = {ICPS software and hardware suffer from low update frequency, making it easier for insiders to bypass external defenses and launch concealed destructive attacks. To address these concerns, we design a device fingerprinting method based on multi-physical features, augmenting current intrusion detection techniques in the ICPS environment. In this article, we use the sorting system as an example, demonstrating that the proposed device fingerprinting technology has generality in the intrusion detection of ICPS control flow. Specifically, we first formalize the physical model of the sorting system to analyze the critical device features. Then, we extract these physical features from the sensor data collected in a physical testbed. Utilizing featurized data, we train a classifier that generates fingerprints in real-time in the production environment. Moreover, we develop a differential detection model based on device fingerprints to discover stealthy insider attacks efficiently. We evaluate the proposed method in a real-world testbed. Experiment results show that the detecting performance of classifiers approaches 100\% when the the number of component types is small.},

abstract = {Trees have emerged as the most popular choice of intrinsically interpretable models to represent policies in reinforcement learning. However, directly learning a tree policy poses challenges, prompting existing approaches to employ neural network policies to generate datasets for training tree-based models in a supervised manner. Nonetheless, these approaches assume that the action suggested by the neural network policy represents the sole optimal action, with all other actions being equally sub-optimal. This work presents a novel perspective by associating different costs with the prediction of different actions. By adopting a cost-sensitive approach to tree construction, we demonstrate that policies generated using this methodology exhibit improved performance. To validate our findings, we develop cost-sensitive variants of two established methods, VIPER and MoET, and provide empirical evidence showcasing their superiority over the original methods across diverse environments.},

Due to the availability of various wearable devices on the market, we can easily access sensor data for human action recognition. However, it is still a challenge to capture minute action processes as well as extract spatio-temporal motion patterns from serial sensor data. Therefore, we propose a novel hierarchical multi-scale adaptive Conv-LSTM network structure called HMA Conv-LSTM. The finer-grained spatial information in the sensor signals is extracted by hierarchical multi-scale convolution. The multi-channel feature fusion through adaptive channel feature fusion retains important information and improves model efficiency. We capture temporal context information by dynamic channel selection-LSTM based on the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on the Opportunity and PAMAP2 public datasets show that our proposed model achieves competitive performance compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {Quadruped robots have strong adaptability to extreme environments but may also experience faults. Once these faults occur, robots must be repaired before returning to the task, reducing their practical feasibility. One prevalent concern among these faults is actuator degradation, stemming from factors like device aging or unexpected operational events. Traditionally, addressing this problem has relied heavily on intricate fault-tolerant design, which demands deep domain expertise from developers and lacks generalizability. Learning-based approaches offer effective ways to mitigate these limitations, but a research gap exists in effectively deploying such methods on real-world quadruped robots. This paper introduces a pioneering teacher-student framework rooted in reinforcement learning, named Actuator Degeneration Adaptation Transformer (Adapt), aimed at addressing this research gap. This framework produces a unified control strategy, enabling the robot to sustain its locomotion and perform tasks despite sudden joint actuator faults, relying exclusively on its internal sensors. Empirical evaluations on the Unitree A1 platform validate the deployability and effectiveness of Adapt on real-world quadruped robots, and affirm the robustness and practicality of our approach.},

abstract = {Wheeled robots have gained significant attention due to their wide range of applications in manufacturing, logistics, and service industries. However, due to the difficulty of building a highly accurate dynamics model for wheeled robots, developing and testing control algorithms for them remains challenging and time-consuming, requiring extensive physical experimentation. To address this problem, we propose D4W, i.e., Dependable Data-Driven Dynamics for Wheeled Robots, a simulation framework incorporating data-driven methods to accelerate the development and evaluation of algorithms for wheeled robots. The key contribution of D4W is a solution that utilizes real-world sensor data to learn accurate models of robot dynamics. The learned dynamics can capture complex robot behaviors and interactions with the environment throughout simulations, surpassing the limitations of analytical methods, which only work in simplified scenarios. Experimental results show that D4W achieves the best simulation accuracy compared to traditional approaches, allowing for rapid iteration of wheel robot algorithms with less or no need for fine-tuning in reality. We further verify the usability and practicality of the proposed framework through integration with existing simulators and controllers.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI), their applications between the human brain and external devices is becoming more common, but with this comes the exposure of the existence of privacy protection issues. EEG signals contain sensitive information about an individual's thoughts, emotions, and health status, and there is a security risk of leakage or tampering when they are transmitted over open networks. To prevent the illegal acquisition and misuse of EEG signals, an EEG signal encryption scheme that combines the hyperchaotic system and identity authentication is proposed. First, a partial key is generated by hashing algorithm on the basis of identity and EEG signals. Then, the hyperchaotic system uses it as an initial value to generate a chaotic sequence. Finally, the generated random sequence is utilized for confusion and diffusion operations to achieve encryption of EEG signals. The experimental results show that the encryption scheme has high security, strong key sensitivity and anti-attack capability.},

abstract = {Indonesia is one of the world's largest palm oil producers. The area of oil palm plantations in Indonesia is increasing every year. However, large-scale land clearing for oil palm plantations is considered a cause of deforestation, negatively impacting the environment and society. Therefore, it is necessary to manage plantations sustainably, preserving forests and biodiversity. One solution to this problem is applying remote sensing technology that remotely monitors the ages and health levels of trees in oil palm plantations. In this fashion, trees detected as unproductive can be immediately replaced with new ones without having to clear new land again. There are three approaches to remote tree detection from previous studies: classical digital image processing, classical machine learning, and deep learning. Deep learning is an approach that is currently widely applied to object detection because of its accuracy and speed. This study proposes a deep-learning-based approach to detect oil palm trees by remote sensing using the RGB feature. This research consists of several stages: data collection, bounding box annotation, train/test split, model training, and evaluation. The data were acquired from an oil palm plantation in Kalimantan, Indonesia. The object-detection-based deep learning method was YOLO Version 5 (YOLO-V5). In this study, we compared all YOLO-V5 network models, namely, YOLO-V5s (small), YOLO-V5m (medium), YOLO-V5l (large), and YOLO-V5x (extra-large). The oil palm tree detection model with the highest evaluation metric used YOLO-V5s (YOLO-V5 small network) with a batch size of 32, i.e., the values of mAP50, mAP@[0.5, 0.95], and F1-Score respectively were 0.851, 0.457, and 0.785. This is preliminary research that is expected to continue to be developed so that it becomes a robust model for detecting oil palm trees in Indonesia and can be implemented in real-time on GIS software and drones.},

abstract = {In the context of edge computing, a cluster of small single-board computers like Raspberry Pi could serve as robust servers. These clusters not only offer robust server capabilities but also exhibit a remarkable versatility in handling incoming data streams from a multitude of sensors within the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, particularly in underserved rural areas. Simultaneously, they can seamlessly double up as servers for web-based applications tailored to the specific requirements of small businesses. However, the operational context of such an edge computing cluster can present challenges. For instance, dynamic load fluctuations, ranging from high to low demands, may lead to performance service degradation or underutilized services. This is a typical problem in distributed computing environments, where the heterogeneity of devices, dynamic conditions, and reliability of connections can create scalability issues. This paper addresses these challenges through a selective set of integrated software suites aiming to autoscale an edge computing cluster. The software suites consist of a lightweight Kubernetes distribution called K3s, with an automation framework executed through Ansible. Rigorous testing, primarily focused on web-based applications, has showcased the efficacy of this approach. A compelling comparison has been drawn between this optimized edge computing setup and conventional desktop-based servers, emphasizing superior power efficiency and commendable performance levels. The service scaling can reduce power consumption by up to 45\%.},

abstract = {The classification of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals plays a crucial role in monitoring and diagnosing cardiac conditions. With the advancements in wearable sensor technology, ECG signals can now be acquired conveniently in real-time using portable devices such as Raspberry Pi. However, the efficient extraction and selection of classification features from ECG signals remain a challenging task. In this study, we present a comparative analysis of classification features for automated ECG signal classification on Raspberry Pi. We evaluate and compare various feature extraction techniques, such as PQRS morphology, RR Interval, and wavelet. The performance of these features is assessed using a machine-learning algorithm random forest. To conduct the experiments, we use proven ECG signal data from MIT BIH arrhythmia, feature extraction techniques were applied to the preprocessed data to derive informative features for classification. The extracted features were used to train and test the machine-learning models. Furthermore, the classifier models were used to predict heartbeats types from wearable sensor data in real time and continuously. The results of our comparative analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and suitability of different feature extraction methods for ECG signal classification on the resource-constrained Raspberry Pi platform. We identify the most discriminative features and evaluate their impact on classification performance. Moreover, we explore the trade-offs between computational complexity and classification accuracy. We discuss the advantages and limitations of each feature extraction technique and provide insights into the feasibility of implementing real-time ECG signal classification systems on wearable devices. Overall, this study contributes to the field of ECG signal analysis by providing a comprehensive comparative analysis of classification features for ECG signal classification on the Raspberry Pi platform. The results and insights obtained from this research can guide the development of efficient and accurate wearable-based ECG monitoring systems for timely diagnosis and intervention in cardiac healthcare applications.},

Resolving the FQNs of these non-FQN types and undeclared receiving objects (referred to as type inference) is the prerequisite to effective search and reuse of partial code. Existing dictionary-lookup based methods build a symbolic knowledge base of API names and code contexts, which involve significant compilation overhead and are sensitive to unseen API names and code context variations. In this article, we propose using a prompt-tuned code masked language model (MLM) as a neural knowledge base for type inference, called POME, which is lightweight and has minimal requirements on code compilation. Unlike the existing symbol name and context matching for type inference, POME infers the FQNs syntax and usage knowledge encapsulated in prompt-tuned code MLM through a colze-style fill-in-blank strategy. POME is integrated as a plug-in into web and integrated development environments (IDE) to assist developers in inferring FQNs in the real world. We systematically evaluate POME on a large amount of source code from GitHub and Stack Overflow, and explore its generalization and hybrid capability. The results validate the effectiveness of the POME design and its applicability for partial code type inference, and they can be easily extended to different programming languages (PL). POME can also be used to generate a PL-hybrid type inference model for providing a one-for-all solution. As the first of its kind, our neural type inference method opens the door to many innovative ways of using partial code.},

abstract = {Light pollution, a brand-new form of pollution in contemporary culture, has had adverse impacts on both people and wildlife. It's time to pay attention to the level of light pollution! In order to better solve those problems in a rational way, a myriad of mathematical methods was applied in this study thoroughly to assess the risk level of light as well as to provide ways for interventions to reduce pollution in various areas.A comprehensive evaluation model based on TOPSIS Model was well developed. The components that contribute to light pollution, which were categorized into the natural factors, human society, and the environmental quality were identified. They were all subdivided into secondary indicators. On the network, data about Chinese cities were gathered and processed. After calculating each index's weight by using Entropy Weight Method, the TOPSIS Model to determine the comprehensive level of each region by the composite score index was applied. A K-means clustering model to divide all outcomes into nine groups while taking the hierarchy of risk levels into account was further utilized. Based on population density and geographical features, Chengdu, Xichong, Yulin, and Gaoli Gong Mountains in China as an urban community were picked for a suburban community, a rural community, and a protected land location, respectively. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the key variables that affected light pollution was also implemented. These three core variables were: daytime duration, number of bird species and residential electricity intensity. The solutions' efficacy by sensitivity analysis was reasonably assessed. For sensitivity analysis, the urban community and suburban community as the research subjects were selected, and Excel to adjust the values to the direction of optimization by 10\%, 20\%, and 30\%, respectively, were used. We finally came to the result: promotion of green buildings is most effective for both regions.Such a myriad of model could be applied to more occasions. This is an innovative and constructive evaluation method, which can be widely used in various evaluation problems in the future and help make contributions to various fields such as environment and humanity.},

Hemiplegia, which is a type of stroke paralysis that is a disruption in the transmission of neural impulses between brain and muscles, has affected an individual's daily routines due to body impairments especially hands. Therefore, a device with active and passive rehabilitation modes for both hands was developed to provide an effective rehabilitation methodology in alleviating their wrist joint pain or any uncomfortableness. It is done with the aid of Arduino UNO, Arduino IDE and MIT App Inventor to control and monitor the motion of the actuator while the prototype is built by using 3D-printing technology. Several methods in obtaining the wrist's angles were done which includes angles obtained from the sensor and measured by the tool. The data collected from sensor and tool are then compared with the desired angle in order to determine the accuracy and consistency of the system. The development of this project is beneficial to those who has been suffering from wrist disability and rather stay home for recovery exercise.},

abstract = {‘‘Extreme edge”1 devices, such as smart sensors, are a uniquely challenging environment for the deployment of machine learning. The tiny energy budgets of these devices lie beyond what is feasible for conventional deep neural networks, particularly in high-throughput scenarios, requiring us to rethink how we approach edge inference. In this work, we propose ULEEN, a model and FPGA-based accelerator architecture based on weightless neural networks (WNNs). WNNs eliminate energy-intensive arithmetic operations, instead using table lookups to perform computation, which makes them theoretically well-suited for edge inference. However, WNNs have historically suffered from poor accuracy and excessive memory usage. ULEEN incorporates algorithmic improvements and a novel training strategy inspired by binary neural networks (BNNs) to make significant strides in addressing these issues. We compare ULEEN against BNNs in software and hardware using the four MLPerf Tiny datasets and MNIST. Our FPGA implementations of ULEEN accomplish classification at 4.0–14.3 million inferences per second, improving area-normalized throughput by an average of 3.6\texttimes{} and steady-state energy efficiency by an average of 7.1\texttimes{} compared to the FPGA-based Xilinx FINN BNN inference platform. While ULEEN is not a universally applicable machine learning model, we demonstrate that it can be an excellent choice for certain applications in energy- and latency-critical edge environments.},

abstract = {Abstract: The electromyogram (EMG), also known as an EMG, is used to assess nerve impulses in motor nerves, sensory nerves, and muscles. EMS is a versatile tool used in various biomedical applications. It is commonly employed to determine physical health, but it also finds utility in evaluating emotional well-being, such as through facial electromyography. Classification of EMG signals has attracted the interest of scientists since it is crucial for identifying neuromuscular disorders (NMDs). Recent advances in the miniaturization of biomedical sensors enable the development of medical monitoring systems. This paper presents a portable and scalable architecture for machine learning modules designed for medical diagnostics. In particular, we provide a hybrid classification model for NMDs. The proposed method combines two supervised machine learning classifiers with the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). During the online testing phase, the class label of an EMG signal is predicted using the classifiers’ optimal models, which can be identified at this stage. The simulation results demonstrate that both classifiers have an accuracy of over 98\%. Finally, the proposed method was implemented using an embedded CompactRIO-9035 real-time controller.},

abstract = {With the increasing adoption of Internet of Things (IoT), research into anomaly detection (AD) in IoT network traffic is gaining importance. Malicious disturbances (e.g. malware and cyber attacks) and operational issues (e.g. software/sensor failures and physical damage) can seriously disrupt network operations. These problems can be detected with traffic monitoring and responded to with mitigation systems. In recent years, machine learning (ML) models have been successfully applied for AD, with state-of-the-art solutions reaching detection rates of . However, the heterogeneity of devices and anomalies in IoT networks poses a challenge for existing solutions. High AD accuracy is usually limited to the types of anomalies present in the training data, falling off significantly in the face of new anomalies. Many IoT-AD solutions are additionally limited to certain types of devices or require additional hardware setup. To tackle these challenges, we present SIURU, a flexible framework for AD research and development capable of applying various feature extraction and ML algorithms. SIURU’s intended deployment environment is broker-based publish-subscribe IoT systems, posing no additional constraints on the IoT device capabilities or network setup. SIURU supports the creation of custom pipelines with data loading, preprocessing, and encoding components, followed by training and testing of ML-based AD models and reporting of prediction results. To validate our proposed framework, we implement the architecture and evaluate its runtime performance. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture by a case example that tests the performance of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) algorithms with multiple ADs and datasets.},

abstract = {Industry 4.0 is increasingly using commodity hardware and software in place of dedicated control systems to lower costs and increase flexibility. However, this means that critical control code must compete for resources with an increasingly complex software stack that exposes a new attack surface. The Mixed Criticality Trusted Execution Environment (Mr-TEE) tackles this problem at its root, by delivering availability for safety-critical control code, while running untrusted applications in a minimally modified Linux stack. This is achieved by providing a real-time scheduler and novel peripheral sharing system in the Secure World. Mr-TEE hence provides the best of both worlds for Industry 4.0 developers, ensuring the trusted execution of time-sensitive control applications, while minimizing design effort and restrictions for untrusted applications. Evaluation on an Arm TrustZone-enabled Cortex MCU demonstrates a worst-case overhead of 1.88\% to support real-time scheduling in the TEE.},

abstract = {A world of healthcare possibilities has been opened with the development of the Internet of Medical Things and related machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence approaches. It has a broad range of uses: when linked to the Internet, common medical equipment and sensors may gather important data; deep learning and artificial intelligence algorithms use this data to understand symptoms and patterns and allow remote healthcare. There are a large number of people affected by thyroid disorders across the world. The ultrasound-based thyroid nodule detection using traditional methods increased the burden on the expertise. Therefore, alternate methods are required to overcome this problem. In order to facilitate early thyroid disorder detection, this research aims to offer an IoT-based ensemble learning framework. In the proposed ensemble model, three pre-trained models DeiT, Mixer-MLP and Swin Transformer, are used for feature extraction. The mRMR technique is used for relevant feature selection. A total of 24 machine learning models have been trained, and weighted average ensemble learning is employed using the Improved Jaya optimization algorithm and Coronavirus Herd Immunity optimization algorithm. The ensemble model with the improved Jaya optimization algorithm achieved excellent results. The best value for accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, F2-score and ROC-AUC score are 92.83\%, 87.76\%, 97.66\%, 88.89\%, 0.9551 and 0.9357, respectively. The main focus of this research is to increase the specificity. A poor value of specificity can lead to a high false positive rate. This situation can increase anxiety and emotionally weaken the patient. The proposed ensemble model with the Improved Jaya optimization algorithm outperformed state-of-the-art techniques and can assist medical experts.},
