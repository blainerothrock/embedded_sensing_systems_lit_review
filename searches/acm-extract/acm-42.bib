abstract = {The current constant of the virtual factor causes the expression "in person" to decrease at its frequency of effective embodiment. It is now being relegated to special situations, with extraordinarily formatted outlines, even assuming the value of a rarity to be avoided. In this way, the importance of the act of "being with" or "being in front of" increases as the time, in which the exception is suitable, must be taken for precious. The distance increase between people, and the emotional detachment from their living place, grounds for actions that promote the human desire to live collectively, share places, objects and experiences. The present research has the concern of developing and supporting, in a project approach, the life quality of people groups at urban areas, anchoring actions in specific characteristics of their identity legacy. Is intended to contribute to healthier social relationships establishment with the adequacy of social action methodologies sustained in artistic intervention as cultural space mediator. Throughout the works, was intended to demonstrate that participatory environments contribute to generate emotional ties. At interaction, meaning formation is benefited by the perception of specific cultural elements, rooted in memory, which people feel greater affinity, and can be integrated into content of the interactive installations production. These matters queries for what would be an appropriated procedure to discover local identity elements to be included in content production. According to this research, and in an attempt to adopt a methodology, was endeavored to structure a procedure for emerging social problems, to listen citizens and collect credible data that will serve to select contents that enhance well-being. Therefore, an iterative procedure has been produced, derived from Delphi method, from the area of Social Diagnosis, using anonymous consultation questionnaires at sample groups of individuals from a territory. It was established that in this procedure the discussion and validation of collected data will be done through a focus group formed by specialists. This innovative procedure is a starting point in the gathering of identity elements at groups of individuals, for the creation of multimedia installations in city spaces, with interactive sensory stimuli in the fields of vision, hearing, touch and proprioception, fostering the expansion of links between individuals, and of these with their place.},

abstract = {This article presents the conceptual proposal related to the construction of a transformational prosthesis, broadly understood as physical and psychic extensions of an individual, in short, as devices that allow them to change their external environment, and, consequently, transform their internal environment. According to the title, this study is in a preliminary stage of development, with a view to submission to development agencies. In its later stages, the project will consider the demands centered on users based on their context and experiences. Initially, the article describes the aim of the partnership, responsible for the production of the prosthesis, which is to develop an environment of scientific and artistic innovation in the synergy between the areas of Arts, Design, Mechatronics and Medicine, and, therefore, expand the possibility of the creation of special upper and lower limb prostheses. Such a partnership has been established between Dr. Monica Tavares, of the School of Communication and Arts at the University of S\~{a}o Paulo (USP), Dr. Chi-Nan Pai, of the Polytechnic School at USP, and Dr. Juliana Henno, of the European Institute of Design. Secondly, the project demonstrates the specifics of what is a transformational prosthesis, which results from the use of objectiles and digital fabrication techniques that aim to supply, correct or increase a given capacity or sense of the individual. Thirdly, it presents the differences between a functional prosthesis and a cosmetic prosthesis, pointing out the intention of the established partnership to work in synergy between art, science and technology, transposing the simple duality between the functional and the cosmetic; here, the initial studies of the functional structure of an upper limb prosthesis are also presented. And, fourthly, possibilities for aesthetic configurations of this prosthesis are shown, considering that the multiplicity and variability of visual options are the theme for its customization.},

abstract = {With improvements in the area of Internet of Things (IoT), surveillance systems have recently become more accessible. At the same time, optimizing the energy requirements of smart sensors, especially for data transmission, has always been very important and the energy efficiency of IoT systems has been the subject of numerous studies. For environmental monitoring scenarios, it is possible to extract more accurate information using smart multimedia sensors. However, multimedia data transmission is an expensive operation. In this study, a novel hierarchical approach is presented for the detection of forest fires. The proposed framework introduces a new approach in which multimedia and scalar sensors are used hierarchically to minimize the transmission of visual data. A lightweight deep learning model is also developed for devices at the edge of the network to improve detection accuracy and reduce the traffic between the edge devices and the sink. The framework is evaluated using a real testbed, network simulations, and 10-fold cross-validation in terms of energy efficiency and detection accuracy. Based on the results of our experiments, the validation accuracy of the proposed system is 98.28\%, and the energy saving is 29.94\%. The proposed deep learning model’s validation accuracy is very close to the accuracy of the best performing architectures when the existing studies and lightweight architectures are considered. In terms of suitability for edge computing, the proposed approach is superior to the existing ones with reduced computational requirements and model size.},

abstract = {Context-based copresence detection schemes are a necessary prerequisite to building secure and usable authentication systems in the Internet of Things (IoT). Such schemes allow one device to verify proximity of another device without user assistance utilizing their physical context (e.g., audio). The state-of-the-art copresence detection schemes suffer from two major limitations: (1) They cannot accurately detect copresence in low-entropy context (e.g., empty room with few events occurring) and insufficiently separated environments (e.g., adjacent rooms), (2) They require devices to have common sensors (e.g., microphones) to capture context, making them impractical on devices with heterogeneous sensors. We address these limitations, proposing Next2You, a novel copresence detection scheme utilizing channel state information (CSI). In particular, we leverage magnitude and phase values from a range of subcarriers specifying a Wi-Fi channel to capture a robust wireless context created when devices communicate. We implement Next2You on off-the-shelf smartphones relying only on ubiquitous Wi-Fi chipsets and evaluate it based on over 95 hours of CSI measurements that we collect in five real-world scenarios. Next2You achieves error rates below 4\%, maintaining accurate copresence detection both in low-entropy context and insufficiently separated environments. We also demonstrate the capability of Next2You to work reliably in real-time and its robustness to various attacks.},

abstract = {Programming is now introduced as an essential skill at a very young age, often through block-based programming environments. Interaction with programs created using such platforms typically occurs through the use of keyboard and mouse. Incorporating environmental data as real-time input to programs through physical computing devices can deliver an engaging programming experience that fosters creativity. However, using such devices with block-based environments often requires significant technical configuration, which can be challenging in the classroom, especially for very young learners. In this paper, we describe our design, development and use of a sensor toolkit and a companion Scratch extension that is very easy for young students to use. The toolkit allows students to focus on constructive exploration while providing teachers with an easy way to incorporate sensor-driven programming lessons in a time-constrained classroom setting. We deployed our toolkit in a primary school classroom with 19 students aged between 7 and 9, and two teachers who were introducing sensor-driven programming for the first time. We report how these young students used our toolkit to control actions in their programs, their post-session views of programming as an interesting and creative task, and the teachers’ perspectives of using the toolkit with young learners.},

abstract = {Aim to accelerate the process of lower limb rehabilitation for post-stroke people, various intelligent lower limb rehabilitation walkers (ILLRW) with body kinetic analysis and feedback control function have been developed to reduce the nursing workload and enhance training performance. In this work, a novel ILLRW is proposed, equipped with a walking remote system via control lever and driver units to assist user's walk correspondingly. However, the walking ability varied significantly from stroke persons, and a system that can interfere with the driving system to adjust the speed according to the pace is critical. Thus, we also developed a walk pattern prediction system (WPPS) to feedback and further optimize the control system. The WPPS includes a laser range finder (LRF) array and plantar pressure sensors at the bottom, wearable pressure sensors at the user's waist, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) at the user's body joints. Altogether, the data get further analyzed and a walk pattern model generated while walking, and it is expected that the movement of the walker can relatively match the user's pace. Experimental result shows that our WPPS can track stroke patient's movement pattern effectively.},

We showcase a wide range of applications made entirely of Alganyl including a sculpture, doll clothing, environment-sensing accessories, and a recycled concert bag. We conducted a user study with 12 participants that made Alganyl at home, fabricated their own applications, and then speculated on future applications for Alganyl. Overall, participants found Alganyl to be an accessible biomaterial that can be used for many applications. We hope designers and HCI researchers will embrace Alganyl as a sustainable biomaterial for making recyclable and biodegradable artifacts.},

abstract = {In modern society, the economic digitalization is gaining momentum, covering almost all its spheres. The versatility and diversity of consumer behavior that exists in each society changes the previous, well-established business models radically. Global changes have also affected the sphere of insurance services. With the advent of insurance technologies, the insurance culture in modern Russia is in constant development. The purpose of this paper is to describe the essence of the InsurTech technology and the psychological grounds for its application in Russian practice. As a result, five bases of psychological analysis were identified when determining the types (or strategies) of insurance behavior, namely, benefit, rationality of choice, risk sensitivity, financial anxiety, and attitude to insurance policy. The psychotypes of policyholders depending on their psychological attitudes are given: "paternalists", "market suppoters" and "neutral". It is concluded that the peculiarities of the attitude of Russian citizens to insurance services in the virtual environment have not yet been sufficiently studied, and research on the transformation of insurance consumers thanks to InsurTech is practically not presented. Nevertheless, there are some trends in the transformation of the behavior of the consumers of insurance services under the influence of the Internet technologies. That is why the makers of both psychological characteristics and demographic variables (sex, age, income level, employment) should be taken into account when developing insurance scoring for aggregators InsurTech.},

abstract = {Climate change and migration have become one of the most challenging problems for our civilization. In this context, city councils work hard to manage essential services for citizens such as waste collection, street lamp lighting, and water supply. Increasingly, digitalization and the Internet of Things (IoT) help cities improve services, increase productivity and reduce costs. However, to understand how this may happen, we explore the urban sensing capabilities from citizen- to city-scale, how sensing at different levels is interlinked, and the challenges of managing innovations based on IoT data and devices.Local authorities collaborate with researchers and deploy testbeds as a part of demonstration and research projects to perform the above data collection, improve city services, and support innovation. The data gathered is about indoor and outdoor environmental conditions, energy usage, built environment, structural health monitoring. Such monitoring requires IT infrastructure at three different tiers: at the endpoint, edge, and cloud. Managing infrastructure at all tiers with provisioning, connectivity, security updates of devices, user data privacy controls, visualization of data, multi-tenancy of applications, and network resilience, is challenging. So, in turn, we focus on performing a systematic study of the technical and non-technical challenges faced during the implementation, management, and deployment of devices into citizens' homes and public spaces.Our third piece of work explores IoT edge applications' resiliency and reliability requirements that vary from non-critical (best delivery efforts) to safety-critical with time-bounded guarantees. We investigate how to meet IoT application mixed-criticality QoS requirements in multi-communication networks.Finally, to demonstrate the principles of our framework in the real world, we implement an open-source air quality platform Open City Air Quality Platform (OpenCAQP), that merges a wide range of data sources and air pollution parameters into a single platform. The OpenCAQP allows citizens, environmentalists, data analysts, and developers to access and visualize that data.},

abstract = {FPGA-enabled cloud computing is getting more and more common as cloud providers offer hardware accelerated solutions. In this context, clients need confidential remote computing. However Intellectual Properties and data are being used and communicated. So current security models require the client to trust the cloud provider blindly by disclosing sensitive information. In addition, the lack of strong authentication and access control mechanisms, for both the client and the provided FPGA in current solutions, is a major security drawback. To enhance security measures and privacy between the client, the cloud provider and the FPGA, an additional entity needs to be introduced: the trusted authority. Its role is to authenticate the client-FPGA pair and isolate them from the cloud provider. With our novel OAuth 2.0-based access delegation solution for FPGA-accelerated clouds, a remote confidential FPGA environment with a token-based access can be created for the client. Our solution allows to manage and securely allocate heterogeneous resource pools with enhanced privacy \&amp; confidentiality for the client. Our formal analysis shows that our protocol adds a very small latency which is suitable for real-time application.},

abstract = {Mobile crowdsensing systems typically operate centralized cloud storage management, and the environment data sensed by the participants are usually uploaded to certain central cloud servers. Instead, this article addresses the decentralized data storage problem in scenarios where cloud servers or network infrastructures do not work as expected and the sensing data have to be temporarily stored on the mobile devices carried by the participants. Considering that the sensing data are generally correlated, this article investigates a compressive distributed storage scheme for mobile crowdsensing. We notice a key observation: when a participant has a random walk in the target sensing area, his walking/sensing process can be considered as a random sampling for the entire area, although the activity of the participant may only have a local scope. We then propose an encoding algorithm based on compressive sensing theory. Each participant encodes the sensing data in their local trajectory, but the encoded CS measurement is capable of roughly reflecting the entire information of the whole area. While a participant stores a blurred global image of the target sensing area, the entire data can then be collaboratively stored by a certain number of participants. We further present a period-based data recovery algorithm to exploit the inter-period correlations, improving the recovery accuracy. Experimental results using real environmental data demonstrate the performance of the proposed compressive storage scheme. The test datasets and our source codes are available at .},

More applications are integrated with cloud-based NLU services to enhance the way people communicate with machines. However, with NLU services provided by different companies powered by unrevealed AI technology, how to choose the best one is a problem for developers. Existing tools that can provide guidance to developers and make recommendations based on their needs are severely limited. This article comprehensively evaluates multiple state-of-the-art NLU services, and the results indicate that there is no absolute winner for different usage requirements. Motivated by this observation, we provide several insights and propose&nbsp;NLUBroker, a Quality of Experience-driven (QoE-driven) broker system, to select the proper service according to the environment. NLUBroker senses the client and service status and leverages a solution to the multi-armed bandit problem to conduct online learning, aiming to achieve maximum expected QoE. The performance of&nbsp;NLUBroker is evaluated in both simulation and real-world environments, and the evaluation results demonstrate that&nbsp;NLUBroker is an efficient solution for selecting NLU services. It is adaptive to changes in the environment, outperforms three baseline methods we evaluated and improves overall QoE up to 1.5\texttimes{} for the evaluated state-of-the-art NLU services.},

abstract = {Google recently introduced a secure chip called Titan&nbsp;M in its Pixel smartphones, enabling the implementation of a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) in Tamper Resistant Hardware. TEEs have been proven effective in reducing the attack surface exposed by smartphones, by protecting specific security-sensitive operations. However, studies have shown that TEE code and execution can also be targeted and exploited by attackers, therefore, studying their security lays the basis of the trust we have in their features. In this paper, we provide the first security analysis of Titan&nbsp;M. First, we reverse engineer the firmware and we review the open source code in the Android OS that is responsible for the communication with the chip. By exploiting a known vulnerability, we then dynamically examine the memory layout and the internals of the chip. Finally, leveraging the acquired knowledge, we design and implement a structure-aware black-box fuzzer. Using our fuzzer, we rediscover several known vulnerabilities after a few seconds of testing, proving the effectiveness of our solution. In addition, we identify and report a new vulnerability in the latest version of the firmware.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) have been developed in many industrial sectors and application domains in which the quality requirements of data acquired are a common factor. Data quality in CPS can deteriorate because of several factors such as sensor faults and failures due to operating in harsh and uncertain environments. How can software engineering and artificial intelligence (AI) help manage and tame data quality issues in CPS? This is the question we aimed to investigate in the SEA4DQ workshop. Emerging trends in software engineering need to take data quality management seriously as CPS are increasingly datacentric in their approach to acquiring and processing data along the edge-fog-cloud continuum. This workshop provided researchers and practitioners a forum for exchanging ideas, experiences, understanding of the problems, visions for the future, and promising solutions to the problems in data quality in CPS. Examples of topics include software/hardware architectures and frameworks for data quality management in CPS; software engineering and AI to detect anomalies in CPS data or to repair erroneous CPS data. SEA4DQ 2021, which took place on August 24th, 2021 was a satellite event of the ACM Joint European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (ESEC / FSE) 2021. The workshop attracted 35 international participants and was exciting with a great keynote, six excellent presentations, and concluded on a high note with a panel discussion. SEA4DQ was motivated by the common research interests from the EU projects for Zero-Defects Manufacturing such as InterQ and Dat4.Zero.},

This paper details the reinvention of a public space in Clearwater, Florida with a large-scale mural program. We discuss the development of an interactive augmented reality (AR) app that utilizes a 3D terrestrial lidar scan to assist in the identification and testing of feature points within target images of the mural. The combination of multisensory stimuli, including physical cues in the built environment, and audiovisual cues from the app, reinforce the artwork's message of community empowerment, while enhancing the public perception of downtown Clearwater as a destination for art, culture, and technology.},

abstract = {With the advancement of the Internet of Things in our smart environment, smart devices are working without human intervention. So home can be converted to intelligent home automation systems to perform its computation automatically. In a pandemic situation, the majority of people have spent their maximum time at home. So indoor air quality, insider’s and outsider’s health monitoring has become an important issue. As respiratory diseases are the main concern for pandemics, we have to develop an intelligent home system model to monitor healthy environmental conditions for the users. This paper proposes an energy-efficient smart system model to monitor the health and environmental condition by measuring the carbon monoxide threat level that indirectly affects other atmospheric parameters. Our system alerts when the carbon monoxide level exceeds the safe level. Remote monitoring of the home and health parameters is done in real-time with the help of the system model. For this purpose, we are adopting Dempster-Shafer evidence theory as a mathematical model to aggregate the data coming from different sensors. The sensor nodes track the home and health parameters such as room temperature, humidity, carbon monoxide level, SpO2 level, body temperature, and pulse rate. The smartphone app updates the user’s real-time sensor data through the display and indirectly helps to maintain the physical distance. The proposed intelligent home-health system model is compact, cost-effective, energy-efficient for the user, and is especially useful for the quarantined covid affected people in a pandemic situation.},

Aerial search is a common mission and is intrinsically fit for UAVs, e.g. disaster rescue, remote sensing and environmental monitoring. With the improvement of UAV hardware and software, UAVs tend to achieve better autonomy and accomplish more complex tasks. However, current UAV aerial search is usually hardcoded, which limits their adaptability, autonomy and robustness in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we propose to address this problem by leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) and a recent control architecture, behavior trees (BTs). We develop robust and adaptive UAV systems that can automatically conduct multi-phase complex aerial search, including search, communication and refueling. Experimental results in a 3D robot simulator verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach, which achieves better performance than the baseline.},

abstract = {With the recent advances in human sensing, the push to integrate human mobility tracking with epidemic modeling highlights the lack of groundwork at the mesoscale (e.g., city-level) for both contact tracing and transmission dynamics. Although GPS data has been used to study city-level outbreaks in the past, existing approaches fail to capture the path of infection at the individual level. Consequently, in this paper, we extend epidemics prediction from estimating the size of an outbreak at the population level to estimating the individuals who may likely get infected within a finite period of time. To this end, we propose a network science based method to first build and then prune the dynamic contact networks for recurring interactions; these networks can serve as the backbone topology for mechanistic epidemics modeling. We test our method using Foursquare's Points of Interest (POI) smart phone geolocation data from over 1.3 million devices to better approximate the COVID-19 infection curves for two major (yet very different) US cities, (i.e., Austin and New York City), while maintaining the granularity of individual transmissions and reducing model uncertainty. Our method provides a foundation for building a disease prediction framework at the mesoscale that can help both policy makers and individuals better understand their estimated state of health and help the pandemic mitigation efforts.},

Gesture recognition based on WiFi has the advantages of non-contact and privacy protection. In addition, the use of home WiFi makes the technology have a broad application scenario. At present, most gesture recognition models based on WiFi can only achieve good results in a specific domain. When changing the environment or the orientation of gesture action, the performance of the model becomes very poor. This paper proposes a gesture recognition system based on the channel attention mechanism and CNN-LSTM fusion model. On the one hand, the channel attention mechanism can consider the importance of different channel characteristics; On the other hand, the CNN-LSTM fusion model can extract richer features in the time domain and space domain. The system has achieved good classification results in multiple domains of the public data set widar3.0.},

abstract = {The rapid advancements in AI and Machine Learning (ML) technology, from both industry and academia lead to the need of large-scale, efficient and safe model sharing. With recent models, reproducibility has gained tremendous complexity both on the execution and the resource consumption level. Although sharing source-code and access to data is becoming common practice, the training process is limited by software dependencies, (sometimes large-scale) computation power, specialized hardware, and is time-sensitive. Next to these limitations, trained models are gaining financial value and organizations are reluctant to release models for public access. All these severely hinder the timely dissemination and the scientific sharing and reviewing process, limiting reproducibility. In this work we make the case for transparent and seamless model sharing to enable the ease of reviewing and reproducibility for ML practitioners. We design and implement a platform to enable practitioners to deploy trained models and create easy-to-use inference environments, which can be easily shared with peers, conference reviewers, and/or made publicly available. Our solution follows a provider agnostic practice and can be used internally in institutional infrastructures or public/private cloud providers.},

Based on their use of personally accessible health records, we inquired into their explicit perception of security and sense of data privacy in relation to their health data. Our goal was to provide insights and guidelines to designers and developers on the communication of data protection in health records in an accessible way for the users. We analyzed their approach to and experience with their own health care records and describe the details of their challenges. A conceptual framework called "Privacy Awareness' was developed from the findings and reflects the perspectives of the users. The conceptual framework forms the basis of a proposal for design guidelines for Digital Health Record systems, which aim to address, facilitate and improve the users' awareness of the protection of their online health data.},

Psychology research has shown that tickling and laughter can significantly relieve stress. Although several tickling artifacts have been suggested in prior work, limited knowledge is available if those artifacts could evoke laughter. In this article, we aim at filling this gap by designing and developing a novel foot-tickling mechanism that can evoke laughter. We first developed an actuator that can create tickling sensations along the sole of the foot utilising magnet-driven brushes. Then, we conducted two studies to identify the most ticklish locations of the foot’s sole and stimulation patterns that can evoke laughter. In a follow-up study with a new set of participants, we confirmed that the identified stimuli could evoke laughter. From the participants’ feedback, we derived several applications that such a simulation could be useful. Finally, we embedded our actuators into a flexible insole, demonstrating the potential of a wearable tickling insole.},

abstract = {The healthcare industry is one of the top priorities for every country, as the government wants to improve the process and provide better services to the public in the health sector. In COVID19, there is a need to immediate response and secured way of storing data due to overwhelming patients admitting to the hospitals. Many stakeholders are involved in the health sector, such as patients, doctors, pharmaceutical companies, laboratories, and hospitals which makes the complete system complex. Security and privacy are the major concern of comprehensive patient-related information accessed by the involved participants. Blockchain technology is capable of ensuring data integrity and privacy with immutable features. The blockchain technology can be implemented in public and private means, but the medical data is sensitive information which cannot be shared to the public. In this paper, the permissioned blockchain is implemented for healthcare sector using Hyperledger Fabric. The Fabric is an open-source platform through which a Smart Contract is developed on the blockchain network. With the help of a smart contract, the secure transaction is performed on the ledger to store the confidential data related to a patient. The data stored in the form of an immutable block ensures the security of health records stored on distributed ledger through a smart contract. With this implementation, the efficient healthcare process is simplified and the transactions with multiple end-users are done securely, leading to transparency and traceability.},

Generally, sensors are positioned in such an environment wherever it is typical to reach the sensors and change or recharge them. QoS is critical in prolonging the network lifetime and attaining better throughput for a large network in WSN. Hence, a practical protocol is required that improves QoS and enhances the lifetime of the network. In this paper, QoS Learning Approach (QoS-LA) using Reinforcement Learning is developed and assessed. The proposed routing approach prolongs network lifetime by electing the optimum route to send data. The best route is selected as per extreme residual power at SN for a next-hop with excellence link and delay with error rate. The proposed approach is implemented on MATLAB on various SNs 100--1000.to judge the effectiveness on multiple parameters and assessed with state-of-the-art algorithms CNN, QoS-R, and KNN. The Simulation outcomes reveal that the QoS-LA approach offers the better results in terms of energy consumption reduces 14\%-16\%, number of alive nodes enhances 18\%-20\% that provides the network lifetime, and enhances the throughput to send data to base station 9\%-11\%.},

Children with ASD also have unique patterns of sensory processing when responding to the stimuli in the environment. In this study, a real-time monitoring system has been designed and developed for attention and stress detection. Comprehensive sensory information, including environmental, physiological, and sensory profile data can be collected by the system using sensors, smart devices, and a standard sensory profiling questionnaire. Data acquisition with 35 ASD children using the system prototype was successfully conducted. With the acquired data set, different machine learning models were trained to predict attentional and stress level. Among all the investigated models, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree and Random Forest obtained the best prediction accuracies of 86.67\% and 99.05\% on attention and stress detection respectively. The two models were then implemented into the system for automatic detection. Future work could be focusing on exploring more supportive features to improve the prediction accuracy for attention detection. Such an easily-accessed monitoring system tailored for children with ASD could be widely-used in daily life to assist ASD users with their attention and stress management.},

We utilize a mixed reality headset with on-board depth sensors to build a digital map of the real world and a suit with an array of actuators to provide feedback as to indicate to the visually impaired the position of obstacles around them. This is demonstrated by a simple prototype built using commercially available devices (Microsoft HoloLens and bHaptics Tactot) and a qualitative user study was conducted to evaluate the viability of the proposed system. Through our user-testing performed on subjects with simulated visual impairments, our results affirm the potential of using mixed reality to detect obstacles in the environment along with only transmitting essential information through the haptic suit due to limited bandwidth.},

abstract = {Activity recognition based on egocentric multimodal data collected by wearable devices has become increasingly popular recently. However, conventional activity recognition methods face the dilemma of the lack of large-scale labeled egocentric multimodal datasets due to the high cost of data collection. In this paper, we propose a new task of few-shot egocentric multimodal activity recognition, which has at least two significant challenges. On the one hand, it is difficult to extract effective features from the multimodal data sequences of video and sensor signals due to the scarcity of the samples. On the other hand, how to robustly recognize novel activity classes with very few labeled samples becomes another more critical challenge due to the complexity of the multimodal data. To resolve the challenges, we propose a two-stream graph network, which consists of a heterogeneous graph-based multimodal association module and a knowledge-aware activity classifier module. The former uses a heterogeneous graph network to comprehensively capture the dynamic and complementary information contained in the multimodal data stream. The latter learns robust activity classifiers through knowledge propagation among the classifier parameters of different classes. In addition, we adopt episodic training strategy to improve the generalization ability of the proposed few-shot activity recognition model. Experiments on two public datasets show that the proposed model achieves better performances than other baseline models.},

abstract = {The increasing pressure of college students has become a social problem that has received widespread attention. Biologists’ research has shown that natural environments and highly “controlled” settings (such as botanical gardens) can help participants and observers reduce stress and maintain calm and peace. According to research published in the Journal of Environment \&amp; Behavior, those who spend time observing large aquariums or even smaller fish tanks may improve their physical and mental health. Virtual reality technology is the crystallization of the rapid development of computer software and hardware technology, sensor technology, robotics, artificial intelligence, and behavioral psychology. It can give users an immersive sense of immersion and a perfect interaction with the environment. Ability has been widely used in many fields such as medicine, entertainment, and education, and has provided more possibilities for the development of traditional technologies. This article simulates the "natural (aquatic) environment" through a virtual aquarium based on VR technology, and takes students from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China as the survey object, using the form of questionnaires, and using the results of questionnaires and heart rate measurements to determine whether college students are affected by species abundance and the influence of fish abundance. The project will provide evidence that VR technology can help college students reduce their stress.},

abstract = {In this article, we present a novel approach for continuous operator authentication in teleoperated robotic processes based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM). While HMMs were originally developed and widely used in speech recognition, they have shown great performance in human motion and activity modeling. We make an analogy between human language and teleoperated robotic processes (i.e., words are analogous to a teleoperator’s gestures, sentences are analogous to the entire teleoperated task or process) and implement HMMs to model the teleoperated task. To test the continuous authentication performance of the proposed method, we conducted two sets of analyses. We built a virtual reality (VR) experimental environment using a commodity VR headset (HTC Vive) and haptic feedback enabled controller (Sensable PHANToM Omni) to simulate a real teleoperated task. An experimental study with 10 subjects was then conducted. We also performed simulated continuous operator authentication by using the JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set (JIGSAWS). The performance of the model was evaluated based on the continuous (real-time) operator authentication accuracy as well as resistance to a simulated impersonation attack. The results suggest that the proposed method is able to achieve 70\% (VR experiment) and 81\% (JIGSAWS dataset) continuous classification accuracy with as short as a 1-second sample window. It is also capable of detecting an impersonation attack in real-time.},

abstract = {With the continuous development of deep learning in computer vision, object detection technology is constantly employed for processing remote sensing images. Especially, ship detection has become a significant and challenging task due to complex environmental factors (strong waves, clouds interference, etc.) and object issues (orientation, scale variety, density, etc.). Current detection methods pay more attention to the detection accuracy while ignoring the detection speed. In contrast with accuracy, detection speed is more important in some cases such as marine rescue and vessel tracking. Aiming at addressing these problems, we propose an enhanced YOLOv4(C-YOLOv4) which contains the feature fusion attention module (FAM) with a channel correlation loss(C-loss). C-loss is proposed to constrain the relations between object classes and channels while maintaining the intra-class and the inter-class separability. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, comprehensive experiments are conducted on a public dataset HRSC2016. According to the experimental results, our proposed approach outperforms the baselines.},

This work aims to obtain evidence of theoretical and technological aspects of iL from the Symposium on Virtual and Augmented Reality (SVR) publications. A Systematic Literature Mapping protocol was developed and executed in order to select the primary studies to perform the analysis and data extraction. 76 primary studies helped to answer the research questions. A large part of the contributions by the SVR community are virtual environments that support education in the health area. In addition, some gaps and research opportunities were identified: virtual environments that serve audiences with special needs; development frameworks that consider pedagogical aspects and the use of biometric measures to support the validation of improved learning outcomes.},

abstract = {Research on the Fish Tank Virtual Reality (FTVR) technique commonly uses specific sensors (e.g. infrared cameras and LEDs on glasses) to estimate user’s eye position. However, estimating the face position with an RGB camera is becoming more accessible. In this work, we explore community available face characteristics detection software to implement the FTVR technique for everyday uses of 3D-enabled applications on consumer notebooks without requiring extra devices. We introduce the Parallax Engine solution that can be added with ease to any Unity game engine application. The solution supports two parallax-related visualization options: 1) a monoscopic FTVR mode (FishTank), which locks the virtual camera of the 3D environment to the laptop’s screen 2) and a 2D parallax mode (Parallax2DoF), which allows horizontal and vertical displacement of 3D scene camera. Regarding face characteristics detection techniques, the Parallax Engine uses a standardized interface that can receive input from different methods and currently supports three options: Google’s MediaPipe, dlib, and PoseNet. We evaluated the proposed solution with five users, performing tasks using different options for viewing and face characteristics detection, aiming to understand how suitable it is for end-users. Besides some detection failures from dlib, results showed an overall good acceptance for both the FishTank and Parallax2DoF visualization options.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic impacted researches that depended on making tests on patients and teams that had to be divided to avoid crowding in laboratories. Sharing equipment is no longer a simple strategy; the acquisition of extra equipment is beyond the means of many researchers. Research with Kinect V2 applied to body tracking suffers from sanitary restrictions, product discontinuation and limited access to newer sensors (like the Azure Kinect). Kinect V2 is an RGB-D sensor with many applications in health, ergonomics, sports, games and other areas. That is why a lot of research is still under development with it. Because of the applicability of Kinect V2 on research and the current acquisition limitations, Virtual Kinect (VK) was created. VK is an open-source solution that enables the programmer to code using Kinect SDK functions and test it without a Kinect V2 sensor or a previous recording. It simulates the behavior of a Kinect V2 sensor through MediaPipe’s Pose estimation, providing RGB image and joint tracking information, correlating the joints of the two devices. This correlation is possible due to the proximity of the devices’ joint estimates. The VK was made to be simple and practical, so that its use only depends on the DLL exchange and the use of an ordinary RGB camera.},
