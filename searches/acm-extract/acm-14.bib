abstract = {As artificial intelligence technology continues to advance, the application of robots in the medical field is rapidly expanding. Clinical data and market statistics indicate that medical robots, renowned for their high precision and other notable advantages, greatly enhance medical outcomes and improve patient treatment experiences. This paper aims to develop and optimize a specific type of micro-robot designed for targeted drug delivery, focusing on the design and implementation of a magnetically controlled ciliary motion propulsion mechanism. This mechanism enables precise control of the micro-robot's trajectory through external magnetic fields, allowing it to navigate effectively within complex vascular systems. The study explores the selection of biocompatible materials and the development of an adaptive control algorithm to regulate the robot's movement with high precision. Additionally, a real-time imaging system is integrated to provide accurate positional information and optimize drug release timing. In vitro simulations demonstrate that the micro-robot can achieve precise localization in target areas, with a 25\% increase in targeting efficiency and a 15\% improvement in timing control accuracy compared to traditional methods. Further optimization of magnetic field distribution and control algorithms enhances the robot's adaptability and stability in complex vascular environments. The paper also discusses future directions, including the integration of multi-modal sensors and more intelligent drug release mechanisms, highlighting the potential to expand the application of micro-robots in targeted drug delivery and contribute to the advancement of medical robotics.},

abstract = {Many of today’s message-passing systems not only require messages to be exchanged in a certain order but also to happen at a certain time or within a certain time window. Such correctness conditions are particularly prominent in Internet of Things (IoT) and real-time systems applications, which interface with hardware devices that come with inherent timing constraints. Verifying compliance of such systems with the intended timed protocol is challenged by their heterogeneity—ruling out any verification method that relies on the system to be implemented in one common language, let alone in a high-level and typed programming language. To address this challenge, this paper contributes a logical relation to verify that its inhabitants (the applications and hardware devices to be proved correct) comply with the given timed protocol. To cater to the systems’ heterogeneity, the logical relation is entirely semantic, lifting the requirement that its inhabitants are syntactically well-typed. A semantic approach enables two modes of use of the logical relation for program verification: (i) once-and-for-all verification of an arbitrary well-typed application, given a type system, and (ii) per-instance verification of a specific application / hardware device (foreign code). To facilitate mode (i), the paper develops a refinement type system for expressing timed message-passing protocols and proves that any well-typed program inhabits the logical relation (fundamental theorem). A type checker for the refinement type system has been implemented in Rust, using an SMT solver to check satisfiability of timing constraints. Then, the paper demonstrates both modes of use based on a small case study of a smart home system for monitoring air quality, consisting of a controller application and various environment sensors.},

abstract = {Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases globally (around 50M people globally). Fortunately, up to 70\% of people with epilepsy could live seizure-free if properly diagnosed and treated, and a reliable technique to monitor the onset of seizures could improve the quality of life of patients who are constantly facing the fear of random seizure attacks. The current gold standard, video-EEG (v-EEG), involves attaching over 20 electrodes to the scalp, is costly, requires hospitalization, trained professionals, and is uncomfortable for patients. To address this gap, we developed EarSD, a lightweight and unobtrusive ear-worn system to detect seizure onsets by measuring physiological signals behind the ears. This system can be integrated into earphones, headphones, or hearing aids, providing a convenient solution for continuous monitoring. EarSD is an integrated custom-built sensing-computing-communication ear-worn platform to capture seizure signals, remove the noises caused by motion artifacts and environmental impacts, and stream the collected data wirelessly to the computer/mobile phone nearby. EarSD’s ML algorithm, running on a server, identifies seizure-associated signatures and detects onset events. We evaluated the proposed system in both in-lab and in-hospital experiments at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center with epileptic seizure patients, confirming its usability and practicality.},

abstract = {Underground coal mines (UCMs) environment is has a hazardous environment because of the presence of different toxic and inflammable gases. In UCMs, the presence of trapped gases may cause accidents and lead to loss of miners lives and property. To mitigate the risks associated with high accumulation of gases, environment monitoring plays a major role in monitoring of emission rates of various gases. Conventional monitoring techniques are being widely used in many UCMs across the world to monitor UCM environment. Although the usage of these techniques is high, however they are operated manually and are not continuous in operation. Hence, IoT based continuous monitoring systems need to be developed for underground mine environment monitoring so as to avoid dangerous occurrences in UCMs. Recently various IoT based systems utilizing wireless sensor networks are being developed to monitor the environment of UCMs to establish continuous monitoring system. Such advancements and an in-depth analysis in continuous UCM environment monitoring are discussed in the present work. This survey will help future researchers in identifying research trends in continuous environment monitoring.},

abstract = {Cloud-assisted cyber-physical systems (C-CPS) manage substantial volumes of sensitive data, necessitating robust security measures and secure search mechanisms to protect confidentiality and ensure efficient access to stored information. Attribute-based searchable encryption (ABSE) facilitates these goals by providing fine-grained access control and keyword search functionality for secure data sharing. However, most existing ABSE approaches compromise the privacy of sensitive access policies and lack expressive access control, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic C-CPS environments. To address these challenges, we propose a practical ciphertext-policy attribute-based searchable encryption (CP-ABSE) scheme that supports secure and expressive authorized keyword searches for efficient data retrieval. Our scheme allows data owners to encrypt keyword indexes under specific access policies, enabling searches only for users whose attributes satisfy the defined policies. Before uploading ciphertext to the cloud, each attribute of the access policy is scrambled using an anonymous key agreement protocol to secure the rules governing the keyword access. Our proposed CP-ABSE scheme supports flexible and expressive access structures, enabling the definition of policies using any monotone access formula over encrypted data. Additionally, it utilizes an efficient ciphertext blinding technique to ensure that unauthorized parties, including key generation centers and cloud providers, cannot access sensitive data. Furthermore, it securely offloads the computational overhead of search operations to the cloud server, eliminating the need for data owner interaction and reducing the load on resource-limited user devices. Our theoretical analysis validates the scheme’s effectiveness and security, making it a robust and scalable solution for practical keyword-based data sharing in real-time C-CPS.},

abstract = {Typically, in a cyber-physical system (CPS), timing jitters between sensing and actuation adversely affect its physical behavior. Logical execution time (LET) paradigm has gained industry attention because it offers zero jitters in tasks’ response time. In autonomous CPS such as self-driving cars, Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) is becoming a popular software platform to implement computation tasks. Towards a practical LET implementation of ROS2 computation chains, we propose to use at least two table-driven reservation servers: (i)&nbsp;one exclusively runs the processor thread that publishes the chain’s output while (ii)&nbsp;others isolate the chain’s main computations from best-effort workloads on the same processing unit. We show how to architecturally adapt the chain non-intrusively as well as dimension the servers and allocate appropriate threads to them so that we obtain negligible jitters while keeping the observed maximum end-to-end latency comparable to a high-priority execution of the chain. Also, our approach is versatile and can produce latency bands, thereby offering an opportunity to co-optimize jitters and average end-to-end latency. This further supports multi-mode application design, which is especially important for a high-performance operation in different environments, e.g., city and highway driving. Our idea does not involve modification or recompilation of the application code or ROS2 libraries, which is crucial in industry settings. We have also developed tools to automate our approach. By applying our proposed mechanism on a real-world benchmark implementing Lidar-based localization, we maintain a constant end-to-end latency that is even 13\% shorter than an improved LET implementation.},

abstract = {Homomorphic encryption is a standard that allows arithmetic and logical operations to be performed on encrypted data. This is relevant in data analytics, where sensitive data such as health records or bank transactions cannot be shared. Many of these tasks are based on IoT devices, so integrating Homomorphic Encryption (HE) in the existing systems can ensure a reliable level of data privacy. Therefore, we have experimented with three Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) libraries and accompanying schemes on the Raspberry Pi 4. Our emphasis was on analysing other factors such as temperature and RAM usage accounting for the resource constrained device. In the fast evolving realm of FHE libraries supporting various schemes, this study has given an insight to the current standings of the most common libraries in terms of computation efficiency and implementation optimisation. We have found that OpenFHE library has a better implementation of the BFV scheme with regards to CPU usage and server-side arithmetic operations, being on average 50.4\% better than the second best library. SEAL has outperformed the other libraries with a relatively lower temperature profile and faster arithmetic on BFV and CKKS schemes. On the other hand, key generation is far better on Lattigo, being on average 12.7 times faster than other libraries.},

abstract = {QUIC is a UDP-based transport protocol, standardized in RFC9000 (2021). It enhances privacy by encrypting entire packets and offers improvements over TCP, such as native multiplexing and connection migration. Despite these advantages, QUIC, like TCP, suffers from head-of-line blocking and variable latency, making it unsuitable for critical real-time systems.RFC9221 addresses this by introducing an extension that allows QUIC to transmit datagrams without retransmission, improving its suitability for real-time applications. However, real-time networks require a thorough evaluation of QUIC’s performance. The potential delays caused by its cryptographic operations and the complex traffic patterns it generates could impact time-sensitive traffic.We conduct experiments using Mininet across a range of scenarios, including software updates in bandwidth-constrained environments and in the presence of malicious nodes. Additionally, we assess implementations in both Go and C. The performance of QUIC, along with its datagram extension, is compared against UDP and DTLS. Finally, the results are validated through testing on a physical network testbed.Our results show that, despite its cryptographic overhead, QUIC performs similarly to UDP and DTLS in most cases. However, it may interact poorly with lower-layer mechanisms like token-bucket filters. Overall, QUIC shows potential to replace older transport protocols in real-time systems.},

abstract = {Climatic changes across the world have affected the precipitation pattern of the atmosphere. The changes in precipitation pattern of the air results in Haze formation, which reduces the visibility. Haze affects the safety of transportation and even dense haze may disrupt the airways. Hence, Haze removal process is an essential for any autonomous vehicle. The navigation of an autonomous vehicle relies on sensors like cameras, LiDAR, and RADAR, to perceive their environment. Haze can obscure the view of cameras and degrade the performance of LiDAR by scattering and absorbing light, leading to inaccurate or incomplete data. Improving visibility by removing haze ensures that these sensors can accurately detect and identify objects, road markings, traffic signs, and other critical elements. Based on the observation from the literature survey, it was understood that the existing techniques perform well for mild hazy images and their performance deteriorates for dense conditions. Hence a novel approach for removing dense haze and non-homogeneous haze using a deep learning framework based on an auto-encoder has been proposed. An auto-encoder in the name of Light Weight Dehazer (LW-Dehazer) with 1.1 M learnable parameters has been developed from scratch by stacking Convolution Blocks (CBs) with convolution layer, Gaussian Error Linear Unit and batch normalization layer in encoder and Transposed Convolution Blocks (TCBs) with transposed convolution layer in decoder. The performance of the proposed work has been empirically evaluated on Dense-Haze dataset and Non-Homogeneous Haze dataset. Experiments resulted in average PSNR of 16.25 dB and 19.94 dB, an average SSIM value of 0.572 and 0.7735 on Dense-Haze and Non-Homogeneous(NH)-Haze dataset respectively.},

The findings indicate that: (1) The volume of publications on UGS and the UHI effect has generally shown an upward trend. At the nodes of the promulgation of national policies, the number of publications has increased significantly, but the upward trend is not stable, and it may decline after 2024.

abstract = {Human action recognition (HAR) plays a key role in various applications such as video analysis, surveillance, autonomous driving, robotics, and healthcare. Most HAR algorithms are developed from RGB images, which capture detailed visual information. However, these algorithms raise concerns in privacy-sensitive environments due to the recording of identifiable features. Event cameras offer a promising solution by capturing scene brightness changes sparsely at the pixel level, without capturing full images. Moreover, event cameras have high dynamic ranges that can effectively handle scenarios with complex lighting conditions, such as low light or high contrast environments. However, using event cameras introduces challenges in modeling the spatially sparse and high temporal resolution event data for HAR. To address these issues, we propose the SpikMamba framework, which combines the energy efficiency of spiking neural networks and the long sequence modeling capability of Mamba to efficiently capture global features from spatially sparse and high a temporal resolution event data. Additionally, to improve the locality of modeling, a spiking window-based linear attention mechanism is used. Extensive experiments show that SpikMamba achieves remarkable recognition performance, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 1.45\%, 7.22\%, 0.15\%, and 3.92\% on the PAF, HARDVS, DVS128, and E-FAction datasets, respectively.

A deep learning-based ship detection method is proposed to address the challenges of large object scale variations, background interference, and the tendency for small targets to be misdetected or undetected in satellite remote sensing images. Firstly, the DCNv2 module is integrated into the YOLOv7-tiny network to help the network adaptively identify regions of interest in images, thereby better capturing the detailed features and spatial relationships of the targets for feature optimization. Secondly, the DSConv module is introduced during the feature fusion stage to better capture the shape characteristics of the targets. Lastly, the Dyhead, which combines scale awareness, spatial awareness, and task awareness, is used as the detection head of the improved model to enhance feature expression capabilities and improve detection performance. Experimental results show that compared to YOLOv7-tiny, the improved network only increases computational load by 0.9\%, but the accuracy and mAP@0.5 are improved by 3.6\% and 4.5\%, reaching 83.3\% and 82.6\% respectively. This model achieves better detection performance while being suitable for deployment in environments with limited computing resources, demonstrating significant practical engineering value.},

This paper, in the context of this broader background, employs modern high-tech solutions and advanced sensing equipment to study the settlement and convergence of road tunnel vaults, as well as crack detection technology. By monitoring tunnel deformation, relevant tunnel deformation data is obtained, and real-time data is transmitted to the intelligent tunnel monitoring and operation system using network technology. This provides data support for subsequent maintenance strategies, offering significant guidance for the safety of tunnel operations and the improvement of management levels.},

The mechanism adopts two computers to form a matching system with running environment symmetry, external input symmetry and attack feedback asymmetry. Basing on the difference comparison of the output signals of the two computer networks, it can effectively perceive the existence of highly hidden attacks, and this perception ability has the characteristics of strong real-time, high sensitivity and cannot be tampered by any software method.},

abstract = {The rapidly growing field of wearable computing has demonstrated significant promise in its ability to transform and enhance the quality of human existence fundamentally. The increasing adoption of hardware and software technology has led to the ubiquitous presence of smart wearable gadgets in our everyday lives. Certainly, the issue of ensuring safe data transfer in wearable computing has emerged as a significant challenge that has attracted much attention from the academic community. In this regard, several authentication procedures have been developed for wearable devices in order to offer secure and reliable communication. However, the majority of the current protocols are susceptible to various security vulnerabilities. Very recently, Tu et al. presented an authenticated key exchange protocol for wearable computing. In this article, we deliberate on the security issues of Tu et al.’s protocol (IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, 10.1109/TMC.2023.3297854). They declared that their protocol preserves anonymity and is capable enough to resist masquerading and password-guessing attacks. The security analysis in this article reveals significant vulnerabilities in the authentication phase of Tu et al.’s protocol. We have identified that the adversary can successfully masquerade the sensor and user through this protocol. Moreover, their protocol violates anonymity and is vulnerable to device stolen and password guessing attacks. Consequently, we suggest a possible solution for attack resilience.},

abstract = {This article introduces a hybrid framework for trustworthy and responsible natural resource management, aimed at building bottom-up trust to enhance cooperation among decision-makers in the food, energy, and water sectors. Cooperation is highly critical for the adoption and application of resource management alternatives (solutions), including those generated by AI-based recommender systems, in communities due to significant impact of these sectors on the environment and the economic productivity of affected communities. While algorithms can recommend solutions, effectively communicating and gaining community acceptance of these solutions is crucial. Our research stands out by emphasizing the collaboration between humans and machines, which is essential for addressing broader challenges related to climate change and the need for expert tradeoff handling in the management of natural resources. To support future decision-making, we propose a successful control-theory model based on previous decision-making and actor behavior. We utilize control theory to depict how community decisions can be affected by how much individuals trust and accept proposed solutions on irrigation water rights and crop operations in an iterative and interactive decision support environment. This model interacts with stakeholders to collect their feedback on the acceptability of solutions, while also examining the influence of consensus levels, trust sensitivities, and the number of decision-making rounds on the acceptance of proposed solutions. Furthermore, we investigate a system of multiple decision-making and explore the impact of learning actors who adjust their trust sensitivities based on solution acceptance and the number of decision-making rounds. Additionally, our approach can be employed to evaluate and refine potential policy modifications. Although we assess potential outcomes using hypothetical actions by individuals, it is essential to emphasize our primary objective of developing a tool that accurately captures real human behavior and fosters improved collaboration in community decision-making. Ultimately, our aim is to enhance the harmony between AI-based recommender systems and human values, promoting a deeper understanding and integration between the two.},

abstract = {Training machine learning models to identify human behavior is a difficult yet essential task to develop autonomous and adaptive systems such as smart homes. These models require large and diversified amounts of labeled data to be trained effectively. Due to the high variety of home environments and occupant behaviors, collecting datasets that are representative of all possible homes is a major challenge. In addition, privacy and cost are major hurdles to collect real home data. To avoid these difficulties, one solution consists of training these models using purely synthetic data, which can be generated through the simulation of home and their occupants. Two challenges arise from this approach: designing a methodology with a simulation able to generate credible simulated data and evaluating this credibility. In this article, we explain the methodology used to generate diversified synthetic data of daily activities, through the combination of an agent model to simulate an occupant and a simulated 3D house enriched with sensors and effectors to produce such data. We demonstrate the credibility of the generated synthetic data by comparing their efficacy for training human context understanding models against the efficacy generated by real data. To achieve this, we replicate a real dataset collection setting with our smart home simulator. The occupant is replaced by an autonomous agent following the same experimental protocol used for the real dataset collection. This agent is a BDI-based model enhanced with a scheduler designed to offer a balance between control and autonomy. This balance is useful in synthetic data generation since strong constraints can be imposed on the agent to simulate desired situations while allowing autonomous behaviors outside these constraints to generate diversified data. In our case, the constraints are those imposed during the real dataset collection that we want to replicate. The simulated sensors and effectors were configured to react to the agent’s behaviors similarly to the real ones. We experimentally show that data generated from this simulation are valuable for two human context understanding tasks: current human activity recognition and future human activity prediction. In particular, we show that models trained solely with simulated data can give reasonable predictions about real situations occurring in the original dataset. We also report experimental results regarding statistical analysis and C2ST to assess the credibility of generated data. We discuss the generality of our approach for evaluating the credibility of simulated data from their use as training data.},

Despite its benefits, this shift brings challenges, such as asynchronous communication and a lack of social interactions. To overcome these obstacles, development teams are adopting metaverse environments. In this context, this research investigates the impact of using metaverse environments on the experience of members of remote software development teams. To this end, we conducted surveys and interviews with ten practitioners from three software development companies that use Gather.Town. The results indicate that metaverse environments such as Gather.Town facilitates collaboration in remote software development teams through social interaction, a sense of presence, and efficient communication, overcoming the limitations of traditional remote work, such as social isolation. This report demonstrates that using metaverse environments can enhance communication and collaboration in remote teams, providing a more integrated and efficient work experience.},

abstract = {The number of individuals with depression is gradually increasing worldwide. In the university population, the prevalence of depression is even higher than in the general population. Health and computing researchers have sought to create computational solutions that can support diagnosis and create interventions for people with a possible depressive profile, analyzing their behavior through the collection of digital phenotyping data, such as heart rate and sleep quality, coming from sensors present in mobile and wearable devices, such as smartphones and smartwatches. Research in this area is multidisciplinary, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers have a major role in supporting the design of this technology. In this sense, the goal of this paper is mapping, among others, how final users and health professionals have been involved in this type of research. We performed a Systematic Mapping focusing on the university environment. We extracted data about the methodological approach adopted, sensor data collected, and human involvement. The results show which data is being collected and correlated with depression indicators, the absence of multidisciplinary teams, and the lack of adoption of protocols to manage mental health emergencies. We also discussed possibilities for human-in-the-loop approaches and some design implications for HCI teams.},

abstract = {Sleep is a vital physiological need for human health and well-being, and its quality plays a crucial role in our daily lives. Inadequate sleep can lead to a range of health problems, including chronic fatigue, lack of concentration, cognitive impairment, and an increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Amidst an increasingly aware society of the benefits of well slept nights, there is a growing interest in monitoring and optimizing sleep. This trend is amplified by the continuous advancement of technology, particularly the increase of the Internet of Things (IoT) and E-Health technologies. In this context, the development of consumer sleep technologies emerges alongside the increasingly easier methods to utilize them and the growing awareness of the importance of sleep for health. These technologies offer a variety of solutions, ranging from mobile applications to smart wearable devices. These tools can empower individuals to take steps to improve their sleep hygiene and, consequently, their quality of life. However, some user reviews on the Google Play platform raises issues related to their user experience across all consumer sleep technologies. This article aims to evaluate the User Experience of consumer sleep technologies based on users reviews on Google Play by using the extended MALTU instrument. The evaluation consists in collecting reviews on the platform to analyse and categorize them with consistency and real user reviews. A bibliographical research about consumer sleep technologies was also carried out. The technologies under evaluation include Oura, a sensor-equipped ring, Whoop, a sensor-equipped band and the Sleep as Android app. The results revealed issues regarding interface, synchronization and metrics.},

abstract = {This research aims to revolutionize the remote travel experience by addressing the lack of proactiveness of user often associated with virtual tours and pre-recorded videos. We propose a novel approach that utilizes a remote-controlled boat equipped with a 360-degree camera, stationed at popular coastal tourist destinations. This innovative setup enables users to engage in immersive experiences such as remote sightseeing, racing game simulations, and interactive fish feeding activities. During the development process, we encountered various challenges, including the selection of a suitable omnidirectional camera that balances quality, price, and compatibility with the boat's system. Ensuring low-latency communication between the user's device and the remote-controlled boat was also crucial for a seamless and responsive experience. Additionally, maintainability, battery operating time, and navigating regulatory requirements posed significant hurdles. To overcome these challenges, we implemented creative solutions. We opted for a compact digital camera capable of capturing 360-degree footage using the USB UVC protocol, striking a balance between image quality and affordability. We leveraged WebRTC protocol to achieve low-latency video streaming and control input transmission, minimizing perceptible delays and enhancing the user experience. To validate the effectiveness of our remote ship control system, we conducted an experiment using the Meta Quest 2 head-mounted display (HMD). Participants controlled the remote boat while immersed in the 360-degree video feed, experiencing the coastal environment as if they were physically present. The results confirmed the system's ability to deliver an immersive and engaging remote travel experience. Looking ahead, we aim to address challenges such as reducing boat rocking, enhancing the sense of presence through additional sensory feedback, and implementing collision avoidance and automatic return functions for the boat. By refining and optimizing the system, we strive to offer users a truly transformative remote travel experience that brings them closer to the wonders of coastal destinations worldwide.},

abstract = {In the modern industrial society, activities across various industrial sectors play a crucial role in driving economic growth and technological advancement. However, these activities inevitably involve risks to the safety and health of workers. Accidents and injuries at industrial sites not only threaten the lives and well-being of workers but also lead to decreased productivity, legal issues, and financial losses for companies. Among different industries, construction and manufacturing sectors account for the highest proportion of industrial accidents. These accidents often occur due to workers' carelessness and lack of awareness. This paper proposes a smart IoT safety platform to prevent safety accidents in construction and manufacturing sites. The smart IoT safety platform consists of IoT devices, network devices, and a control server. The IoT devices are designed to monitor various types of safety incidents, such as worker monitoring, entrapment accidents, gas leaks, collapses, and falls, using wearable or site-installed devices equipped with sensors like laser, IMU, gas, and cameras. The network devices include BLE Mesh installed on IoT devices and a LoRa Mesh network to transmit data to the control server. The control server collects and monitors data from the site and includes control functions to prevent safety accidents. The development of the smart IoT safety platform aims to create a safer work environment by preventing accidents and establishing a safety culture across the industry. This integration of advanced IoT technology in safety management is expected to significantly contribute to reducing industrial accidents and enhancing overall workplace safety.},

abstract = {In the era of big data, enterprises have higher and higher requirements for data security, especially when dealing with massive amounts of sensitive information in ERP systems, data security issues become particularly important. To address this challenge, In this paper, we propose a multi-layer encryption scheme based on a encrypted database, including device-level encryption, user-level encryption, table-level encryption, field-level encryption, and row-level authentication, aiming to protect the data information of the ERP system in a multi-dimensional way. To verify the effectiveness of the scheme, this paper applies it on the human resource data of the ERP system to ensure that the data storage, transmission, and access processes are in an encrypted state in the big data environment. In addition, this paper incorporates NL2SQL with Large Language Model(LLM) to realize conversational data analysis, generating SQL queries through natural language to cope with the complex and changing query requirements in the big data environment, and to enhance the flexibility and intelligence of data access. The research results show that the proposed multi-layer encryption scheme and conversational data analysis method not only significantly improves the data security of the ERP system in the big data environment, but also optimizes the efficiency of the enterprise in the process of big data analysis and retrieval, and mends the natural defects of the NL2SQL security protection, which guarantees the data security for the landing of LLM applications.},

However, as the health monitoring industry is still in its infancy, there are many problems in the professional knowledge, skill reserves, equipment use and logistics support of users. These issues lead to suboptimal health monitoring and can pose a threat to the health and safety of users. In this work, the health assessment of wearable sensor data acquisition and machine learning studied the discrimination method of integrating multi-source sensor signals and expert experience, and designed a two-stage anomaly recognition scheme. In the first stage, the discrimination rules containing expert experience were used to complete the preliminary discrimination of anomalies, and in the research of expert knowledge base, the representation and use of expert experience in wearable systems were discussed, and the construction method of anomaly discrimination knowledge base based on problems was designed and implemented. The Transformer model is used to process multi-source sensor signals, and its self-attention mechanism and timing expression characteristics are fully utilized, which greatly reduces the false negative rate of abnormal states. Experimental analysis shows that the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of health assessment.},

abstract = {In recent years, the rapid rise of Mixed Reality (MR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies has transformed digital interactions and immersive experiences, as evidenced by their widespread adoption in AR glasses, MR headsets, and mobile AR applications. However, integrating MR and AR into everyday life also presents unique problems, particularly concerning user interactions within limited visual fields and discomfort caused by prolonged arm elevation. To address these challenges, our research introduces an innovative input device utilizing common wearable device magnetometer sensors and a strong magnet as input controls. We employ innovative methods to eliminate environmental magnetic field and soft magnetic offset, achieving trajectory restoration with an error margin of 5.23 mm through machine learning and trajectory smoothing algorithms. This enables our input device to interact with MR and AR devices beyond the user’s visual range, expanding operational space, and enhancing usability.},

abstract = {In recent years, traditional convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformer models have been widely used in industrial fault diagnosis. This paper proposes a new lightweight fault diagnosis framework, Sim-ConvFormer, to address the issues of high model complexity and stringent hardware requirements. The Sim-ConvFormer framework integrates SimAM and External Attention. SimAM enhances the model's sensitivity to detailed signal changes by capturing locally significant features at different scales. External Attention, contrasting with self-attention, improves generalization by calculating the affinity between input features and two external learning memories shared by the entire dataset, thereby capturing global context information. The synergy of these technologies not only preserves their individual advantages but also enhances the model's robustness and accuracy in handling various faults. Experiments on three different mechanical systems demonstrate Sim-ConvFormer's superior fault diagnosis performance, particularly in terms of model lightness and diagnostic robustness compared to existing Transformer and CNN-based methods. These results indicate that Sim-ConvFormer is an effective fault diagnosis tool suitable for deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments.},

With the develop of artificial intelligent and information technology, wearable medical devices have made rapid development in the diagnosis and treatment of PD on the basis of traditional diagnostic treatment methods. According to the main symptoms and judgment criteria of PD, wearable medical devices are divided into two categories: monitoring type and treatment type. The monitoring type is mainly to use various sensors to collect and organize data on biological signals for PD, such as tremor, postural gait, muscle rigidity and bradykinesia. On this basis, the treatment devices can provide real-time treatment methods to reduce the disease.

abstract = {Sandplay is an effective psychotherapy for mental retreatment, and many people prefer to engage in sandplay in Virtual Reality (VR) due to its convenience. Haptic perception of physical objects and miniatures enhances the realism and immersion in VR. Previous studies have rendered sizes by exerting pressure on the user’s fingertips or employing tangible, shape-changing devices. However, these interfaces are limited by the physical shapes they can assume, making it difficult to simulate objects that grow larger or smaller than the interface. Motivated by literature on visual-haptic illusions, this work aims to convey the haptic sensation of a virtual object’s shape to the user by exploring the relationships between the haptic feedback from real objects and their visual renderings in VR. Our study focuses on the confirmation and adjustment ratios for different virtual object sizes. The results show that the likelihood of participants confirming the correct size of virtual cubes decreases as the object size increases, requiring more adjustments for larger objects. This research provides valuable insights into the relationships between haptic sensations and visual inputs, contributing to the understanding of visual-haptic illusions in VR environments.},

abstract = {In scenarios where a seller holds sensitive data x, like employee / patient records or ecological data, and a buyer seeks to obtain an evaluation of specific function f on this data, solutions in trustless digital environments like blockchain-based Web3 systems typically fall into two categories: (1) Smart contract-powered solutions and (2) cryptographic solutions leveraging tools such as adaptor signatures. The former approach offers atomic transactions where the buyer learns the function evaluation f(x) (and not x entirely) upon payment. However, this approach is often inefficient, costly, lacks privacy for the seller's data, and is incompatible with systems that do not support smart contracts with required functionalities. In contrast, the adaptor signature-based approach addresses all of the above issues but comes with an "all-or-nothing" guarantee, where the buyer fully extracts x and does not support functional extraction of the sensitive data. In this work, we aim to bridge the gap between these approaches, developing a solution that enables fair functional sales of information while offering improved efficiency, privacy, and compatibility similar to adaptor signatures.Towards this, we propose functional adaptor signatures (FAS) a novel cryptographic primitive that achieves all the desired properties as listed above. Using FAS, the seller can publish an advertisement committing to x. The buyer can pre-sign the payment transaction w.r.t. a function f, and send it along with the transaction to the seller. The seller adapts the pre-signature into a valid (buyer's) signature and posts the payment and the adapted signature on the blockchain to get paid. Finally, using the pre-signature and the posted signature, the buyer efficiently extracts f(x), and completes the sale. We formalize the security properties of FAS, among which is a new notion called witness privacy to capture seller's privacy, which ensures the buyer does not learn anything beyond f(x). We present multiple variants of witness privacy, namely, witness hiding, witness indistinguishability, and zero-knowledge, to capture varying levels of leakage about x beyond f(x) to a malicious buyer.We introduce two efficient constructions of FAS supporting linear functions (like statistics/aggregates, kernels in machine learning, etc.), that satisfy the strongest notion of witness privacy. One construction is based on prime-order groups and compatible with Schnorr signatures for payments, and the other is based on lattices and compatible with a variant of Lyubashevsky's signature scheme. A central conceptual contribution of our work lies in revealing a surprising connection between functional encryption, a well-explored concept over the past decade, and adaptor signatures, a relatively new primitive in the cryptographic landscape. On a technical level, we avoid heavy cryptographic machinery and achieve improved efficiency, by making black-box use of building blocks like inner product functional encryption (IPFE) while relying on certain security-enhancing techniques for the IPFE in a non-black-box manner. We implement our FAS construction for Schnorr signatures and show that for reasonably sized seller witnesses, the different operations are quite efficient even for commodity hardware.},

abstract = {After over a decade of intensive research, wireless sensing technology is nearing commercialization. However, the inherent openness of the wireless medium exposes this technology to security flaws and vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce RISiren to reveal the risk. RISiren is a pioneering end-to-end black-box attack system leveraging programmable metasurface with a high level of stealthiness. The key insight of RISiren lies in its ability to generate malicious multipath using metasurface, thereby disrupting wireless channel metrics influenced by genuine human activities and facilitating malicious attacks. To ensure the effectiveness of RISiren, we propose a novel metasurface configuration strategy aiming at creating human-like activities that stem from a comprehensive analysis of how human activities impact wireless signal propagation. We have implemented and validated RISiren using commercial Wi-Fi devices. Our evaluation involved testing our attack strategies against five state-of-the-art systems (including five different types of recognition frameworks) representative of the current landscape. The experimental results show that the adversarial wireless signals generated by RISiren achieve over 90\% attack success rate on average, and remain robust and effective across different environments and deployment setups, including through wall attack scenarios.},

abstract = {Most cryptographic protocols model a player's knowledge of secrets in a simple way. Informally, the player knows a secret in the sense that she can directly furnish it as a (private) input to a protocol, e.g., to digitally sign a message.  The growing availability of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and multiparty computation (MPC), however, undermines this model of knowledge. Such tools can encumber a secret sk and permit a chosen player to access sk conditionally, without actually knowing sk. By permitting selective access to sk by an adversary, encumbrance of secrets can enable vote-selling in cryptographic voting schemes, illegal sale of credentials for online services, and erosion of deniability in anonymous messaging systems. Unfortunately, existing proof-of-knowledge protocols fail to demonstrate that a secret is unencumbered. We therefore introduce and formalize a new notion called complete knowledge (CK). A proof (or argument) of CK shows that a prover does not just know a secret, but also has fully unencumbered knowledge, i.e., unrestricted ability to use the secret.  We introduce two practical CK schemes that use special-purpose hardware, specifically TEEs and off-the-shelf mining ASICs. We prove the security of these schemes and explore their practical deployment with a complete, open-source, end-to-end prototype with smart-contract verification that supports both. We show how CK can address encumbrance attacks identified in previous work. Finally, we introduce two new applications enabled by CK that involve proving ownership of blockchain assets.},

abstract = {Existing defense approaches against sensor spoofing attacks suffer from the limitations of limited specific attack types, requiring GPU computation, exhibiting considerable detection latency and struggling with the interpretability of corner cases. We developed PhyScout, a holistic sensor spoofing defense framework to overcome the above limitations. Our framework capitalizes on the observation that human drivers can rapidly and accurately identify spoofing attacks by performing spatio-temporal consistency checks of their environment. We commence by defining the generalized conflicts that different sensor spoofing attacks produce regarding the spatio-temporal consistency. These conflicts are subsequently unified and formalized through a least squares problem approach. This process is modeled using image-based feature point extraction and matching techniques, followed by the design of a risk identification method for each conflict.We evaluate PhyScout across various environments, including simulators, datasets, and real-world scenarios. Compared to existing defense solutions, PhyScout offers rapid identification of sensor attacks (within 100ms) with low performance overhead (CPU-based), and conflict visualization. It demonstrates a fresh paradigm in autonomous vehicle security and presents new avenues for future research in robust and efficient defense mechanisms against sensor spoofing attacks.

abstract = {Recently, due to the continued reduction in DNA sequencing cost, large-scale genetic samples are being gathered for accelerating predispositions to specific diseases, tailoring treatment of efficient drugs and therapies, and the like. Massive genetic samples are encrypted-and-then-delegated to a public cloud to both save investment and maintenance costs and prevent the potential leakage of sensitive information. However, such a manner compromises the serviceability of a public cloud, since encryption inevitably breaks the semantic information of genetic samples. Secure count query of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as a kernel component for GWASs and related genomic analysis, is attracting much more attention.Existing methods lack provable security, suffer low efficiency caused by multiple interactions with the cloud, and so on. In this paper, a secure virtual CT-Tree (secure vCT-Tree) is carefully constructed to confuse the tree structure by introducing a hash function and a Paillier system. Furthermore, by delegating the secure vCT-Tree to the cloud, concrete models (i.e., SecCT and SecCT+) are presented to resolve secure count query problems on the fly. SecCT+ is a solution based on trusted execution environment while SecCT is a pure software solution. Both models advance the provable security of genetic research and are proven to be secure under the adaptive chosen keyword (query) attack (IND-CKA2) model. Furthermore, massive experiments are evaluated on realistic data to show the superiority of SecCT and SecCT+.},

abstract = {3D object detection with omnidirectional views enables safety-critical applications such as mobile robot navigation. Such applications increasingly operate on resource-constrained edge devices, facilitating reliable processing without privacy concerns or network delays. To enable cost-effective deployment, cameras have been widely adopted as a low-cost alternative to LiDAR sensors. However, the compute-intensive workload to achieve high performance of camera-based solutions remains challenging due to the computational limitations of edge devices. In this paper, we present Panopticus, a carefully designed system for omnidirectional and camera-based 3D detection on edge devices. Panopticus employs an adaptive multi-branch detection scheme that accounts for spatial complexities. To optimize the accuracy within latency limits, Panopticus dynamically adjusts the model's architecture and operations based on available edge resources and spatial characteristics. We implemented Panopticus on three edge devices and conducted experiments across real-world environments based on the public self-driving dataset and our mobile 360° camera dataset. Experiment results showed that Panopticus improves accuracy by 62\% on average given the strict latency objective of 33ms. Also, Panopticus achieves a 2.1\texttimes{} latency reduction on average compared to baselines.},

abstract = {The smart buildings of the future need to understand the movement and occupancy of the people in the environment. Using cameras to provide this context can be privacy-invasive. Alternatively, installing dedicated hardware to sense the environment can be cost-prohibitive and limit ubiquitous adoption. WiFi-based sensing has hence been championed to provide this building-scale sensing, as it allows for both privacy and is ubiquitously deployed in most buildings. However, industry-translatable research in this space has been challenging as no building-scale systems can provide WiFi sensing data. Consequently, many real-world challenges of deploying these sensing systems remain a mystery. To overcome this veil of mystery, we develop and open-source WiSenseHub, a building-scale WiFi-sensing system. We build our system on commercially available WiFi radios, deploy our backend services to collect data on infinitely scalable AWS cloud or a local server desktop, and build a front-end phone-based interface to collect diverse WiFi sensing data. We deployed multiple WiFi radios in our building and collected data for user devices for over 38 hours.},

In this paper, we introduce SiWiS, a new approach to integrate radio sensing capabilities into individual WiFi devices for fine-grained human activity detection. SiWiS comprises two main components: (i) a new hardware component that can be easily installed on an off-the-shelf WiFi device, and (ii) a dual-branch deep neural network (DNN) optimized for concurrent human mask segmentation and pose estimation. We have built a prototype of SiWiS and installed it on a commercial WiFi router for evaluation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate a significant performance improvement over WiFi channel state information (CSI) based sensing methods. More importantly, zero-shot experiments confirm that SiWiS can be directly transferred to unseen real-world environments.},

Understanding and managing soil carbon levels is essential for sustainable agriculture and environmental protection. However, current methods for measuring soil carbon are time-consuming and costly, hindering efforts to monitor soil health and increase carbon sequestration. In this paper, we propose Scarf, a novel soil carbon sensing approach that combines widely accessible radio frequency (RF) and optical signals to detect soil carbon contents without dedicated hardware. Our key insight is that soil carbon content closely correlates with two indicators: the effective permittivity derived from RF signals and soil lightness determined from soil surface images. We mathematically model the correlations and leverage the non-linear correlation between the two signal modalities to compute soil carbon content. We employ machine learning to model relationships that cannot be captured by traditional mathematical equations. Our experimental results indicate that Scarf can achieve high soil carbon prediction accuracy that is comparable to the state-of-the-art soil carbon sensing techniques which cost US$1000s.},

abstract = {Human external biofluid (e.g., sweat, urine) contains vast health data that is readily harvestable. Currently, wearable sweat sensors require an electrochemical-based approach that is used in single use, creating environmental pollution as people track their exercise in the wild. Moreover, such solution relies on a battery-powered design, which brings battery health and thermal related issues. We present MetaBioLiq, a 3D printed wireless-readable sweat sensing system that offers continuous monitoring, featuring completely passive, environmentally friendly, and easily accessible. MetaBioLiq is developed upon sweat liquid's resonance upon high frequency RF interaction, with different sweat content driving RF resonance characteristics. To activate such resonance, we design 3D PolyLactic Acid (PLA) structures that capture e-field energy from the air, and tunneling it to the sweat. Once the resonance effect occurs, we analyze return signal from a wireless RF receiver to decouple the sweat's resonance. Lastly, we evaluate MetaBioLiq's performance with 24 artificial sweat samples containing different levels of glucose, electrolytes, and fat. MetaBioLiq proves its effectiveness with 95\% liquid level detection performance, and 96\% sweat liquid identification performance. We further investigate MetaBioLiq's robustness and reliability, as well as limitations. Overall, MetaBioLiq shows promising results to expand the realm of mobile continuous sensing to microscopic realm untangible in the past.},

abstract = {Mobile health (mHealth) apps have gained popularity over the past decade for patient health monitoring, yet their potential for timely intervention is underutilized due to limited integration with electronic health records (EHR) systems. Current EHR systems lack real-time monitoring capabilities for symptoms, medication adherence, physical and social functions, and community integration. Existing systems typically rely on static, in-clinic measures rather than dynamic, real-time patient data. This highlights the need for automated, scalable, and human-centered platforms to integrate patient-generated health data (PGHD) within EHR. Incorporating PGHD in a user-friendly format can enhance patient symptom surveillance, ultimately improving care management and post-surgical outcomes. To address this barrier, we have developed an mHealth platform, ROAMMEHR, to capture real-time sensor data and Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) using a smartwatch. The ROAMM-EHR platform can capture data from a consumer smartwatch, send captured data to a secure server, and display information within the Epic EHR system using a user-friendly interface, thus enabling healthcare providers to monitor post-surgical symptoms effectively.},

abstract = {Rural Internet of Things (IoT) systems connect sensors and actuators in remote areas, serving crucial roles in agriculture and environmental monitoring. Given the absence of networking infrastructure for backhaul in these regions, satellite IoT techniques offer a cost-effective solution for connectivity. However, current satellite IoT architectures often struggle to deliver high performance due to temporal and spatial link challenges. This paper presents SateRIoT, a new network architecture with temporal link estimation and spatial link sharing that fully exploits the capability of space low-cost low-earth-orbit (LEO) IoT satellites and ground low-power wide area (LPWA) IoT techniques in rural areas. First, we introduce a bursty link model that predicts the number of transmittable packets within a transmission window, reducing energy waste from failed uplink transmissions. Moreover, we enhance the model by selecting informative features and optimizing the window length. Additionally, we develop a multi-hop flooding protocol that enables gateways to buffer and share data packets across the network while incorporating a priority data queue to avoid duplicate transmissions. We implement SateRIoT with commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) IoT satellite and LoRa radios, then evaluate its performance based on real deployment and real-world collected traces. The results show that SateRIoT can consume 3.3X less energy consumption for an individual gateway. Moreover, SateRIoT offers up to a 5.6X reduction in latency for a single packet and a 1.9X enhancement in throughput.},

abstract = {Humanoid robots with dexterous hands have gained significant attention due to their manipulation capabilities. Recent advancements are driven by large-scale real robot data and teleoperation technology, enabling precise operation demonstrations and smooth trajectories. Common methods like virtual reality devices, cameras, wearable gloves, and custom hardware face the inability to capture real information about human-object contact, such as tactile information. In this study, we present HandySense, a multimodal system integrating visual, tactile, motion, and spatial perception for robust and comprehensive two-handed manipulation tracking. HandySense includes RGB-D cameras, visual-inertial tracking cameras, and a motion capture glove with fingertip tactile sensors. Our framework achieved 99.45\% accuracy in classifying 12 task stages, exhibiting the potential for large-scale human demonstration data collection and representing a pivotal step towards empowering humanoid robots to execute complex manipulations.},

abstract = {Environment sensing is a fundamental task in mobile augmented reality (AR). However, on-device sensing and computing resources often limit mobile AR sensing capability, making high-quality environment sensing challenging to achieve. In recent years, in-context sensing, a new sensing system design paradigm, has emerged with the promise of achieving accurate, efficient, and robust sensing results. In this work, we first formally define the in-context sensing design paradigm. We summarize its primary challenges as the uncertainty of environmental information availability. To quantify the impact of sensing context data, we present two in-depth case studies that show how it can impact different aspects of mobile AR sensing systems.},

abstract = {Mixed-reality headsets offer new ways to perceive our environment. They employ visible spectrum cameras to capture and display the environment on screens in front of the user's eyes. However, these cameras lead to limitations. Firstly, they capture only a partial view of the environment. They are positioned to capture whatever is in front of the user, thus creating blind spots during complete immersion and failing to detect events outside the restricted field of view. Secondly, they capture only visible light fields, ignoring other fields like acoustics and radio that are also present in the environment. Finally, these power-hungry cameras rapidly deplete the mixed-reality headset's battery. We introduce PixelGen to rethink embedded cameras for mixed-reality headsets. PixelGen proposes to decouple cameras from the mixed-reality headset and balance resolution and fidelity to minimize the power consumption. It employs low-resolution, monochrome image sensors and environmental sensors to capture the surroundings around the headset. This approach reduces the system's communication bandwidth and power consumption. A transformer-based language and image model process this information to overcome resolution trade-offs, thus generating a higher-resolution representation of the environment. We present initial experiments that show PixelGen's viability.},

abstract = {Detection and assessment of micro vibrations are crucial tasks in both industrial settings and daily life. However, vibration sensors attached to the target vibrator may introduce potential resonance, and wireless detection methods suffer from severe multipath interference. Fortunately, moir\'{e}-based sensing methods have gained recognition in recent years due to their ability to perceive micro motion changes. In this paper, we propose Moir\'{e}Vib, a micro-vibration detection solution based on moir\'{e} patterns for dynamic and high-frequency environments. We attach a printed marker with periodic gratings to the surface of vibration devices to generate moir\'{e} patterns, which can amplify micro vibrations due to their low-frequency magnification effect. However, moir\'{e} pattern's changes caused by micro vibrations are often overwhelmed by random pixel-level noises, and the limited frame rate of the camera fails to capture high-frequency moir\'{e} features. To deal with these problems, we propose a spectrum-based method to refine and enhance the dynamic and micro moir\'{e} features. Additionally, we propose a dual-frame-rate-based fusion mechanism to realize high-frequency reconstruction of moir\'{e} features. Extensive experimental results show that Moir\'{e}Vib can realize a median amplitude detection error of 4.37 μm and achieve frequency detection up to 300Hz with a frame rate range of 10~30 fps.},
