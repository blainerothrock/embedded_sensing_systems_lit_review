abstract = {With the increasing importance of privacy protection and the growing risks of cloud data leakage and tampering, application and data security have received extensive attention, which is even more necessary for sensitive applications such as identity authentication, multi-party data collaboration, and online financial service system. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) can ensure the security of the code and data running in it. Still, the security of the persistent data needs to be guaranteed by the software in the TEE. This paper presents QuickStorage, a storage system that enables sensitive applications running in TEEs to store data safely and efficiently transparently. QuickStorage draws on the idea of the log-structured storage system. Compared with the previous system, the I/O performance of QuickStorage has been dramatically improved through the new design. We implement QuickStorage on the Intel hardware platform and provide two compaction policies, the classic compaction policy and the leveled compaction policy, for log-structured merge-trees (LSMT) in the index area. We conducted intensive tests on systems using two compaction policies to demonstrate the different advantages of compaction policies. The results show that no matter which LSMT compaction policy is adopted by the storage system, write performance is an order of magnitude improvement compared with the previous storage system. Moreover, the overall read performance is also good. The two compaction policies have various advantages and disadvantages in reading and writing, allowing upper-layer applications to choose a more suitable one to meet their various application scenarios.},

abstract = {Large-scale and fine-grained evaluations of spatial quality are made possible by the introduction and growth of multi-source big data. The spatial analysis method, visual semantic segmentation method, and field measurement method are used to construct a spatial quality evaluation system for urban sunken plazas based on the multi-source Spatio-temporal data, fusing urban road network data, Baidu API data, street view image data, POI data, public review data, and field measurement data. Based on the results of the spatial quality evaluation, the spatial quality measurement and effectiveness are achieved by. The evaluation suggests optimization steps to achieve effective measurement of spatial quality based on the findings of the evaluation of spatial quality and the existing state of spatial construction. The findings demonstrate that Tianjin Mingyuan Square has some fundamental construction in terms of visual, sensory, and use experience. Its space construction is also evenly distributed, and its aesthetic, comfortable, and functional construction is better, but its construction in terms of completeness is relatively subpar. In order to improve the spatial quality of the sunken plaza and encourage its effective and healthy development, we suggest optimization approaches to enhance the spatial landscape, increase the spatial facilities, and optimize the spatial environment.},

abstract = {Compound faults often occur in mechanical systems under complex and variable operating conditions, which can seriously affect the health level of mechanical systems, so it is crucial to study the decoupling diagnosis of compound faults. In addition, industrial big data can greatly boost the accuracy and reliability of fault diagnosis results. Therefore, based on data fusion and attention mechanism, we propose a new composite fault diagnosis method called decoupling Transformer with convolutional fusion (DTCF). First, we construct the input embedding sequence as the model input. Second, the multichannel sensor data are adaptively fused using a convolutional layer. Then, the encoder encodes the signal based on global self-attention, which is representation learning. Finally, the decoupler iteratively generates decoupled labels. Two compound fault datasets are used, including the gearbox dataset and the bearing dataset, experiments on which show that the proposed method has higher accuracy, better generalization ability on the smaller training dataset, and stronger robustness against noise than CNN-based or MLP-based models. In addition, the visual analysis of attention weights makes the model interpretable.},

However, its intermittent nature and the stochastic grid environment pose operational and technical challenges, increasing complexity for a secure and reliable grid operation and planning. In this regard, the need for harvesting potential energy from an intermittent source without compromising the actual grid infrastructure and operation is crucial. Thus, this work proposes a novel probabilistic framework for PV hosting capacity assessment and enhancement considering the voltage and current probabilistic restrictions as well as PV inverter power factor control. This work uses the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm that embeds the probabilistic approach based on Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). A sensitivity analysis of the PSO parameters was performed to achieve the best possible results. Tests in the IEEE 33-bus radial distribution system with four PV units with power factor control yield a more realistic PV hosting capacity.},

Although there are existing systems that detect fire and monitor the presence of people in indoor areas, research on their implementation in embedded platforms is limited. This article introduces an ultra-low-power embedded system for fire detection and crowd counting using efficient deep learning methods. For the prediction of fire occurrences, environmental and gas sensor along with multilayer perceptron nodes are used. For crowd counting, a custom lightweight version of YOLOv5 is introduced, using an architecture based on ShuffleNetV2, resulting in a model with low memory requirements, high accuracy predictions, and fast inference on an embedded platform. The accuracy, power consumption, and memory requirements of the proposed system are evaluated using public datasets and datasets acquired by the environmental and image sensors, and its performance is compared to that of existing approaches.},

abstract = {With the ever-increasing virtualization of software and hardware, the privacy of user-sensitive data is a fundamental concern in computation outsourcing. Secure processors enable a trusted execution environment to guarantee security properties based on the principles of isolation, sealing, and integrity. However, the shared hardware resources within the microarchitecture are increasingly being used by co-located adversarial software to create timing-based side-channel attacks. State-of-the-art secure processors implement the strong isolation primitive to enable non-interference for shared hardware but suffer from frequent state purging and resource utilization overheads, leading to degraded performance. This article proposes ASM, an adaptive secure multicore architecture that enables a reconfigurable, yet strongly isolated execution environment. For outsourced security-critical processes, the proposed security kernel and hardware extensions allow either a given process to execute using all available cores or co-execute multiple processes on strongly isolated clusters of cores. This spatio-temporal execution environment is configured based on resource demands of processes, such that the secure processor mitigates state purging overheads and maximizes hardware resource utilization.},

abstract = {The real-time gait phase of human lower extremity is the foundation for wearable robots to provide precise and complex assistance strategies in human-robot interaction. In addition to strengths in estimation performance, it is crucial to make the devices portable and user-friendly that can drive the adoption in the unstructured environments. In this paper, we present an online continuous gait phase estimation system based on multi-source flexible sensors that address this issue. Specifically, we utilize two soft bend sensors mounted around the hip joint and a set of flexible pressure sensors mounted on the bottom of the foot to track the real-time motion of the lower limbs. The adaptive nonlinear frequency oscillators (ANFOs) are used to couple with the captured motion to generate a sequential, linearly growing gait phase. Moreover, heel strike events are detected to calculate phase shift and synchronize the phase with practical action. A uniform walking experiment validates the performance of the proposed method. The experiment results demonstrate that our approach could provide accurate gait phase information and has the potential to improve the interaction transparency of exoskeleton robots in the future.},

To give full play to the kinematic ability of the two wheel-leg robot, the terrain adaptation ability of the leg structure and the control ability of the upper layer autonomous navigation system, the multi-mode control method of the robot and the path planning and autonomous navigation in indoor environment are studied in this paper. Firstly, based on the simulation physics platform, the kinematic transfer relationship of distributed model was proposed, the kinematic model of the wheel-leg subsystem and the two wheel-leg system was established, and the full-drive dynamic model with the wheel-leg-torso interaction force as the end output force was established. Then, a distributed control framework with torso postures as task space was proposed to plan the torso force and joint torque of the body in layers. The proposed walking and jumping motion planner of the two wheel-leg system and the multi-mode state machine are integrated with the control frame to realize the wheeled walking and jumping smooth control of the sagittal plane wheel-leg coordination. Finally, the ROS software framework based RGB-D visual sensor SLAM local environment awareness system is used to convert the point cloud map into an octree map, and then the oblique projection principle is converted into a two-dimensional raster map. A * algorithm and TEB algorithm are respectively used for global and local path planning. Finally, the autonomous navigation ability of the two wheel-leg robot in indoor dynamic environment is realized.},

In this study, we developed and realized the physical prototype of SRLs which has a 4-DOFs robotic limb mounted on the waist, and a simulation platform is also developed for this SRLs. Moreover, in order to establish the relationship between the prototype and semi-physical simulation, this study constructed the limb-mapping control system of semi-physical simulation for the SRLs based on the kinematic model. Each joint of SRLs can achieve the one-one mapping relationship with the semi-physical simulation through the established forward and inverse kinematic model based on the screw theory. Meanwhile, this paper also constructed the limb-mapping control system of semi-physical simulation for the SRLs, it established the motion relationship with a robotic limb of SRLs and the human upper limb via the sensor measurement.

abstract = {With the development of science and technology, people have made new progress in the exploration of the ocean. In order to study the ocean in greater depth, implementation monitoring of the ocean is required. Due to the complex underwater communication environment, underwater information data collection is more difficult compared to land, and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are often needed to assist in the collection. How to plan the cruise path of AUVs is a major problem in data collection. To address this problem, a hybrid optimization algorithm based on k-means clustering algorithm is proposed in this paper, which can plan multiple AUVs for data collection. After simulation experiments, the effectiveness of the algorithm is determined. Compared with the SOM-based (Self-Organizing Map) algorithm, the length of the planned path and the algorithm response time of this algorithm are better than the SOM-based algorithm, which can save energy for AUVs and extend the life of sensors.},

The saturation of public resources for mental health services necessitates the exploration of alternative means to provide optimal support for affected individuals.

Through the use of sensory information, smart devices, such as smart watches and mobile phones, equipped with properly trained autonomous agents can reliably provide users with appropriate responses. Nevertheless, it is crucial to comprehend the limitations of these systems and their learning methodologies to instill confidence in their autonomy among users.

abstract = {Many mobile applications have resorted to deep neural networks (DNNs) because of their strong inference capabilities. Since both input data and DNN architectures could be sensitive, there is an increasing demand for secure DNN execution on mobile devices. Towards this end, hardware-based trusted execution environments on mobile devices (mobile TEEs), such as ARM TrustZone, have recently been exploited to execute CNN securely. However, running entire DNNs on mobile TEEs is challenging as TEEs have stringent resource and performance constraints. In this work, we develop a novel mobile TEE-based security framework that can efficiently execute the entire DNN in a resource-constrained mobile TEE with minimal inference time overhead. Specifically, we propose a progressive pruning to gradually identify and remove the redundant neurons from a DNN while maintaining a high inference accuracy. Next, we develop a memory optimization method to deallocate the memory storage of the pruned neurons utilizing the low-level programming technique. Finally, we devise a novel adaptive partitioning method that divides the pruned model into multiple partitions according to the available memory in the mobile TEE and loads the partitions into the mobile TEE separately with a minimal loading time overhead. Our experiments with various DNNs and open-source datasets demonstrate that we can achieve 2-30 times less inference time with comparable accuracy compared to existing approaches securing entire DNNs with mobile TEE.},

As a familiar wearable device, headphones offer a compelling site for head-situated interaction and sensing. Using emerging sensing modalities such as inertial motion, capacitive touch sensing, and depth cameras, our implemented prototypes explore sensing and interaction techniques that offer a range of compelling capabilities. User scenarios include context-aware privacy, gestural audio-visual control, and co-opting natural body language as context to drive animated avatars for "camera-off" scenarios in remote work–or to co-opt (oft-subconscious) head movements such as dodging attacks in video games to enhance the gameplay experience. Drawing from literature and other frameworks, we situate our prototypes and related techniques in a design space across the dual dimensions of (1) type of input (touch, mid-air, or head orientation); and (2) the context of user action (application, body, or environment). In particular, interactions that combine multiple inputs and contexts at the same time offer a rich design space of headphone-situated wearable interactions and sensing techniques.},

However, microbe-embedded artefacts present a challenge of temporal dissonance, reflected by a “time lag” typically experienced by humans in noticing the gradual and minute shifts in microbial metabolism. This could compromise fluency of interactions and may hinder timely noticing and attending to microbes in living artefacts. In addressing this challenge, we introduce Cyano-chromic Interface, in which photosynthetic activity of cyanobacteria (Synechocystis sp. PCC6803) is timely surfaced by an electrochromic (EC) material through its monochromatic display. Grounded through interface performance characterization and design primitives, we developed application concepts through which we instantiate how the interface can be tuned for diverse functional and experiential outcomes in living artefacts. We further discuss the potential of aligning human-microbe temporalities for enriched interactions and reciprocal relationships with microbes, and beyond.},

abstract = {Access to nature and feeling connection is critical for mental health and well-being. These benefits may be mediated by self-transcendent emotions evoked by nature. We need to explore the capacity of technology to offer such experiences when we lack access to the restorative power of nature. Despite growing research validating this capacity, there is a lack of articulated design knowledge of how such experiences can be created. Here, we explore a technologically-mediated support for mental well-being through an agile design approach informed by self-transcendent emotion theory and transformative experience design. We developed Awedyssey as a sensory deprivation countermeasure experience in virtual reality (VR) and as a part of a public exhibition. We gathered qualitative feedback through interviews, diaries, and surveys. From this data we identified design tensions for designing complex emotional experiences when considering the diversity of individuals and dual effects of designing for realism, autonomy, vastness, and comfort.},

abstract = {Despite the prevalence of GPS services, they still suffer from intermittent positioning with poor accuracy in partially shadowed regions like urban canyons, flyover shadows, and factories' indoor areas. Existing wisdom relies on hardware modifications of GPS receivers or power-hungry infrastructures requiring continuous plug-in power supply which is hard to provide in outdoor regions and some factories. This paper fills the gap with GPSMirror, the first GPS-strengthening system that works for unmodified smartphones with the assistance of newly-designed GPS backscatter tags. The key enabling techniques in GPSMirror include: (i) a meticulous hardware design with microwatt-level power consumption that pushes the limit of backscatter sensitivity to re-radiate extremely weak GPS signals with enough coverage approaching the regulation limit; and (ii) a novel GPS positioning algorithm achieving meter-level accuracy in shadowed regions as well as expanding locatable regions under inadequate satellites where conventional algorithms fail. We build a prototype of the GPSMirror tags and conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate them. Our results show that a GPSMirror tag can provide coverage up to 27.7 m. GPSMirror achieves median positioning accuracy of 3.7 m indoors and 4.6 m in urban canyon environments, respectively.},

abstract = {IoT uplink performance is crucial for a wide variety of IoT applications such as health sensing and industrial control, which demand reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud. However, due to the limited transmission power budget imposed on many power-constrained IoT devices, IoT uplinks are highly susceptible to cross-technology interference (CTI) caused by coexisting networks. Previous approaches to mitigating CTI have relied on MAC/PHY designs. They suffer from poor performance and limited generality in the presence of wideband CTI sources such as Wi-Fi and RF jammer, which transmit aggressively on large spectrum chunks using diverse radio technologies.This paper introduces RF-SIFTER, a general and highly-effective system that protects low-power IoT uplinks against intensive wideband CTI. RF-SIFTER enables technology-agnostic blind beamforming to sift signals based on bandwidth, allowing IoT signals to pass through while rejecting interference wider than the IoT band. RF-SIFTER is designed as a Layer-0.5 that is transparent to IoT MAC/PHY, ensuring general applicability and practical deployability across a wide range of coexistence scenarios. RF-SIFTER is implemented on an FPGA-based software radio platform. Extensive experiments show that RF-SIFTER can improve the SINR of IoT uplink signals by up to 29 dB and increase packet delivery ratio by 2\texttimes{} to 5\texttimes{} for ZigBee, BLE, and RFID in the presence of wideband CTI caused by 802.11ac networks and RF jamming.},

abstract = {Sensor networks are increasingly commonplace in visions of smart cities and future healthcare systems, promising greater efficiency and increased wellbeing. However, the design of these technologies remains focused on specific users and fragmented by context, overlooking the diversity of needs, wants and values present when technologies, people, and lived realities interact within instrumented spaces. In this paper we present a workshop method – Sensing Care – that can help researchers, interdisciplinary design and development teams, and potentially affected users, to explore what it takes to design for living with sensor technologies that intersect and interact across private and public spaces, through speculative scenarios and role play. Drawing from three deployments of the workshop, we discuss how this approach supports the design of future care-oriented sensor networks, and helps designers understand what it means to live with complex technologies as people traverse diverse contexts.},

abstract = {Exercise benefits people not only in physical health but also in mental health. Compared to individual workouts, many people prefer group exercise because of the additional peer support like guidance from experienced peers, and socializing benefits like the opportunities to meet new friends when exercising with others as a group. However, during the pandemic, many group exercise sessions were shifted from in-person to online through video conferencing platforms. Such change significantly decreased the exercise feedback and social signals that participants could receive during the exercise, such as the immediate self-checking with a studio mirror, the group movement calibration with co-exercisers, and the sense of social presence (i.e., the existence of other co-exercisers) in the small community. To address these challenges, we present ZoombaTogether, a video platform add-on that enhances the remote Zumba dancing experience with on-the-fly pose detection and visualization techniques. It tracks and evaluates how well remote dancers follow the instructor with minor latency and provide them with visual feedback to simulate a joint exercise experience with group members. ZoombaTogether&nbsp;visualizes the participants’ performance at both individual and group levels to help them understand their movement similarity to the instructor and other dancers with a set of extensible visualization modules. Meanwhile, ZoombaTogether&nbsp;addresses the participants’ privacy concerns by supporting on-device computer vision-based body posture estimation so that they could keep their personal video private from other group members. In this work, we provide a solution to use visual feedback as a communication channel for exercise participants and demonstrate the possibility of enhancing the online group exercise experience. We encourage the community to carry on our work and explore solutions to the challenges of missing social signals in online group exercises.},

abstract = {About half a billion households are expected to use smart home systems by 2025. Although many IoT sensors, such as smoke detectors or security cameras, are available and governmental crisis warning systems are in place, little is known about how to warn appropriately in smart home environments. We created a Raspberry Pi based prototype with a speaker, a display, and a connected smart light bulb. Together with a focus group, we developed a taxonomy for warning messages in smart home environments, dividing them into five classes with different stimuli. We evaluated the taxonomy using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) in a field study at participants’ (N = 13) homes testing 331 warnings. The results show that taxonomy-based warning stimuli are perceived to be appropriate and participants could imagine using such a warning system. We propose a deeper integration of warning capabilities into smart home environments to enhance the safety of citizens.},

abstract = {NugiTex is a line of interactive, affective wearable garments that convey the embodied experience of plants using device-initiated haptic cues. The haptic cues reflect a plant’s “comfort” level based on proximal environmental conditions, aiming to increase awareness and induce feelings of closeness, symbiosis, and empathy with the user’s natural environment. Composed of inflatable silicone and non-elastic textile layers, NugiTex responds to nearby atmospheric conditions such as temperature and humidity levels, which are measured in real-time by AirSpec, smart eyeglasses fitted with sensors to collect environmental data. Variations in temperature and humidity in a room are then interpreted and translated into three types of haptic cues - shrinking, hard pushing, and mild pushing - each a metaphorical representation of the plant’s condition. Users are given these real-time haptic cues through FlowIO, a pneumatic platform for controlling the airflow and pressure of soft devices. We predict that the increase in awareness of natural entities through interactive embodied experiences will promote the Inclusion of Nature in Self (INS), and encourage pro-environmental behaviors.},

abstract = {The data used to train deep neural network (DNN) models in applications such as healthcare and finance typically contain sensitive information. A DNN model may suffer from overfitting– it will perform very well on samples seen during training, and poorly on samples not seen during training. Overfitted models have been shown to be susceptible to query-based attacks such as membership inference attacks (MIAs). MIAs aim to determine whether a sample belongs to the dataset used to train a classifier (members) or not (nonmembers). Recently, a new class of label-based MIAs (LAB MIAs) was proposed, where an adversary was only required to have knowledge of predicted labels of samples. LAB MIAs used the insight that member samples were typically located farther away from a classification decision boundary than nonmembers, and were shown to be highly effective across multiple datasets. Developing a defense against an adversary carrying out a LAB MIA on DNN models that cannot be retrained remains an open problem. We present LDL, a light weight defense against LAB MIAs. LDL works by constructing a high-dimensional sphere around queried samples such that the model decision is unchanged for (noisy) variants of the sample within the sphere. This sphere of label-invariance creates ambiguity and prevents a querying adversary from correctly determining whether a sample is a member or a nonmember. We analytically characterize the success rate of an adversary carrying out a LAB MIA when LDL is deployed, and show that the formulation is consistent with experimental observations. We evaluate LDL on seven datasets– CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, GTSRB, Face, Purchase, Location, and Texas– with varying sizes of training data. All of these datasets have been used by SOTA LAB MIAs. Our experiments demonstrate that LDL reduces the success rate of an adversary carrying out a LAB MIA in each case. We empirically compare LDL with defenses against LAB MIAs that require retraining of DNN models, and show that LDL performs favorably despite not needing to retrain the DNNs.},

abstract = {Several applications require counting the number of distinct items in the data, which is known as the cardinality counting problem. Example applications include health applications such as rare disease patients counting for adequate awareness and funding, and counting the number of cases of a new disease for outbreak detection, marketing applications such as counting the visibility reached for a new product, and cybersecurity applications such as tracking the number of unique views of social media posts. The data needed for the counting is however often personal and sensitive, and need to be processed using privacy-preserving techniques. The quality of data in different databases, for example typos, errors and variations, poses additional challenges for accurate cardinality estimation. While privacy-preserving cardinality counting has gained much attention in the recent times and a few privacy-preserving algorithms have been developed for cardinality estimation, no work has so far been done on privacy-preserving cardinality counting using record linkage techniques with fuzzy matching and provable privacy guarantees. We propose a novel privacy-preserving record linkage algorithm using unsupervised clustering techniques to link and count the cardinality of individuals in multiple datasets without compromising their privacy or identity. In addition, existing Elbow methods to find the optimal number of clusters as the cardinality are far from accurate as they do not take into account the purity and completeness of generated clusters. We propose a novel method to find the optimal number of clusters in unsupervised learning. Our experimental results on real and synthetic datasets are highly promising in terms of significantly smaller error rate of less than 0.1 with a privacy budget ϵ = 1.0 compared to the state-of-the-art fuzzy matching and clustering method.},

abstract = {When seeking to maximise the authenticity of assessment in programming courses it makes sense to provide students with practical programming problems to solve in an environment that is close to real software development practice, i.e., online, open book, and using their typical development environment. This creates an assessment environment that should afford students sufficient opportunities to evidence what they have learned, but also creates practical challenges in terms of academic integrity, flexibility in the automated grading process, and assumptions surrounding how the student may attempt to solve the problems both in terms of correct and incorrect solutions. In this experience report, we outline two independently observed cohorts of students sitting the same Java programming exam, with different weights, over three years. This is undertaken as a reflective exercise in order to derive a series of recommendations and retrospectively obvious pitfalls to act as guidance for educators considering online programming exams for large (i.e. n &gt; 150) introductory programming courses. After discussing our assessment methodology, we provide 4 high-level observations and centre a set of recommendations around these to aid practitioners in their assessment design.},

abstract = {Knowledge of programming and computing is becoming increasingly valuable in today's world, and thus it is crucial that students from all backgrounds have the opportunity to learn. As the teaching of computing at high-school becomes more common, there is a growing need for approaches and tools that are effective and engaging for all students. Especially for students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented at university level, positive experiences at high-school can be an important factor for their future academic choices. In this paper we report on a hands-on programming workshop that we ran over multiple sessions for Maori and Pasifika high-school students who are underrepresented in computer science at the tertiary level in New Zealand. In the workshop, participants developed Scratch programs starting from a simple template we provided. In order to control the action in their programs, half of the participants used standard mouse and keyboard inputs, and the other half had access to plug-and-play sensors that provided real-time environmental data. We explore how students' perceptions of self-efficacy and outcome expectancy -- both key constructs driving academic career choices -- changed during the workshop and how these were impacted by the availability of the sensor toolkit. We found that participants enjoyed the workshop and reported improved self-efficacy with or without use of the toolkit, but outcome expectancy improved only for students who used the sensor toolkit.},

abstract = {Full-duplex devices can compromise the integrity of wireless channel measurements through signal relaying and several attacks have been proposed based on this vulnerability. Existing source authentication methods relying on previously-collected signatures face significant challenges in detecting these attacks because a relay attacker can gradually inject the channels so that the manipulated channels will fall within the tolerance range of the authentication methods and are mistaken as new signatures. In this paper, we propose RelayShield, a system for detecting malicious relays and recovering the legitimate transmitter-receiver channels from the manipulated channels. RelayShield requires only one channel measurement at the receiver. It analyzes signal path information resolved from input channels to detect relays and recover channels. RelayShield achieves over 95\% detection accuracy with channels collected in two typical indoor environments. The recovered channels can support a wide range of applications, including secret generation protocols and sensing systems.},

Moreover, enhancements to reduce the necessary setup time via the introduction of battery presets and the possibility of configuring cell packs are proposed. The proposed model extension was validated via appropriate evaluations, and the results were nearly identical to the battery-discharge curves provided in manufacturer datasheets. The proposed enhancements may enable the identification of the operation limits of communication devices in various environments and thus aid improvements in the energy performance of communication protocols, applications, sensors, and electric vehicles.},

abstract = {Vehicle based logistics are hinged on their ability to timely deliver goods, services, and people. The classical expression of “time is money” comes alive in the logistics industry yielding potentially huge financial and health consequences in case of missing deadlines. This is especially the case for time sensitive pharmaceuticals, delivery of perishable goods, delivery of people travelling, delivery of services in fault fixing/recovery sector. All these use cases motivate the need for an immutable, secure, and immortalized process of tracking time. To solve this challenge, this paper presents prototype-based research that integrates the 4th industrial revolution technologies of vision Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and blockchain. The developed prototype features a Raspberry-PI board embedding a camera, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to recognize plate letters from the image and a crypto wallet to sign the logging of plate number and time events on the NEAR blockchain, an emerging sharded, proof-of-stake, layer-one blockchain that is simple to use, secure and scalable. The effective operation of the developed prototype has been validated inside a campus parking and shows an accuracy of 80\%. The benefits of transparency, security, and immutability of the blockchain combined with the intelligence, data capture, and processing of IoT will enable to develop accountability solutions trusted by all different logistic stakeholders.},

Nevertheless, it became possible to measure it in daily life in an unobtrusive manner with wearable devices. Rather than camera recordings and extraction of the state from the images, wrist-worn devices can measure directly via accelerometer, heart rate, and heart rate variability sensors. Some measured features can be as follows: time to bed, time out of bed, bedtime duration, minutes to fall asleep, and minutes after wake-up. There are several studies in the literature regarding sleep quality and stage prediction. However, they use only wearable data to predict or focus on the sleep stage. In this study, we use the NetHealth dataset, which is collected from 698 college students’ via wearables, as well as surveys. Recently, there has been an advancement in deep learning algorithms, and they generally perform better than conventional machine learning techniques. Among them, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have high performances. Thus, in this study, we apply different CNN architectures that have already performed well in the human activity recognition domain and compare their results. We also apply Random Forest (RF) since it performs best among the conventional methods. In future studies, we will compare them with other deep learning algorithms.},

abstract = {An immense volume of data is produced by sensor devices in the fields of aquaponics, hydroponics, and soil-based food production, where these devices track various environmental factors. Data stream mining is the method of retrieving data from fast-sampled data sources that are constantly streaming. The accuracy of data obtained through data stream mining is largely determined by the algorithm utilized to filter out noise. For threshold-based automation, an actuator can be activated when the value of sensor data is above a permissible threshold. Noise from sensors may activate the actuator. Several statistical and machine learning-based noise-suppression algorithms have been proposed in the literature. They have been evaluated based on the mean squared error metric (MSE). The Long Short-Term Memory – LSTM filter (MSE: 0.000999943) performs better noise suppression than other traditional filters – Kalman (MSE: 0.0015982). We propose a new noise suppression filter – LSTM combined with Kalman (LSTM-KF). In LSTM-KF, the Kalman filter acts as an encoder and the LSTM becomes the decoder, resulting in a significantly lower MSE – 0.000080789592. The LSTM-KF is installed in our threshold-based aquaponics automation to maximize sustainable food production at minimum cost.},

abstract = {This article presents an approach to provide strong assurance of the secure execution of distributed event-driven applications on shared infrastructures, while relying on a small Trusted Computing Base. We build upon and extend security primitives provided by Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to guarantee authenticity and integrity properties of applications, and to secure control of input and output devices. More specifically, we guarantee that if an output is produced by the application, it was allowed to be produced by the application’s source code based on an authentic trace of inputs.We present an integrated open-source framework to develop, deploy, and use such applications across heterogeneous TEEs. Beyond authenticity and integrity, our framework optionally provides confidentiality and a notion of availability, and facilitates software development at a high level of abstraction over the platform-specific TEE layer. We support event-driven programming to develop distributed enclave applications in Rust and C for heterogeneous TEE, including Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone, and Sancus.In this article we discuss the workings of our approach, the extensions we made to the Sancus processor, and the integration of our development model with commercial TEEs. Our evaluation of security and performance aspects show that TEEs, together with our programming model, form a basis for powerful security architectures for dependable systems in domains such as Industrial Control Systems and the Internet of Things, illustrating our framework’s unique suitability for a broad range of use cases which combine cloud processing, mobile and edge devices, and lightweight sensing and actuation.},

Smart healthcare systems use the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices to capture patients’ health data for treatment or diagnostic purposes. This sensitive collected patient data is shared between the different stakeholders across the network to provide quality services. Due to this, healthcare systems are vulnerable to confidentiality, integrity and privacy threats. In the COVID-19 scenario, when collaborative medical consultation is required, the quality assessment of the framework is essential to protect the privacy of doctors and patients. In this paper, a ring signature-based anonymous authentication and quality assessment scheme is designed for collaborative medical consultation environments for quality assessment and protection of the privacy of doctors and patients. This scheme also uses a new KMOV Cryptosystem to ensure the quality of the network and protect the system from different attacks that hamper data confidentiality.},

abstract = {The growing integration of technology into our lives has resulted in unprecedented amounts of data that are being exchanged among devices in an Internet of Things (IoT) environment. Authentication, identification, and device heterogeneities are major security and privacy concerns in IoT. One of the most effective solutions to avoid unauthorized access to sensitive information is biometrics. Deep learning-based biometric systems have been proven to outperform traditional image processing and machine learning techniques. However, the image quality covariates associated with blur, resolution, illumination, and noise predominantly affect recognition performance. Therefore, assessing the robustness of the developed solution is another important concern that still needs to be investigated. This article proposes a periocular region-based biometric system and explores the effect of image quality covariates (artifacts) on the performance of periocular recognition. To simulate the real-time scenarios and understand the consequences of blur, resolution, and bit-depth of images on the recognition accuracy of periocular biometrics, we modeled out-of-focus blur, camera shake blur, low-resolution, and low bit-depth image acquisition using Gaussian function, linear motion, interpolation, and bit plan slicing, respectively. All the images of the UBIRIS.v1 database are degraded by varying strength of image quality covariates to obtain degraded versions of the database. Afterward, deep models are trained with each degraded version of the database. The performance of the model is evaluated by measuring statistical parameters calculated from a confusion matrix. Experimental results show that among all types of covariates, camera shake blur has less effect on the recognition performance, while out-of-focus blur significantly impacts it. Irrespective of image quality, the convolutional neural network produces excellent results, which proves the robustness of the developed model.},

abstract = {With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT), there has been a rapid increase in the use of sensors to intelligently monitor the environment and movement of objects. Smart solutions have been widely used for monitoring infectious diseases by limiting the transmission of contagious diseases using proximity sensing systems. This is an alternative to conventional social distancing technologies like Bluetooth and cameras which uses machine learning (ML), image processing to identify trespassers, and multiple object detection in real-time. This paper leverages the emerging Tiny ML technology to design and develop a wearable device that can prevent infectious diseases from spreading. The device senses the cough sound of the nearest person within a limited distance and then identify the nearest objects such as humans, animals (dog, goats), and wind-blown vegetation, based on patterns of PIR signals bounced back from different objects.&nbsp; By using machine learning algorithms, the device can be able to notify the user when they are in a safe environment or not. This solution is a wearable device that has the potential to be used in monitoring the transmission of contagious diseases by detecting and identifying moving objects and alerting people to keep their distance when they are in an unsafe environment with a&nbsp;high risk of being exposed to the disease. This work-focused research project will particularly focus on monitoring the risk environment to prevent infectious diseases between humans and between humans and animals, reminding users to keep their distance for their safety and the use of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm on the device for identifying moving objects and for detecting cough. The system has been evaluated, and the experiments have shown a performance accuracy of 92.1\% for object detection and 68\% for cough detection, promising for detecting a safe environment.&nbsp; This accuracy could be increased over time via reinforcement learning.},

abstract = {Climate change is one of the most significant challenges to every country's development, ravaging havoc on the lives of all people on this planet. Researchers have raised numerous research and studies of strategies for tracking climate change. The current climate change tracking method in Rwanda employs a weather station model, in which numerous fixed weather stations are installed throughout the country; however, due to its immobility, this process cannot cover the entire country. With the lack of advanced methodologies and technology, the process of climate change tracking has become extremely expensive and suffered inaccuracies due to a lack of proper knowledge of analyzing collected data, and the lack of specific accurate hardware. Throughout this research, with the use of the MQ-135 and DHT11 sensors, ESP8266 collects carbon dioxide gas and temperature/humidity respectively and other component include a push button for detecting the current season. ESP8266 is programmed to send data over MQTT protocol, which uses Wi-Fi capability to send data to MQTT Broker. Using the MQTT protocol's Publish/Subscribe criteria, node-red subscribes to the topics defined in the MQTT broker to obtain data, which is then sent to MongoDB for permanent storage and also fed into the machine learning model for climate change/warming prediction. Different algorithms are used to evaluate this model. As result, Random Forest classifier approves itself to be the best model in evaluating the built model. This study shows that the increase in carbon dioxide gas leads to the gradual increase in the environmental temperature. Finally, the prediction clarifies that if no measures are taken presently, the climate change in Rwanda's Industrial zone will be dominated by warming periods in the future.},

This promotes a variety of ambient assistive living applications, such as fitness tracking, fall detection, home automation system, healthcare monitoring etc. In this paper, a human activity recognition based on the amalgamation of statistical global features and local deep features is presented. The proposed model adopts temporal convolutional architecture to extract the long-range temporal patterns from the inertial activity signals captured by smartphones. To further enrich the information, statistical features are computed so that the global features of the time series data are encoded. Next, both global and local deep features are combined for classification. The proposed model is evaluated by using WISDM and UCI HAR datasets for user-dependent and independent protocols, respectively, to ensure its feasibility as user-dependent and independent HAR solutions. The obtained empirical results exhibit that the proposed model is outperforming the other existing deep learning models on both user-dependent and independent testing protocols.},

Even informing someone about their health issues is a challenge for them. In developing countries new technologies, including the internet of things, are being used to monitor old adults’ health and activities, thus enabling them to live safely and independently at home as they age. This study aimed at designing and prototyping a system intended to help improve the health of elderly people in Sub-Saharan Africa. This can be achieved by providing a relatively easy way to monitor the health of elderly people remotely and provide vital signs information of elderly people periodically with automatic alerts in case of emergency issues and tracking the location of elderly people. Therefore, architecture for context awareness and IoT- based systems is proposed to improve the health monitoring of elderly people in Africa and thus improve the quality of life of elderly people. The system uses a heartbeat sensor, Temperature sensor, and GPS Module to collect data with Arduino Uno as Microcontroller. The collected data is sent to the cloud using GSM Module. The cloud data is stored, processed, analyzed, and then sends to the caregiver and Doctor. This system will enhance the quality of life for elderly people by enabling them to get real-time health information and medication from any location. Additionally, it will enable healthcare practitioners to remotely monitor them.},

Different interaction technologies, techniques, and methods can support it, including RFID, a well-known technology capable of identifying and locating actors. However, the variety of application domains and interaction possibilities jeopardize the use of RFID without a clear understanding of its usage issues. Therefore, we have performed a systematic mapping to characterize the adoption of RFID technology in this kind of interactive software system by intercepting human-computer interaction and software engineering issues. Our goal is to reveal (i) which application domains address RFID; (ii) why RFID is used instead of other technologies; (iii) who interacts through RFID and how the interaction is; (iv) what are the requirements and limitations associated with it; and (v) what are the common quality characteristics and measures which should be considered for their evaluation. The results showed that (i) RFID is specially used for implementing implicit interactions in healthcare, embedded systems, and manufacturing applications. (ii) Passive UHF RFID is usually adopted due to being contactless, low-cost, and well-performing indoors. (iii) It interacts with humans and things in the same proportion, most frequently to collect locations of sensor data constantly. (iv) RFID presents limitations, such as causing electromagnetic interference and not working well near metallic walls. However, tags work under high temperatures and can be well hidden in cement or clothes. (v) Interactive system designers usually create applications with invisible infrastructures, which tend to keep users' focus on the real world.?},

abstract = {Museums play an increasingly important role in public health. In-house makerspaces, fab labs and other contexts fostering 21st century skills could expand children's participation in these initiatives. This could open up new opportunities for children to learn through technology design and enable museums to enhance cultural relevance of health education materials for children. Here we report on a participatory action research study exploring child-to-child public health messaging through a portable craft tech interactive in a rural community museum. The interactive was a floor-based learning game using milk-carton foot switches connected to wireless sensor network hardware programmed with Scratch. The study was run during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, when non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) such as face masks and physical distancing were the principal means for slowing the spread of the virus. Five primary school children worked in a multigenerational team to design an interactive reinforcing COVID-19 NPI messaging. The interactive was presented in four primary schools and a day care centre, where it was used by 747 learners. A mixed methods approach was used to collect data on children's participation in the design process and peer responses to the interactive in the presentations. Results suggest that portable craft tech interactives are a promising new medium for engaging children in public health messaging for children. Designers can make significant contributions to source, message and channel variables, which enhance the fit of education materials with target group culture and provide context and meaning for health messages. 92,9\% of the 707 users who completed a post-use survey indicated they would use an interactive again if they had the chance; 88,8\% indicated they would like to design an interactive with friends; and 59,4\% chose a craft tech interactive game to teach a friend about the coronavirus – over a school textbook, colourful poster, TV advertisement, and radio programme.},

abstract = {Particulate Matter (PM) is a major air pollutant that has the potential for adversely affecting human health. Actionable data on the spatial distribution of temporal variability of PM2.5 emission hot spots in large cities are sparse. The main objective of this research is to provide a protocol for using search agents to hunt for PM2.5 emission hot spots in urban environments. We propose short range identification of variability of harmful PM2.5 concentrations can be achieved using IoT devices mounted on a mobile platform. We propose that long range identification the PM2.5 emission hot spots can attained by searching through the city on different days. We applied this approach to Hyderabad, India by fixing a mobile platform on a street car. We corrected the IoT device measurement errors by calibrating the sensing component data against a reference instrument co-located on the mobile platform. We identified that random forest regression was the most suitable technique to reduce the variability between the IoT devices. The spatial variability of PM2.5 harmful emission hot spots at industrial settings and congested roads were identified. The temporal variability based on image processing shows a weak correlation between PM2.5 concentrations and number of vehicles, and PM2.5 and visibility. The Hyderabad PM2.5 emission hot spots findings demonstrate a clear need to inform people with heart and lung conditions when it is unhealthy to be outside; and when it is unhealthy for children and elderly people to be outside for prolonged periods. Our emission hunting approach can be applied to any mobile platform carried by people walking, cycling or by drones and robots in any city.},

Although drone monitoring has been an active research topic, most of the existing monitoring systems focus only on line-of-sight conditions and do not perform well under blockage conditions. Inspired by the human ability to localize objects in the environment using both visual and auditory signals, we develop a mobile system that integrates the information from multiple modalities into a reference scenario and performs real-time drone detection and trajectory monitoring. Our developed system, controlled by the Raspberry Pi platform, collects acoustic signals from 6 hexagonal channels placed 5 cm away from each other and video signals from an HD RGB camera. The monitoring system is placed in a moving vehicle and is able to track the drone even when it is flying/hovering behind the bush or trees. Furthermore, the portability of the system enables continuous chasing of the drone, allowing for uninterrupted monitoring and tracking even while on the move. In addition, the proposed system performs reliably in both day and night conditions.},

abstract = {A generalized indoor light sensor can provide information to build and monitor indoor lighting arrangement that is aesthetically pleasing and conforming to the requirements set forth by the inhabitants. However, the identification of the surrounding lighting environment from the sensed parameters has some limitations and challenges. Till-to-date, classifiers are designed to identify only a single source, even in a multi-source environment. Classification based only on sensed values can be imperfect, as multi-type sources can share common parameters, or readings from a single source can fluctuate over time. The classification performances are mostly evaluated in controlled environments. In this work, we use a customised Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based light sensor that can sense and advertise major lighting parameters as instructed. Based on sensed parameters and adopting several Machine Learning (ML) and Neural Network (NN) based models off-board, we try to identify the singular and mixed presence of the four dissimilar types of sources: Incandescent, LED, CFL, and Sunlight in indoor surroundings. Off-board identification can get challenging where packet loss scenario is common. For that, we study how IoT devices with superior computational capability can utilise dimensional reduction techniques to minimize the required on-air traffic for classification. We then test classifiers with all those approaches both in controlled environments and real-world testbeds. The result shows that our best model can detect lighting environments with an accuracy of up to 98.22\% in the controlled scenario and 83.33\% in real-world testbeds.},

abstract = {Rapid advances in programmable network devices catalyzed the development of in-network computing, which is foreseen as a key enabler to empower the intelligence of production lines and mechanical arms in Industry 4.0. Various pioneering approaches have demonstrated the significant benefits of moving simple yet delay-sensitive industrial control tasks performed by servers to network switches. However, our detailed field study at a top-tier auto glass factory reveals that current practice fails to achieve a real-time and deterministic intelligent decision closure as leaving those complex yet essential planning tasks still on edge or cloud. In this paper, we design and implement a brand-new industrial switch, named Netopia, on a commercial Zynq platform through software and hardware co-design. Netopia enables planning and control to simultaneously perform on a network switch during communication. At the core of Netopia are three simple yet effective modules - a determinism guarantee mechanism, a computing acceleration scheme, and a packet deterministic forwarding framework that work hand-in-hand to ensure mechanical arms obtain intelligent control commands with low and deterministic latency. Comprehensive evaluations in industrial environments demonstrate that Netopia achieves an average end-to-end intelligent decision latency of 3.0ms with a jitter &lt; 0.4ms, reduced by &gt; 86\% over existing works.},

abstract = {We present the first wireless earbud hardware that can perform hearing screening by detecting otoacoustic emissions. The conventional wisdom has been that detecting otoacoustic emissions, which are the faint sounds generated by the cochlea, requires sensitive and expensive acoustic hardware. Thus, medical devices for hearing screening cost thousands of dollars and are inaccessible in low and middle income countries. We show that by designing wireless ear-buds using low-cost acoustic hardware and combining them with wireless sensing algorithms, we can reliably identify otoacoustic emissions and perform hearing screening. Our algorithms combine frequency modulated chirps with wideband pulses emitted from a low-cost speaker to reliably separate otoacoustic emissions from in-ear reflections and echoes. We conducted a clinical study with 50 ears across two healthcare sites. Our study shows that the low-cost earbuds detect hearing loss with 100\% sensitivity and 89.7\% specificity, which is comparable to the performance of a $8000 medical device. By developing low-cost and open-source wearable technology, our work may help address global health inequities in hearing screening by democratizing these medical devices.Open-source hardware and code can be found here: https://github.com/uw-x/OAEbuds},

abstract = {Evaluating hardware for deep learning is challenging. The models can take days or more to run, the datasets are generally larger than what fits into memory, and the models are sensitive to interference. Scaling this up to a large amount of experiments and keeping track of both software and hardware metrics thus poses real difficulties as these problems are exacerbated by sheer experimental data volume. This paper explores some of the data management and exploration difficulties when working on machine learning systems research. We introduce our solution in the form of an open-source framework built on top of a machine learning lifecycle platform. Additionally, we introduce a web environment for visualizing and exploring experimental data.},

abstract = {Smoking is a significant cause of death and deterioration of health worldwide, affecting active and passive smokers. Cessation of smoking contributes to an essential health and wellness application owing to the broad range of health problems such as cancer, hypertension, and several cardiopulmonary diseases. Personalized smoking-cessation applications can be very effective in helping users to stop smoking if there are detections and interventions done at the right time. This requires real-time detection of smoking puffs. Such applications are made feasible by day-long monitoring and smoking puff detection from unobtrusive devices such as wearables. This paper proposes a deep inference technique for the real-time detection of smoking puffs on a wearable device. We show that a simple, sequential Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using only 6-axis Inertial signals can be utilized in place of complex and resource-consuming Deep Learning models. The accuracy achieved is comparable to State-of-the-Art techniques with an F1 score of 0.81, although the model size is tiny - 114 kB. Such small models can be deployed on the lowest configuration hardware platforms, achieving accurate but high-speed, low-power inference on conventional smartwatches. We ensure that the auto-designed models are directly compatible with resource-constrained platforms such as TensorFlow Lite and TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (TFLM) without requiring further use of model reduction and optimization techniques. Our proposed approach will allow affordable wearable device manufacturers to run smoking detection on their devices, as it is tiny enough to fit TinyML platforms and is only dependent on IMU sensors that are universally available.},
