abstract = {Large pre-trained models have significantly advanced computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). However, their deployment is challenging in privacy-sensitive scenarios where data must remain decentralized. Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue by enabling local model training without sharing raw data. Despite this advantage, integrating large models into FL introduces challenges such as training inefficiencies, label scarcity, and data heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose FedDiAL, a framework designed to effectively incorporate large pre-trained models into FL while addressing these challenges. At its core, FedDiAL, features the novel HDis-Net, which enhances the efficiency of large models in resource-constrained environments. We introduce a two-phase training strategy with probabilistic feature augmentation to improve feature discrimination. Additionally, we propose an adaptive pseudo-labeling method to generate high-confidence labels, mitigating label scarcity. To handle data heterogeneity, we develop a focused fine-tuning strategy that adapts HDis-Net to diverse client data distributions. Our theoretical analysis establishes the convergence of HDis-Net. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including Tiny ImageNet and AG News, demonstrate that FedDiAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 35.66\% accuracy improvement in both CV and NLP tasks.},

abstract = {Recently, we have been inundated with dynamic, time-evolving activity data streams generated by various individual IoT/sensor devices (e.g., healthcare devices and factory equipment). What would be the ideal mechanism for adaptively summarizing and modeling individual and local activities directly on small IoT devices with limited computing resources? In this paper, we present MicroAdapt, which comprises scalable and effective algorithms for modeling and forecasting time-evolving data streams. Our proposed method has the following advantages: (a) Adaptivity: it continuously monitors the latest time-series patterns in data streams, recognizes any sudden changes, updates model parameters, and enables real-time, long-range forecasting; (b) Any-time processing: it operates on a large collection of data streams, requiring a constant time (i.e., O(1)) for model updates and future predictions, at any point in time; (c) Lightweight computing: it does not require high-performance computing machines equipped with powerful GPUs, such as those used in deep learning, and can run on lightweight computers or even ''edge'' computing devices, such as Raspberry Pi. Intuitively, our method is inspired by the concept of an evolutionary adaptation mechanism of microorganisms, and thus it enables adaptive, any-time, lightweight model estimation and summarization of non-stationary data streams whose time-series patterns are constantly changing over time. We conduct extensive experiments on real datasets and demonstrate that MicroAdapt effectively captures important time-series patterns in the data streams, makes long-range forecasts, and consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods (e.g., TSMixer) as regards accuracy and execution speed. MicroAdapt improves accuracy by about 60\% for MSE and 30\% for MAE, while reducing computation time by up to six orders of magnitude (more than 100,000 times). We also applied our analytics to experiments implemented on Raspberry Pi with real IoT data streams, thus demonstrating the practicality and effectiveness of our approach. In fact, our proposed method required less than 1.95GB of memory and consumed less than 1.69W of power.},

abstract = {Evaluation plays a crucial role in the development of ranking algorithms on search and recommender systems. It enables online platforms to create user-friendly features that drive commercial success in a steady and effective manner. The online environment is particularly conducive to applying causal inference techniques, such as randomized controlled experiments (known as A/B test), which are often more challenging to implement in fields like medicine and public policy. However, businesses face unique challenges when it comes to effective A/B test. Specifically, achieving sufficient statistical power for conversion-based metrics can be time-consuming, especially for significant purchases like booking accommodations. While offline evaluations are quicker and more cost-effective, they often lack accuracy and are inadequate for selecting candidates for A/B test. To address these challenges, we developed interleaving and counterfactual evaluation methods to facilitate rapid online assessments for identifying the most promising candidates for A/B tests. Our approach not only increased the sensitivity of experiments by a factor of up to 100 (depending on the approach and metrics) compared to traditional A/B testing but also streamlined the experimental process. The practical insights gained from usage in production can also benefit organizations with similar interests.},

abstract = {Serious Games (SGs) have the potential to provide clinical care and enhance patients’ quality of life, while incorporating an element of entertainment. As part of the iPROLEPSIS Horizon Europe project, we introduce two Sensorimotor Art games designed as SGs to assist Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) patients in managing their symptoms. These SGs provide a platform for self-expression and pain relief through engaging in rhythmic puzzle activities. The co-design process for the proposed Sensorimotor Art games followed an agile methodology, involving 14 experts (including clinicians, researchers, and game developers), to gather feedback on game requirements, storyboards, and mechanics. From the thematic analysis of the transcribed discussion, four main themes emerged, namely: Clinical value (Theme 1), Motor skills and adaptation (Theme 2), Creative engagement (Theme 3), and Feedback and future directions (Theme 4). Clinical value underlines the therapeutic benefits of Sensorimotor Art games for pain distraction and emotional well-being. Motor skills and adaptation focus on hand/finger use and adapting games for older patients. Creative engagement emphasizes fostering creativity, a positive environment, and goal achievement. Finally, Feedback and future directions highlight the importance of continuous feedback and occupational therapists’ involvement in coming sessions. The development of Sensorimotor Art games lays the groundwork for digital interventions to alleviate psychological distress and improve fine motor symptoms in PsA patients. At the same time, these SGs can also provide insights to healthcare providers and policymakers for developing future digital solutions tailored to PsA patients.},

This technology addresses the challenges of traditional testing and learning, which often involve high costs, hardware limitations, and health concerns. In this paper, we use Blender, an open-source 3D creation software, to model a virtual vineyard and a wine sensory analysis laboratory. The vineyard is populated with various plants across a large virtual space, and the sensory lab is designed to simulate wine-tasting processes. The virtual lab enables users to explore and understand the sensory characteristics of wine in a controlled, immersive environment, providing an effective alternative to physical labs. Our simulations demonstrate that VR can replicate real-world environments with high fidelity and improve user engagement. The results suggest that using VR for wine sensory analysis can enhance educational outcomes, reduce costs, and offer an innovative platform for research and learning.},

abstract = {In this sample-structured document, neither the cross-linking The rapid growth of digitization has led to a skyrocketing increase in Data Center (DC) energy consumption. By 2030, all DCs worldwide are expected to consume 13\% of global energy demand, potentially up to 21\%. This could lead to significant operational costs, power security impacts in the energy ecosystem, and environmental threats. Hence, optimizing a DC, particularly the class of High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters, is a significant concern. Integrating the IoT, sensors, and intelligent devices has significantly contributed to generating vast operational management data from various aspects of the DC industry. Indeed, effectively modeling and processing this data could improve energy efficiency, ensure reliability, reduce operating costs, and sustainably manage DC. However, prior heuristics, statistical, and engineering methods could not be effective for modeling and simulating this data. In this work, the authors provide a holistic approach based on Blockchain Digital Twin (DT), augmented by Artificial Intelligence (AI) processed data to represent the DC physical complex system in virtual and tokenized models. The objective is to obtain near-real-time prediction, optimization, monitoring, controlling and improved decision-making. In detail, the methodology, the architecture and steps taken to develop a scalable analytical or "Analytical Dashboard" in Blockchain are shown. The pioneering Blockchain DC Digital Twin framework and approach, experimented in a real infrastructural setting (ENEA HPC "CRESCO 6") learns from actual operational data and allows the management, monitoring, and control in real-time visualization of whole DC, thus allowing a coverage of the DC status and the optimization of its functionalities. Our aim is also to show the achieved benefits of the Blockchain Digital Twin DC challenge for various stakeholders.},

Based on multi-source data fusion technology, this thesis discusses the key technologies and application issues for achieving efficient human-machine collaboration in the smart manufacturing environment.The paper first introduces the basic concepts and development trends of human-machine collaborative systems, and analyses the current challenges in the field of smart manufacturing, such as data silos, delayed information transfer and insufficient collaborative efficiency. It then delves into the role of multi-source data fusion technology in these challenges, emphasising that by fusing data from different sensors, devices and systems, the decision-making capability and responsiveness of the system can be improved, thus optimising the production process.The paper further proposes a collaborative framework based on multi-source data fusion, covering key steps such as data acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction, fusion algorithm and intelligent decision-making. On this basis, the paper experimentally verifies the application effect of the framework in the actual production environment, showing that it has significant advantages in improving production efficiency, reducing energy consumption, and improving product quality.This research not only provides a new solution for human-machine collaboration in intelligent manufacturing, but also provides a theoretical foundation and technical support for academic research and industrial practice in related fields.},

abstract = {This study addresses the overtourism problem by developing a Sustainable Development Planning (STD) model to optimise the sustainability of tourism. The model balances economic benefits with environmental and social sustainability through a multi-objective optimisation strategy. Pearson correlation analyses are used to identify the key factors affecting total sustainable tourism revenue, environmental pressure and infrastructure pressure. Regression models are constructed for each factor, including constraints on tourist numbers, environmental capacity and infrastructure limitations. Genetic algorithms are utilized to determine the optimal number of tourists and target values to provide theoretical support for tourism regulation and tax allocation. The stability of the model is determined through prediction error analysis and sensitivity analysis. To assess its applicability, the model is tested in two diffuse flow areas, Juneau and Barcelona. The results demonstrate that the model is effective in determining the optimal number of tourists, tourism revenue, amount of tax revenue and target values. This highlights the potential of the model as a tool to guide sustainable tourism development. The study provides a practical framework for sustainable planning and a template for other regions dealing with similar issues.},

abstract = {Ear-EEG sensing is on the horizon for ear-worn devices, such as hearing instruments, and it is anticipated to revolutionize cognitive state monitoring outside the clinical setting, owing to its unobtrusive nature. Like scalp-EEG, ear-EEG is prone to non-neural physiological artifacts, such as ocular, muscular, and cardiac. Although artifacts are typically treated as non-desirable signals intended for rejection, they could serve as a source of information about the individual, thus advancing ear-EEG to ear-ExG. As there is still a scarcity of literature within this area, using the cEEGrid around-the-ear electrode array, we systematically recorded the jaw artifact in a series of experimental scenarios engaging the muscles involved in mastication and speech production. Within the scope of preliminary data analysis, we evaluated the statistical significance of a state-of-art-based feature set in terms of chewing-speaking classification by means of a Wilcoxon rank sum test. The resulting p-values indicated that the features with p &lt; 0.05 are typically those expressing the chewing rate and the increase in amplitude, as well as a shift towards higher frequencies, that takes place within the characteristic chewing “bursts.” By fully utilizing the research potential of the obtained dataset and with the prospect of ear-ExG integration into hearing devices, this work aspires to promote healthy ageing and enhance accessibility in technology through novel human-computer interfaces.},

In this paper, we introduce VirCHEW Reality, a face-worn haptic device designed to provide on-face kinesthetic force feedback, to enhance the virtual food-chewing experience in VR. Leveraging a pneumatic actuation system, VirCHEW Reality controlled the process of air inflation and deflation, to simulate the mechanical properties of food textures, such as hardness, cohesiveness, and stickiness. We evaluated the system through three user studies. First, a just-noticeable difference (JND) study examined users’ sensitivity to and the system’s capability of rendering different levels of on-face pneumatic-based kinesthetic feedback while users performing chewing action. Building upon the user-distinguishable signal ranges found in the first study, we further conducted a matching study to explore the correspondence between the kinesthetic stimuli provided by our device and user-perceived food textures, revealing the capability of simulating food texture properties during chewing (e.g., hardness, cohesiveness, stickiness). Finally, a user study in a VR eating scenario showed that VirCHEW Reality could significantly improve the users’ ratings on the sense of presence, compared to the condition without haptic feedback. Our findings further highlighted possible applications in virtual/remote dining, healthcare, and immersive entertainment.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, several research groups have introduced innovative hardware designs for Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), aiming to secure applications against potentially compromised privileged software, including the kernel [10, 63]. Since 2015 [94], a new class of software-enabled hardware attacks leveraging energy management mechanisms has emerged. These internal energy-based attacks comprise fault [86], side-channel [46], and covert channel attacks [28]. Their aim is to bypass TEE security guarantees and expose sensitive information such as cryptographic keys. They have increased in prevalence in the past few years [9, 24, 40]. Popular TEE implementations, such as ARM TrustZone and Intel SGX, incorporate countermeasures against these attacks. However, these countermeasures either hinder the capabilities of the power management mechanisms or have been shown to provide insufficient system protection [9, 55]. This article presents the first comprehensive knowledge survey of these attacks, along with an evaluation of literature countermeasures. We believe that this study will spur further community efforts toward this increasingly important type of attacks.},

abstract = {Passive Infra-Red (PIR) sensors are ubiquitous and have applications ranging from automatic lighting and heating control in smart buildings, towel dispensers in washrooms, security alarms (for intrusion detection) to human detection robots (for search and rescue). Unfortunately, PIR sensors are prone to failures during deployment due to reasons such as environmental damage, incorrect installation and component degradation among others that can lead to incorrect or faulty data. Currently, such failures are typically detected using either : (a) heavily engineered data-driven, statistical approaches that can have high false positive rates due to unseen data patterns or (b) expensive, unscalable methods that use additional hardware such as video cameras or a golden reference sensor. In this work, we first create a taxonomy for the most common PIR sensor failures and analyze these failures from the perspective of sensor physics. We then present PIRMedic— a physics-driven, edge-based approach to detect and diagnose the failures in a PIR sensor using an intrinsic hardware signal&nbsp;viz., the analog output from the pyroelectric element in the sensor. Using this hardware signal in conjunction with frequency analysis and supervised machine learning methods, we obtain a high accuracy of 98-99\% in failure detection and diagnosis. We evaluate our methods using multiple real-world deployments, in four distinct locations, in different environment and usage conditions.},

abstract = {For Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs), the security of sensitive data of patients is of the utmost importance, particularly in healthcare environments. This study presents a novel methodology for improving the efficacy of signature aggregation in a scenario involving doctors and patients while mitigating concerns about location privacy. Though there have been prior proposals for signature aggregation schemes, the proposed approach seeks to optimize the aggregation process within the considered scenario, thereby improving performance and reducing computational and communication burden. In addition, the proposed scheme integrates a resilient mechanism that safeguards the doctor’s location privacy by utilizing the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). Advanced cryptographic algorithms and location-anonymization techniques are employed in the proposed method to safeguard the confidentiality of the doctors’ location. The security of the proposed scheme is formally analyzed using the Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic and formally verified using the automated software validation tool, known as the Scyther tool, and an informal analysis of various security attributes confirms the security robustness of the proposed scheme. The efficacy is evaluated in comparison to analogous works utilizing the Cygwin software. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme has lower communication costs as compared to existing competing schemes. Moreover, the serving ratio in the proposed scheme is high even if the number of patients is low for doctors.},

abstract = {Software performance modeling plays a crucial role in developing and maintaining software systems. A performance model analytically describes the relationship between the performance of a system and its runtime activities. This process typically examines various aspects of a system’s runtime behavior, such as the execution frequency of functions or methods, to forecast performance metrics like program execution time. By using performance models, developers can predict expected performance and thereby effectively identify and address unexpected performance regressions when actual performance deviates from the model’s predictions. One common and precise method for capturing performance behavior is software tracing, which involves instrumenting the execution of a program, either at the kernel level (e.g., system calls) or application level (e.g., function calls). However, due to the nature of tracing, it can be highly resource-intensive, making it impractical for production environments where resources are limited. In this work, we propose statistical approaches to reduce tracing overhead by identifying and excluding performance-insensitive code regions, particularly application-level functions, from tracing while still building accurate performance models that can capture execution time degradations. We develop both dynamic methods that analyze runtime behavior patterns and static methods that examine code structure to identify performance-sensitive functions. Our methodology specifically targets execution time as the primary performance metric, building models that capture the relationship between function call frequencies and overall program latency. By selecting an optimal set of functions to be traced, we can construct optimized performance models that achieve an R2 score of up to 99\% and, in some cases, outperform full tracing models (i.e., models using non-optimized tracing data), while significantly reducing the tracing overhead by more than 80\% in most cases. Our optimized performance models can also effectively detect performance regressions in our studied programs, demonstrating their usefulness in distinguishing between normal workload variations and actual performance degradations. Finally, our approach is fully automated, making it ready to be used in production environments with minimal human effort.},

abstract = {Biodiversity conservation in fragmented and remote ecosystems often requires labour-intensive, time-consuming fieldwork, placing staff at risk and limiting the scope of long-term monitoring. To address these challenges in a sustainable, locally adaptable manner, we present BearWave, a novel, place-based HF communication framework attuned to local infrastructure constraints and designed to support low-power sensing networks under severe radio-frequency (RF) conditions. By leveraging Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS) propagation and the FT8 digital modulation technique, BearWave achieves reliable, bidirectional data transfer—even in dense tropical rainforest conditions—while keeping costs under £200 per node and enabling extended battery-powered operation. A case study in UK woodlands, chosen as an environmental analogue to Borneo’s rainforest, demonstrated BearWave’s robustness and adaptability: despite dense vegetation and non-line-of-sight paths, the system maintained over 90\% message reliability at distances of up to 25 km using only 1 W of RF power. Notably, the strongest signal propagation and best reception rates occurred during nighttime, reflecting diurnal ionospheric variations. These empirical results confirm that BearWave outperforms conventional technologies such as LoRaWAN or satellite systems in harsh, attenuating environments, offering a scalable, energy-efficient approach that lowers both ecological footprints and staff labor risks. This research advances conservation-focused communication by providing a universal, scientifically validated framework capable of supporting long-term ecological monitoring, poacher detection, and improved animal welfare. Crucially, BearWave’s low-cost, low-impact design broadens access for under-resourced organisations and community-driven conservation programs, where local knowledge and stakeholder insights help shape technology decisions on the ground. By embracing a socio-technical innovation model, BearWave exemplifies how computing can be sustainably embedded in remote ecosystems worldwide.},

abstract = {Digital technologies, particularly Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks, have the potential to improve coordination and decision-making in community-managed dam operations, especially in rural and decentralized water systems. Despite advancements in real-time sensing and data-driven management, barriers such as fragmented governance, limited data accessibility, and operational constraints continue to hinder effective coordination across watersheds. Semi-structured interviews with dam operators in the Huron River watershed (Michigan, USA) identified critical institutional, operational, and technological challenges, including regulatory constraints on dam operations, reliance on manual flow monitoring, and a lack of accessible forecasting tools. To address these challenges, a low-cost, IoT-based decision support tool was developed and tested, integrating real-time sensor data, hydrologic conditions, and ecological forecasting into a web-based application. Results indicate that intuitive, data-driven interfaces improve information sharing, enhance operator trust in automation, and support watershed-scale coordinated management. Findings suggest that scalable IoT networks, when combined with human-centered design, bridge the gap between data availability and actionable decision making, ultimately fostering more adaptive, coordinated water resource management.},

abstract = {Cervical cancer is a significant global health concern for women. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) offers a non-invasive, high-resolution imaging method for cervical examinations. The clinical need for real-time AI-aided diagnosis in low-resource settings necessitates model compression for deep learning models. Therefore, we develop a novel activation map-based knowledge distillation (AMKD) framework to address this issue. The AMKD framework ensures that the compressed (student) model achieves classification performance approximating that of the teacher model while maintaining the same activation area, enhancing interpretability for gynecologists. Due to the lack of high-quality annotated data, we also utilize unlabeled images for self-supervised distillation pre-training to improve model performance. On an internal dataset, the compressed models based on ResNet, ConvNeXt, and Swin-Transformer outperformed existing knowledge distillation frameworks while demonstrating better interpretability. On two external validation sets, the best compressed (ResNet) model surpassed the average performance of four medical experts in sensitivity and negative predictive value for cervical OCT volume classification, showcasing enhanced lesion detection capabilities. For a cervical OCT image of 760 \texttimes{} 1200 pixels, the compressed ResNet model with 1.37&nbsp;M parameters uses 1.13&nbsp;GB GPU memory during inference and predicts the input image in 0.06 seconds, potentially improving real-time detection of cervical lesions in resource-limited clinical settings.},

abstract = {Spatial tensors have been extensively used in a wide range of applications, including remote sensing, geospatial information systems, conservation planning, and urban planning. We study the problem of Spatially Compact Dense (SCD) block mining in a spatial tensor, which targets for discovering dense blocks that cover small spatial regions. However, most of existing dense block mining (DBM) algorithms cannot solve the SCD-block mining problem since they only focus on maximizing the density of candidate blocks, so that the discovered blocks are spatially loose, i.e., covering large spatial regions. Therefore, we first formulate the problem of mining top-k Spatially Compact Dense blocks (SCD-blocks) in spatial tensors, which ranks SCD-blocks based on a new scoring function that takes both the density value and the spatial coverage into account. Then, we adopt a filter-refinement framework that first generates candidate SCD-blocks with good scores in the filtering phase and then uses the traditional DBM algorithm to further maximize the density values of the candidates in the refinement phase. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we develop two types of solutions in the filtering phase, namely the top-down solution and the bottom-up solution, which can find good candidate SCD-blocks by approximately solving the new scoring function. The evaluations on four real datasets verify that compared with the dense blocks returned by existing DBM algorithms, the proposed solutions are able to find SCD-blocks with comparable density values and significantly smaller spatial coverage.},

abstract = {Food-centered study has received more attention in the multimedia community for its profound impact on our survival, nutrition and health, pleasure, and enjoyment. Our experience of food is typically multi-sensory: We see food objects, smell its odors, taste its flavors, feel its texture, and hear sounds when chewing. Therefore, multimodal food learning is vital in food-centered study, which aims to relate information from multiple food modalities to support various multimedia tasks, ranging from recognition, retrieval, generation, recommendation, and interaction, enabling applications in different fields like healthcare and agriculture. However, there is no surveys on this topic to our knowledge. To fill this gap, this article formalizes multimodal food learning and comprehensively surveys its typical tasks, technical achievements, existing datasets, and applications to provide the blueprint with researchers and practitioners. Based on the current state of the art, we identify both open research issues and promising research directions, such as multimodal food learning benchmark construction, multimodal food foundation model construction, and multimodality diet estimation. We also point out that closer cooperation from researchers between multimedia and food science can handle some existing challenges and meanwhile open up more new opportunities to advance the fast development of multimodal food learning. This is the first comprehensive survey in this topic and we anticipate about 170 reviewed research articles can benefit academia and industry in this community and beyond.},

abstract = {The measurement of bladder volume serves as an essential tool for urinary health management, especially among people with age-related bladder dysfunction or neurological bladder issues, or developmental bladder problems. Patients who have neurogenic bladder or limited mobility, or spinal cord injuries, need ongoing precise monitoring as a preventive measure against complications. Current solutions face challenges because they depend on operators and consume too much power while being inflexible. We present a wearable bladder monitoring (WBM) sensor with dual configurations: a 32-channel setup for Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) applications and an optimized 5-channel design for urinary incontinence (UI) management. The 5-channel configuration operates at low power while using A-mode imaging to measure bladder volume precisely through a simple hardware design that supports wearable implementation. The 32-channel configuration demonstrates its capability for advanced diagnostic uses by producing high-quality B-mode images through single-plane wave imaging while functioning as a proof-of-concept. The 5-channel WBM system demonstrates equivalent accuracy ((pm 5\%) to (6\%)) when measuring bladder volumes between 50 to 200 mL compared to the Verasonics platform while using much less power in in-vitro experiments with bladder phantoms. The 32-channel setup was tested for imaging quality metrics, including contrast and generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR) to demonstrate its potential for advanced imaging applications. The WBM platform combines wireless data transmission with flexibility and efficiency to create a versatile wearable ultrasound device platform for clinical and homecare environments.},

abstract = {As Human Robot Collaboration (HRC) technologies continue to advance, robots are increasingly being deployed to assist in various settings, including manufacturing, healthcare, and home environments. A critical aspect of designing safe and adaptable HRC systems is the ability to assess and monitor an individual’s Cognitive Fatigue (CF) during interactions with robots. This is especially important in ensuring safe and effective environments, as fluctuations in CF can affect both performance and safety. Although prior research has explored cognitive workload and fatigue, a significant gap exists in understanding how to effectively measure and manage CF in real-time during HRC. This paper reviews current technologies for CF assessment in HRC systems, examining self-reported assessments, cognitive activity induction, physiological sensors, and behavioral analysis. Furthermore, it investigates the safety and effectiveness of assistive robots in supporting individuals with Activities of Daily Living (ADL), highlighting key challenges in detecting and responding to CF. This paper can potentially guide future research on developing robotics for long-term care that focuses on enhancing human well-being and autonomy within HRC systems.},

abstract = {The strategic placement of 2D-LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors is critical for a wide range of applications in smart indoor environments, including security, fall detection, and elderly care monitoring. This paper introduces and validates a novel 2D-LiDAR coverage algorithm designed to address significant challenges such as blind spots and shadow minimization. By extending existing grid-based methodologies, the proposed algorithm incorporates multi-directional coverage requirements to ensure that each grid cell is reliably monitored from multiple perspectives. This enhancement reduces the likelihood of undetected areas and improves the overall resilience of the system to occlusions. Furthermore, the algorithm optimizes sensor placement to minimize hardware requirements while maintaining comprehensive spatial coverage. The algorithm’s performance is rigorously evaluated through both simulated and real-world experiments. The simulations modeled a typical and simple indoor environment with one large static obstacle to validate the effectiveness of the sensor placement strategy in achieving full coverage with minimal overlap. Real-world experiments, utilizing RPLidar A1M8 sensors, confirm the simulation results and demonstrate the practical feasibility of the algorithm in detecting and tracking movement throughout the test environment, including in regions prone to occlusions. These results emphasize the algorithm’s suitability for high-reliability applications such as fall detection in elderly care settings and continuous monitoring in smart environments. This work not only validates the practical applicability of the proposed approach but also provides a foundation for its adaptation to more complex scenarios, paving the way for advancements in sensor network design and deployment in diverse real-world contexts.},

For the realization of CBTA, dependable quantifiable and context-aware information of the trainee’s behavior is essential. We extract information of flight state and pilot-machine interaction from the simulator software, we model the 3-D scene of the cockpit environment and incorporate the trainee’s gaze information from the eye tracking technology and the head pose using 3-D tracking from a Varjo XR3 headset, which is part of the flight simulator. With this information we achieve a deep temporal and spatial understanding of interaction, behavior and visual attention of the pilot. Our behavioral analysis framework models the pilot’s behavior from observations using somatic indicators and sensors and deducts competency skill levels of the pilot, following the CBTA guidelines of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). With our work we contribute an assistive system for pilots and flight training instructors, aiming to complement and improve assessment of training performance, providing additional information.},

abstract = {The growing aging population, combined with a shortage of healthcare personnel, poses a critical challenge in many developed nations. Maintaining older adults in their homes has become an essential priority to address this issue. Smart homes are emerging as a viable solution, offering continuous monitoring of daily activities and timely assistance when required. While most research has centered on tracking broad activities such as eating, walking, or sleeping, detecting errors in task execution demands a system capable of identifying fine-grained steps in real-time. To tackle this challenge, we introduced an innovative algorithmic method for fine-grained gesture recognition last year, leveraging photoplethysmography sensors. Although our initial results demonstrated the potential of this approach, they were limited in scope. In this paper, we present a comprehensive new study using a more rigorous experimental protocol. This includes collecting much more precise data from the two hands instead of one, taking into account the wristband tension, the skin color that affect the rate sensing accuracy, and testing various machine learning techniques on a new dataset collected through a wristband equipped with an accelerometer and photoplethysmography sensors. The new dataset, comprising labeled atomic cooking gestures performed by participants, has been made publicly available for the scientific community. Our updated experiments achieved an promising accuracy of 94\%, further highlighting the untapped potential of photoplethysmography sensors in smart home applications for assistive activity recognition, an area where their use remains largely unexplored.},

abstract = {As the need for comprehensive care for the elderly grows, there is a rising emphasis on occupational management rather than solely on surveillance. This study aims to develop an advanced activity monitoring system that integrates positional data and IMU sensor data from devices positioned throughout the home environment. Previous systems have effectively addressed fundamental movements such as walking, sitting, and lying down; however, they fall short in detecting lateral and physical activities. This research seeks to expand the functionality of existing systems by enhancing the model's capabilities through targeted training, enabling it to accurately identify intricate activities such as sleeping, inactivity, extended walking, and anomalies (lying in the toilet). During test site evaluations, the system achieved 84.27\% accuracy for high-level activity predictions, significantly outperforming low-level predictions at the same site, which achieved 76.29\% accuracy. These advancements highlight the system's potential for real-world application, offering efficient and reliable detection of complex activities to promote greater independence for elderly individuals and reduce caregiving burdens.},

abstract = {As dynamic environments become more complex, the need for autonomous decision making in high-dimensional state and action spaces increases. In this paper, we propose a multi-intelligent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework based on evolutionary game theory and designed for parallel training in multiple environments. The framework addresses the challenges of algorithmic overfitting, slow convergence, and inefficient training by integrating multi-reward systems and introducing selection and mutation mechanisms inspired by collective intelligence. These enhancements improve learning efficiency and exploration, while ensuring robustness against adaptive adversaries through self-play training. Simulation result show that the proposed framework offers greater adaptability, faster convergence, and lower hyperparameter sensitivity than the classical approach. The results show that this approach enables agents to develop effective strategies and autonomous decision-making capabilities. This highlights its potential for applications in complex and dynamic systems such as robotics, autonomous navigation, and multi-agent coordination.},

abstract = {Under the development of sensing technology, human behavior recognition based on sensor signals is now a key technology in intelligent health monitoring, smart home and human-computer interaction. Especially the real time accurate recognition of human behavior sequence has great practical significance in improving user experience and intelligence of the system in these applications. Meanwhile, traditional human behavior recognition methods always suffer some problems, such as noise interference, unstable signal and insufficient ability of features extraction, thus it is particularly important to improve the accuracy and robustness of the recognition algorithm. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning model named VMDFormer, which is built through the introduction of Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and Channel Self-Attention Mechanism (SE-Attention) to a deep neural network. Specifically, the model combines VMD with Random Forest algorithm and introduces the mechanism of SE-Attention for feature representation. Through VMD decomposition to extract multi-scale feature from the data, the key feature in VMD decomposition are used by the Random Forest algorithm. Besides, the feature representation is deepened by introducing Channel Attention. In the experiments, we design the proposed method and compare with the baseline method. The results show that the proposed approach can obtain excellent performance with classification rate of 98.65 \%. This work can provide the efficient and robust method for human behavior recognition, and the synergistic combination of Channel Attention mechanism and the multi-scale signal decomposition will also be a useful guide in Intelligent Health Monitoring and Human computer Interaction field.},

abstract = {Sequential recommendation aims to learn users' dynamic preferences from their historical interactions and predict the next item they are most likely to engage with. In real-world scenarios, time-varying factors (e.g., product promotions, seasonal changes) induce distribution shifts in user interactions. Despite the demonstrated success of existing models, their generalization capability remains limited under such dynamic conditions. Current methods tackle this challenge by leveraging distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to optimize the "worst-case" loss or by employing manually designed data augmentation to enrich the training distribution. Despite their effectiveness, DRO-based approaches are inherently constrained by the sparsity of training data, limiting the range of distributions they can model, while manually designed augmentations risk introducing noise or irrelevant information that could distort user preference learning. Furthermore, these methods often overlook the sensitivity of user interactions to distribution shifts, which is essential for capturing the stable factors in the evolution of user preferences in real-world settings.In this work, we tackle the distribution shifting problem from the perspective of invariant learning. We propose a novel framework called Invariant Learning for Distribution Shifts in SEquential RecommendAtion (IDEA) to develop robust sequential recommendation. The key of IDEA lies on learning stable preferences across various distribution-aware environments. Since explicit environments are unavailable, we first extract multiple subsequences by dropping potential noise items, then extend environments with our proposed subsequence mixup. Given the simulated environments, IDEA then learns stable user preferences through invariant risk minimization (IRM) across various environments. To encourage the diversity of simulated environments, IDEA employs an adversarial training strategy to explore potential diverse environments, and further enhance the model's generalization to unseen test distributions. It is worth mentioning that IDEA is a flexible model-agnostic framework, which is applicable to various sequential recommendation models. Extensive experimental results on three public datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hermione314/IDEA.},

abstract = {Environmental stressors such as temperature, humidity, vibration, and radiation can severely impact the performance and reliability of SSDs, particularly in edge, automotive, aerospace, and datacenter deployments. Capturing sensor data in the field and conducting accelerated lab experiments are challenging, as they are time-consuming, resource-intensive, and often destructive to hardware. Specialized setups, such as thermal chambers or vibration rigs, are also required, which is why few studies explore this area, and current storage management techniques like RAID, tiering, and deduplication do not consider environmental factors. Models to capture these impacts would open new research opportunities across various fields. However, accurately modeling these effects remains challenging due to, (1) the limited availability of experimental data, (2) the complex, domino-like impact of historical exposure, (3) the interrelated nature of environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity, which exhibit correlation, (4) different response of each type of NAND flash memory TLC, MLC, and SLC to environmental factors, and (5) the difficulty that analytical and simple machine learning models face in generalizing across devices, environments, and unseen combinations of stressors. We believe that LLMs may offer a transformative alternative to this complex problem, with embedded domain knowledge and reasoning capabilities, to facilitate prompt-based natural language interaction. We propose a hybrid framework that combines Chain-of-Thought prompting and Retrieval-Augmented Generation to guide LLMs using physical principles and prior experiments. It enables interpretable "what-if" analysis of SSD behavior under environmental changes. Our results show that the LLM can effectively model the impact of temperature, humidity, and vibration on SSD performance, producing tail latency and bandwidth predictions with minimal error.

abstract = {The rapid expansion of wireless communication and the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to a growing need for real-time data processing. Traditional cloud computing architectures often struggle to meet the low latency, high bandwidth, and low energy consumption requirements of certain applications. In response, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising solution, offloading data processing closer to the user's device at the network's edge, significantly reducing system overhead. This enables more efficient handling of latency-sensitive and energy-efficient applications. One critical challenge in MEC research is optimizing the offloading of computational tasks from user devices to edge nodes, while fully utilizing idle resources to minimize operational overhead and enhance Quality of Service (QoS). This paper focuses on offloading algorithms in a multi-user, multi-edge-node environment, where each user device generates tasks with dependency constraints. The goal is to minimize total system overhead. We propose a parametric modeling approach for task offloading and introduce a Multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (M-DDPG) algorithm to solve the offloading strategy. The M-DDPG algorithm, deployed at the edge layer, is designed to optimize offloading decisions based on state space, observations, action space, and reward mechanisms. Experimental results show that the M-DDPG algorithm outperforms the traditional S-DDPG algorithm in terms of convergence and achieves lower total system overhead, improving overall performance in the edge network environment.},

abstract = {In today's manufacturing environment, troubleshooting and data analysis of industrial equipment is a challenging task. With the rapid development of industrial automation and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, modern industrial systems generate a large amount of heterogeneous sensor data, but traditional analysis methods face three key limitations: difficulty in meeting real-time processing constraints, challenges in extracting features from multi-source data, and poor reliability under complex operating conditions.In this study, a deep learning-based data analysis algorithm designed for industrial applications is proposed to address these challenges. To achieve efficient extraction and fusion of spatio-temporal features from industrial sensor data, the algorithm introduces a novel dual-stream feature learning architecture combining CNN and LSTM networks with an attention mechanism. The algorithm has demonstrated excellent performance with 94.3\% fault diagnosis accuracy, 8.3ms average processing latency and robust operation under a variety of industrial conditions when implemented in a real production environment of 12 production lines. Deployments have shown that it is a valuable solution for smart manufacturing, significantly improving the efficiency of equipment maintenance and reducing unplanned downtime.},

This study develops a Temporal Fusion Network (TFN) approach utilizing easily accessible physiological parameters (heart rate, heart rate reserve, tidal volume, and breathing frequency), which can be measured with wearable sensors, anthropometric variables (age, gender, height, and weight), as well as health status to estimate  (dot{mathrm{V}}mathrm{O}_{2})  dynamics during cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). These input physiological parameters were derived from 140 laboratory CPET of a diverse cohort of adults (90 males, 50 females; 77 healthy, 63 smokers; average age: 26.6 years), to analyze  (dot{mathrm{V}}mathrm{O}_{2}) dynamics. The TFN model demonstrated high predictive accuracy to estimate  (dot{mathrm{V}}mathrm{O}_{2}) dynamics, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.03 L/min and an R-squared (R2) value of 0.92, indicating robust performance across varied population groups. This TFN model paves the way for practical and cost-effective approach to estimate  (dot{mathrm{V}}mathrm{O}_{2}) during exercise, with potential integration with consumer health devices to expand accessibility and, enhance its utility for clinical and fitness applications.},

abstract = {Computing near the source of data has been proven effective in terms of energy conservation, latency improvement, and privacy preservation. With this, edge intelligence refers to local CNN inference in embedded edge devices. Because edge devices are highly resource-constrained, in practice they store CNN model(s) in external flash memory and load them (or part of) during runtime inference. However, flash memory is subject to time-related retention errors, and thus a dilemma is that without error correction, a CNN model in flash memory quickly deteriorates and becomes useless. On the other hand, strong error correction involves extra read sensing and read retrying. Due to the concern of reliability, the lineup of embedded serial flash memory offers low-density solutions only. In this study, we investigate graceful degradation of CNN models in uncorrected high-density flash storage for edge intelligence. Inspired by the observation that in popular CNN models, the majority of CNN weight parameters share a few monotonic bit patterns in their high-order bits, we propose mapping the frequent bit patterns to low flash-cell voltage levels for protection against retention errors. Furthermore, as CNN layers show different levels of tolerance to bit errors, we also propose using adaptive cell-bit density to provide non-uniform error protection among layers. We conducted experiments on popular CNN designs, including VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, under realistic effects of flash aging. Results show that with prior methods, the inference accuracy of ResNet50 degrades to 70.7\% in just three months; by contrast, with our approach, the degradation is less than 1\% and the accuracy remains at 91.6\% after one year of retention.},

However, it should be noted that some algorithms exhibit unsatisfactory steady-state performance when confronted with non-Gaussian noise, particularly impulsive noise. To address the above issue, the filtered-x kernel risk-sensitive loss (FxKRSL) algorithm is proposed, which adopts KRSL as the optimization criterion. In this paper, in order to further enhance the robustness of FxKRSL, we develop the filtered-x normalized kernel risk-sensitive loss (FxNKRSL) algorithm, which incorporates the normalized method.

Compared with traditional methods, big data has the advantages of large capacity, multiple types, fast processing and high precision, providing new technical support for the precision of health management. In the past, our methods of collecting and analyzing health data have been difficult to meet the current needs of people for personalized and intelligent services. Although traditional methods can process health data to a certain extent, they often seem to be unable to cope with large-scale data processing, real-time monitoring and the generation of personalized suggestions. With the help of big data technology, we can now realize the real-time collection, processing and analysis of large-scale health data, bringing new ideas and methods to improve the health level of the whole people. However, there are still many problems in the current sports health management system, especially in scientific guidance and personalized strategies. Many people lack accurate guidance when exercising, which not only affects the effect of exercise, but also may increase the risk of injury. In response to these problems, we proposed a set of intelligent sports health management system based on big data. The system integrates sensor networks, Internet of Things devices and cloud computing platforms, and can automatically complete the collection, collation, storage and dynamic analysis of health data. At the same time, it can accurately monitor personal health status and provide personalized exercise suggestions based on the analysis results. Compared with traditional methods, this system has obvious advantages in providing personalized guidance and preventing sports injuries. It can effectively make up for the shortcomings of existing methods and bring people more scientific and efficient health management solutions.},

Our process involves observing and modeling the real-world RPM context, crafting synthetic datasets, and iteratively prototyping a simplified RPM system that balances contextual richness and intentional abstraction. Through this iterative process of sensemaking through making, designers can still develop context familiarity, when direct access to the actual healthcare system is limited.

These artefacts celebrate the vitality and agency of once-living sea-derived matter, prompting curiosity about where these materials come from, how they transform, and what kinds of stories they might tell.},

abstract = {In today’s digital age, interfaces such as keyboards and screens define our daily interactions. Unfortunately, their mainstream aesthetic based on hard inorganic materials, has contributed to unsustainable consumption and environmental challenges, such as the extensive use of non-renewable resources and an electronic waste crisis. In addition, their design homogeneity limits the sensorial aesthetic experience for users. As an alternative, emerging research in electronic textiles explores the use of renewable, biodegradable materials to create flexible fabric interfaces. This approach challenges traditional aesthetics by introducing crafted organic devices that embrace circular design principles. This work examines the unique aesthetics of a bio-based eTextile interface, focusing on its particular material properties. Through first-person observation, I discuss the characteristics of a prototype using philosophical aesthetic concepts organised in three themes: Imperfections, Heterogeneity, and Ephemerality. I argue that embracing the particular aesthetics of bio-based eTextiles could provide sensory-rich experiences, foster sustainable consumption patterns, and redefine aesthetic preferences for our future physical-digital interactions.},

abstract = {This study presents Critter Connect Critter Connect, a wearable device fostering, multispecies relationships in natural ecosystems. Grounded in posthuman theory and More-than-Human geography, the work responds to human-centred design limitations, which often overlook non-visual and non-linguistic modes of interaction. It also highlights the need for practical tools fostering direct, place-specific, and non-hierarchical sensory-rich engagements with other beings. This pictorial shows the device's potential to enable spontaneous and embodied interactions between users and three species in a biodiversity-rich ecosystem through geolocation-based tactile and auditory feedback. We present a design process building on multispecies ethics and speculative methods to address ecological care, as well as a pilot study demonstrating Critter Connect's capacity to amplify the wearer's awareness of unseen multispecies presences and sense of connection to nature. This research contributes to HCI by offering a framework for designing ethically considerate, sensory-rich interactions with other beings, thus challenging human-centric engagement and promoting ecological cohabitation.},

abstract = {Power side-channel attacks exploit variations in power consumption to recover sensitive information. To design secure systems, we must consider all the leakage sources to ensure that attackers cannot exploit any weakness. However, they can greatly vary between different processor microarchitectures and their internal mechanisms. Particularly, with the growing interest in the open-source RISC-V ISA and its numerous implementations, generic tools and strategies become essential to finely evaluate the security offered by each system.In this paper we present PowerSecBench, a software environment to evaluate power leakages on RISC-V processors. Starting from a range of various in-order implementations, from single-cycle to superscalar designs, we show how PowerSecBench allows characterizing leakages in each of them considering both value- and transition-based leakages. It uses a set of configurable microbenchmarks to test the different microarchitectural features. By simply executing them on both simulated and real FPGA targets, it becomes possible to identify most of the hardware sources, as well as consider physical parameters. Finally, we show that PowerSecBench can also be used to study the impact and limitations of protection strategies, such as pure software fences.},

abstract = {Sensory perception plays a fundamental role in how we interpret and relate to people and our environment. While verbal communication dominates much of our interaction, nonverbal forms, such as haptics, present alternatives for connection. This pictorial investigates the potential of haptic interaction through an iterative prototyping process, culminating in SYMBIONT—a pair of bioinspired soft robotic objects designed for affective tactile communication across distances or in shared spaces.SYMBIONT emerges from three prototypes—HiPalm, EmoLink, and OctoTouch—each exploring different dimensions of tactile expression. The final design enables users to engage in tactile communication through embedded bend and pressure sensors paired with actuators that pulse, vibrate, and curl.The prototyping approach integrates metaphorical frameworks, biomorphic aesthetics, and biomimetic behavior. Methods include sketch-based ideation, annotated portfolios, and Research through Design, all contributing to developing a responsive tactile system. This research explores how such mediums might enhance physical presence and open new possibilities for tactile, bioinspired, and sensory communication systems.},

abstract = {Culturally sensitive design is crucial for developing inclusive technologies, particularly in resource-constrained settings. However, such approaches often oversimplify culture and face challenges in cross-cultural relevance. This study addresses these issues by exploring how participatory design can be both culturally grounded and adaptable across subcultures within African communities. We conducted 13 distributed design workshops with 19 participants, including people with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), caregivers, and pharmacists, from diverse ethnic groups in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. These workshops informed the design of a mobile health prototype featuring interactive flows in Pidgin English, collaborative care tools, peer support groups, and a calorie prediction feature. The prototype was evaluated by 30 participants through think-aloud sessions and interviews. Findings highlight that while some features aligned with local cultural norms, others were less effective across sociocultural boundaries, even within the same city. We offer insights and methodological guidance for developing digital health tools that are locally relevant and regionally adaptable.},

abstract = {In virtual reality (VR), our virtual body can have different characteristics from our real body, such as appearance, size, and even extra body parts. Previous research shows that haptic feedback enhances the user-perceived embodiment of those dissimilar avatars. In particular, weight-shifting devices showed the potential to enhance arm deformation. However, there has been no exploration of using such techniques to enhance embodiment with extra body parts, like wings. We introduce HapticWings, a back-wearable 2D weight-shifting device that provides haptic feedback for wing motions, enhancing the user embodiment of avatars with extra wings. In three user studies, we explored (1) users’ abilities to recognize different weight-shifting motions provided by HapticWings, (2) users’ perceived embodiment of avatars with extra wings when providing haptic feedback for wing motions, and (3) four possible applications and used two of them to evaluate users’ sense of realism and enjoyment in VR.},
